1," Brownish-amber coloured, thin, but firm and stable ""dirty"" white head; clean, sweet malty aroma"
1," (Old notes). A good belgian dubbel. Sweet, fruity, burnt sugar notes. I also found orange  peel too. A good beer from Chimay.
"
1," 330ml bottle.  Pours a clear copper brown color with excellent carbonation and a good brownish head.  Aroma is earthy and sweet, with a crisp hoppy scent of grapefruit and apricot along with a yeasty earthiness.  Taste is creamy and medium-bodied with a crisp fruity opening giving way to a tart hoppy finish.  Not quite in the same class as the other Chimays, but still a well done beer.
"
1," Bottle from BevMo in Vacaville, CA. Poured a reddish brown with a brown head. Like many other Belgian Strong Ales it smelled of dark fruits and just a hint of floral scents. Tasted of dried fruit, carmel and roasted malts. Hit the palate just right. WOW!!
"
1," draft. slightly hazed orange. cheese must and mold hop nose and flavor.  excessively bitter, chewy, syrupy and goopy texture, full-bodied.  resinous, raw, green, oily, moldy, ugh.  very, very difficult to enjoy.  brash, horrible flavor, unpalatable.
"
1," Thanks ScottyP for the hook up on this one. Pretty darn good little IPA. Best sessionable big IPA that Ive had in awhile. Nice spice component. Very fresh hop flavors with a nice lingering bitterness. Decent malt balance. All in all a nice beer.
"
1," Bottled - rich dark pour with small tan head - roasty, coffee aroma - fairly strong, dry, dark chocolate taste - really quite pleasant - a little thin near the finish, but otherwise a nice, drinkable stout.
"
1," Pours a murky dark orange amber color with a thick off-white head. Aroma is malt yeast a little floral.  Flavor is mice and balanced. Some good yeast and malt flavors. Very well balanced although a little hot. Nice Belgian.
"
1," Pale golden creamy white head.  Sweet aroma and flavor from the hops very light bodied with a hint of lingering bitterness.  A nice take on the light lager syle.
"
1," Just starting to learn to appreciate good beer.  I never understood what people meant by fruity..ect.  After trying my first Chimay Red, I do.  I really enjoyed this and can't wait to try the blue and the white.
"
1," A bit weak, roasted, berries, caramel. Flavor"
1," Absolutely beautiful! Nice clove and floral aroma/flavor. I actually enjoy this over the blue. I guess because it retains the wonderful complex aroma/flavor as the blue, but its a little easier to drink. Great great great great great!
"
1," on tap at brewpub. slight haze, pale yellow, decent head. cereals and herbs, fresh malts, orange-citrusy, wheat. lots of coriander and herbs, light but present grassy hopping, hint of sweetness. bubbly, light body.
"
1," the best of all three main version, it is strong with lots of fruity malts and a high alcohol content, lots of rich flavors. a must have for the beer snob.
"
1," Draft at Downtown Chattanooga location		Very English, as contrasted to the place mat description. Clearly outshined by the 375 that followed, just a bit too safe in the bitterness.
"
1," Dark brown with a tan foam. Fruity, yeasty with a dark caramel and vanilla finish. Maybe not the best Trappiste but very accessible.
"
1," JUL 3, 2009 Disney Boardwalk. On Tap. Props to Big River for brewing a brown ale to write home about. Oft maligned as a boring style, a good brown is difficult to come by. This one is earthy with a lightly sweet mouth-filling malty character balanced with just a touch of hops at the finish. Bordering on a brown porter, this brown makes a fantastically flavorful session beer that goes well with standard bar sandwich fare. It is also appealling to the eye with a dark brown body capped with a rocky resilient tan head. Solid lacing leaves a poignant reminder of how good a brown ale can be. 07/02/2009 - Had this on tap at Rock Bottom in Charlotte. Still one of the better browns Ive had. Residual earthy sweetness seemed stronger.
"
1," Pours solid orange color, decent head and lots of chunks floating around as well. Head dispersed rather quickly though. Kinda sour and too bitter for my tasting, glad I didnt buy the 6pack of this.
"
1," This beer has strong fizz and light peach flavor off the top, but its overall strength leaves no doubt that this special beverage is indeed a beer with a hearty soul. A soul that makes me want to chant in an incense filled room.
"
1," 33cl Bottle at home - expires end of 2010	Massive brown color with a tiny head, looks good.	Full aroma of caramel, roasty, herbs, licorice, raisin.	medium bitterness and sweetness, full body, lively carbonation with a nice bitter finish.
"
1," Pours deep amber-brown with almost cloudy look to it. Huge foaming tight beige head, half of it dissapeared rather quickly though, decent retention of the rest. Dark fruit aroma with a hint of smoke/roasted grains to it. Complex taste, very fruity and sweet but beautifully balanced. Hints of spice/clove to it as well. Lovely smooth full mouthfeel. Hint of alcohol as you get further into it, Top drop.
"
1," (swing top bottle) Cloudy, golden colour with a mid-sized foamy white head. Sour citrus-fruity nose with a moderate wheaty nose with a tinge of banana and diacetyl. Moderately sour flavour, light to medium bodied with a moderate, almost a bit flat carbonation. Sourish wheat-malty and citrus-fruity taste with shy notes of cloves; dry and citric wheaty finish with light spicy notes. A rather mediocre Weizen. 06.I.10
"
1," Excellent!  Many brew dubbels, but this one might be the benchmark.  Plenty of malt brilliance and a perfect mouthfeel.  I will look for another dubbel to top this balanced beauty.
"

"
1," Had this many times at the import beer bar, The Brussels in Kanda, Tokyo. Rich, smooth, flowery and fruity-dark fruits and sugars, strong yeast and malt, big body and big head, thick lacing, high sugar content and lots of glycerin.
"
1," of all trappists, this is the one that lets me down the most	great looks (what colour) and aroma, but somewhat disappointingly weak taste, especially when you consider the thin aftertaste
"
1," Osaka International Hostel with Jonpol, a German physics major  Bought"
1," Bottle 330ml, 2008. Reddish brown colour, creamy beige head. Aroma has fruits, chocolate and cherry in it. Flavor is smooth and rich, chocolate, fruits, malts and caramel in it. Alcohol comes up in the aftertaste. Very well balanced, even this particular bottle wasnt as old as some Bleues Ive drank.
"
1," 7/27/04.  Poured out of 330 mL bottle, bought at Stuffed Sandwich in San Gabriel, CA 7/27/04.  Pours a muddy dark brown with dark red-brown outline.  Very fluffy head that comes out the top of the bottle within a minute.  Tan-gray head lingers, pretty dense but uneven.  Outstanding lacing.  Aroma aint no thang.  Good but not amazing.  Flavor has bright yeast, candi sugar with some faint plum, overripe fruit, strong alcohol, dusty cupboards (?!), and some cake.  Medium body, feels like its breaking apart under the carbonation.  Nice activity, but theres also a weird divide.  Finish is smooth and growing with an impressive boost at first, darkly fruity, bready, and sugary with candi and brown sugar.  A slight hint of dark roast malt.  Good beer, but the aging potential on this is where its at.  Id much prefer it with a few years under its belt.
"
1," Thanks to Oakes for sharing this bottle.  Thick brown head over a pitch black beer.  Sweet chocolate/vanilla aroma with some definite oaty type of aroma.  Flavour seems a bit hot (especially considering its only 4.9%).  Lots of oakiness but with less vanilla than woodiness.  Woody complexity in the flavour but comes across with a bit of astringency as well.  Slightly overcarbonated as well.  Not bad, but definitely not great.
"
1," Pours a beautiful deep, dark copper color with ruby highlights.  Complex aroma; fresh and earthy.  Complex flavor as well; starts off sweet and turns tart and dry for the finish.  As this ale warms in my glass, it becomes less sweet and the malts take on a roasted quality.  Very nice beer!  Serve chilled, not cold.
"
1," Pretty much smells like a belgian when you open it up. Most of its points comes from the rich smoky vapor that pours out of the bottle when you pop the cap. I really love that. The beer itself isnt as good as people rate it. There is some complexity. I taste the malt, I detect the ""flowery aroma"", but you know....it really isnt in the same ballpark as the westy 8 or any rochefort stuff. It is FAR from a bad beer, but it doesnt deserve to be in the 99 percentile. Keep in mind that such beers as aventinus,stone IPA, and many other excellent beers  are in the 99 percentile or less category. Perhaps I just dont ""get"" why this beer is so great.The only reason to get this beer instead of an arrogant bastard is....well....honestly....I wouldnt know why you would...
"
1," bottle, courtesy of pivnizub. Cloudy golden colour, large white head. Yeasty, wheaty and slightly fruity (banana9, with a dry and smooth palate.
"
1," What took me so long to try this one?..Poured dark brown with red high lights.  Spice and fruit in the nose and taste. This is an excellent trappist.
"
1," FEB 29, 2008 Wonderful overall beer! High carbonation with dark color. Medium bodied and smooth. Very good overall experience.
"
1," slightly strawy malty with light grainy notes and just a whiff of floral hops. Moderately sweet flavour, light to medium bodied with a very pleasantly soft carbonation. Mildly malty, slightly grainy base with a late arriving hoppy bitterness and herbal and floral accents, combined with subtle notes of honey in the aftertaste. Well-rounded brew, pleasant to drink. 09.V.10
"
1," Mud brown color with nice frothy head. Little detectable aroma. Easy-drinking, light on the malt.  Medium-bodied, with a good mouthfeel, easy malt flavor, but rather non-descript.
"
1," Nothing to add that is not in the other reviews as far as flavor and aroma.  For all the hype, I expected more, but its not a bad beer and is one I will drink again.
"
1," Clovey sweet and cola spicy nose.  Cloudy amber/brown color, some hints of red, nice frothy long-lasting head.  Malty caramel sweetness, raisins and light toasted white bread.  Easy bitterness and some tartness, provides a fantastic balance.  Mouth feel is full and carbonation is creamy and silky.  Finish is long, complex, smooth, and has a nice late alcohol burn cutting through it all.  This is an amazing beer, a must try!
"
1," Bottle  Pours a clear brown with a large fizzy tan head.  Head is lasting even though its very fizzy.  Has a sweet fruity alcohol aroma.  I get grapes, raisins, some apples a real fruit mix.  Touches of cinnamon and nutmeg.  The aroma is excellent on this one.  Taste is on the dry side with a good mouthfeel.  The 9% is hidden very well.  Has a light feel.  Verysmooth and extremely drinkable.  The finish is subtle with a good duration.  Leaves a very pleasent taste without a real aftertaste.  This is a great beer.  Drinks like water, goes down with total ease.  If I could only drink one beer for the rest of my life this one deserves consideration.
"
1," MAR 2, 2005 Now this is something. Pleasently sweet (not too sweet), goes down well, but maybe a little watery (I never thought I would say that about a 9.0% beer). Dont get me wrong, this is a good beer but its not up there with the Westvleteren 12 and Rochefort 10s of this word. I prefered the Chimay Blanche.
"
1," sweet appel,yellow golden, clear, medium sweetness, medium body, creamy, soft carbonation, nice.
"
1,  floral hops with yeast and citrus fruits.  Palate was rich and filled the mouth.  Alcohol
1," On tap. This is a really light gold beer. Aroma is corny, papery. . .pretty straight up pale lager territory. This is clean and very light on the palate. The most notable flavor is of some papery hops going on. A weak malty profile is here. Lemon quality is not very strong. Pretty boring beer.
"
1," This is what a good strong beer should taste like...
"
1," Bottle from Chalet Party Shoppe in Goshen, IN. Pours a medium amber orange with sudsy off white head. Strange aroma of green hops, wet grains,  must, and yeast esters. Initial flavor of caramel, toasted grains, and tea that transitions to muted grassy hop middle. Finish had a slight citrus tartness. Some of the malt profile has a german vibe to it. Not bad, but its missing something that I can not pinpoint.

1," A nice orange color with a slight white head. Hops in the aroma and in the taste. The best beer I had at the Chattanooga brewery.
"
1," JAN 12, 2012 One of my all time favourites!! Great beer, the bigger the bottle, the better it gets!!		Update"
1," Nice full head. Dark brown/black stuff in the glass smells faintly of raisins and molasses. Smooth in the mouth, licorice, raisins and fig sweetness gather in the of the throat. Residue gathers at the sides of the tongue with rum and amaretto flavors. Previous bottles had not convinced me that this was all that great of a beer until I had this four year old from 99. Chimay should cellar them all for a couple of years after bottling, do not trust us we are heavy drinkers.
"
1," Thanks Tish! Black...no light gets through...fairly thick pour with a great dark brown head that settles into a thin film. aroma chocolate coffee and pine...a lot of pine in the aroma. bitter medium dry slightly acidic pine coffee flavor with hints of sweet chocolate. dry bitter slightly acidic coffee finish with lots of pine and sweet chocolate /cocoa notes. medium body. lively carbonation. nice coffee stout.
"
1," Bottled.  Clear nut brown, small head. Nutty peach aroma. Dryish and well rounded with vital malt profile but low hop rate. Bready with salty finish. A pleasant, very moreish and relaxed dunkel.
"
1," 33 cl.with a ""LAK 345 J-9"" bottling code; bottled sometime in 2002. Pours a orange-red color with an off white head. Has a vinous smell with a very dry, malty, grape sweet and spicy flavor. Light bodied with a lively bubbly mouthfeel. Jan 2004

"
1," Another great beer from Chimay, aroma, appearance and tests are all top a beer to be enjoyed.
"
1," Cloudy to the max, medium brown with a small tan blotchy head.  Fades quickly.  Aroma is yeast galore and fruit.  Flavors of, again, yeast, peach, pear, apples.  As it warms peppery spices show up that offers a nice addition.  What a good beer!
"
1," Medium brown in color. A nice head that dissipated quickly.  Aroma is chocolatey and nutty and the taste matches perfectly.  Smooth taste from start to finish with excellent flavors throughout.
"
1," On tap at the brewpub. Reddish brown pour with a thin ring of white foam. Aroma of molasses, cherries, malt and a bit of a nasty soy sauce. Taste is sweet, furity with a bit of roast bitterness and some booze. Palate is medium to heavy bodied, low carbonation. Pretty faultless, excePt for the aroma.
"
1," Bottled 12/05 -- Huge amount of carbonation... watch out for exploding bottles when opening.  Large, light tan head that quickly diminishes over a dark brown body.  Nice fruity aroma, maybe some flowery accents.  Good body, though somewhat astringent, roasted malts are present.  Somewhat light burn in the ending.
"
1," vary good belgum strong.  it has a mighty smooth tase that if vary good. I enjoy this beer every time I have it
"
1," Sampled at Viti, pours pale yellow. Flavour of muted malt and grains - not sweet. Better than the lagers.
"
1," Not much on the outside in color or aroma, but a fantastic bitter. Lighter body not too heavy on malts well balanced by bitters without drifting into an IPA. Warming.
"
1," Tasty dubbel.  Almost as nice as the Blue, better than the White.  Dark red color, silky smooth taste with fruity overtones.
"
1," (Bottle 50 cl) Pilsener golden with a handsome and stable, white head. Lightly hoppy aroma. Medium body with plenty of sweetish pilsener malt. Mildly hoppy finish with some floral accents. Well made. 190206
"
1," Appearance is a hazy nut brown color with a lot of sediment and effervescent bubbles. Citrus notes and a slight note of hay and cheerios cereal, possibly even a faint licorice aroma. Medium sweetness with very faint bitterness, banana taste really sticks out. A very good beer.
"
1," Bottle shared by Eric. Now Ive had plenty of Sake when I lived in Japan, but I never really liked it much- or at least not as much as beer. But I am branching out, and this quality brew was very nice. Pours a crystal clear color. The aroma and the flavor were dominated by sweet apples and pear. It was very oily and flavorful. Quite nice. Very warm as Sake tends to be. I am really not qualified to rate a Sake, but I will re-rate all of my early tries later when I hopefully know more.
"
1," A pricey, strong tasting beer that no beer-lover can live without trying. Best of the Chimay brews. Deep brown color with a very apparent alcoholic flavor. Sticks with your mouth, but not an bad after taste. Rich in many ways.
"
1," On tap.  Better than average for an IPA.  Has nice blend of malty body and hops finish.
"
1," Courtesy of Degarth. Pours deep darkness with nice mocha head. The aroma is dark roasted malts, burnt malts, licorice, chocolate malts and a hint of toffee. The taste is fairly rich albeit a bit thin with roasted and burnt malts mixed with chocolate and licorice. I also get a pulse of oatmeal twang. The taste becomes more and more roasty and burnt into the finish. It has a full flavor that has a dry oatmeal twang to it.
"
1," MAY 22, 2006 re-rate on cask at Noog 2006.  Appearance was gorgeous.  My first cask anything and i had heard it would be flat and warm, and it was not.  it gave this beer an amazing appearance of completely opaque orange with very thick full almost nitrous like head.  aroma was perfume and pine, lots of floral aroma to it.  flavor was very smooth and had some grapefruit, cirtus, some pine, and the same floral profile to it.  verygood malty flavors.  i enjoyed this a lot more than off the cask.
"
1," Sample at the Broad Ripple area brewpub.  A nice porter.  Appearance was pretty much like a porter.  Flavor was molasses, coffee, some chocolate, a hint of smoke.  Fairly sweet with molasses leading the way.  Some hops underneath.
"
1," The bottle looks good, but is very complex. Not easy to find the brewer. Aroma very sourish. Flavor the same. Very sourish and fermented. Nasty. Not a good beer.
"
1," JAN 10, 2008 Bottle, 33 cl. (also tasted from 75 cl and magnumbottle 1,5 l.)	This must be heaven ! Color, aroma, taste, were excellent. An incredible beer I would highly recommend.	But personally i take the Chimay White before the blue.
"
1," Draught at RB Charlotte.  Nearly opaque dark brown with thin light cocoa heads.  Fairly sweet chocolatey with little roast character.Finishes with a mildroast malt dryness and is fairly thin.
"
1," Bottle.  Poured a dark brown with a creamy, light tan (1 cm) head that persisted.  Aroma of Belgian yeast, light fruits, and as it warmed, dark fruits (raisin, prune).  Initial taste of sweet light fruit (apple, pear, melon) and slight bitterness in the swallow.  Also an aftertaste of smoked beef (odd, I know).  A lighter version of the Bleu.  Drinkable and tasty.

1," Like I can think of anything new to say about this beer there must be a thousand ratings of this classic. Heck this is just a classic strong abbey ale and I like it a lot despite the price having gone up on me
"
1," Creamy white head that lasts to the bottom of the glass.  Rich amber colour.  Huge pine and grapefruit/citrus hop aroma.  Flavour is also very hoppy but with enough toffee malt character to balance it out.  Lingering bitterness.  I enjoyed this one a great deal.
"
1," Clear yellow and fizzy lager, slightly acidic. Possibily a spoiled bottle. I not sure about the style.
"
1," 50 cL bottle. Pours hazy orange with a slowly diminished off-white head. Mild spiced aroma with a distinct hoppy note and mild malty sweetness joine with a nice yeasty note. Light spiced and medium sweet flavoured with a nice yeasty mellowness. Smooth yeasty and malty finish.
"
1," sample @ pub, thin chocolaty border boring black beer serve on nitro the beer as an excellent head I would to see a little more body + roastiness there
"
1," A great strong ale, but forgive me for not shamelessly fawning over it. Its a treat to drink this once in a while but thank Baccus there are lighter beers. This is another beer that can have its young character changed slightly by cellaring for a year or more but it would never get to be that old in my cellar ;-)		Poured a dark slightly clouded amber with a smallish off white cap. Aromas of dates or figs or dried apricots. Started with a surprising big mouthful of sweet bready malts before the expected complex/layered banana-fig-hop undertones took over. As the beer sits on the palate the hop accent builds until the finish is surprisingly dry for a so called trappist ale.		A very delightful strong ale but this is the 3rd time Ive tasted it and it has appeared slightly different each time. This may be a matter of ingredient linearity or it could be the brewers equivilent to a ""vintage"" where there is some batch to batch character differences. All in all, a wonderful drink but may be over rated by some.
"
1," DEC 12, 2008 Southern sweet tea appearance, Thick but light and frizzy head. Nose of moldy cheese, apple and wine. Taste as same as the nose, with a nice finish. Very unique taste that only a good Belgian can offer. 		Rerate"
1," DEC 19, 2004 Black, dark and opaque color. Creamy foam, much supporter and of long persistence. Much elegant one. Intense, strong aroma. Elevated alcoholic rate that not hung and be out of place not being the beer a lot balanced and full bodied. Dense and warm. Indeed excellent.
"
1," A superb beer, I had this in the 330ml version. Very odd to drink a beer with such a high percentage and it not feel like it was so strong, 9% and I could have drunk bottles of this all day. Unfortunately 2.65 a bottle, when Ive had Red for 1.99, still when you want to try a good beer youve got to pay.
"
1," 12oz, white waxed, bottle acquired in trade with shawnm213 (thanks!). Poured a deeper mahogany color with a smaller sized tan head. Aromas of caramel, dark fruitiness, chocolate, and some molasses. Tastes of dark fruits, chocolate, caramel, and some brown sugary sweetness. Alcohol content well hidden.
"
1," On tap at the Seven Bridges brewpub in Jacksonville, FL.  Arrived at the table black with a luscious tan head that lasted through mid-glass and left partial lace.  Mild aroma of roasted malt.  The flavor is roasted malt with some light bitterness towards the finish.  A little light-bodied and thin, more like a porter than a stout.
"
1," Nice IPA I got from my Secret Santa. Thanks man! Aroma was kind of weak but what was there was all hops. Pour was a beautiful dark burnt orange with a nice 1 finger off white head. Taste was mostly citrus hops with a little malt in the background, but this is definately a hops oriented IPA. Not too strong or overbearing however, just a good sessionable IPA which is rare nowadays.
"
1," Dark brown with a thick white head.  Hoppy smell with a subtle nut malt undertone to it.  Sweet nutty taste but very fruity tastes to it and a yeasty taste to it.  Belly warming fruity aftertaste, real good but not my preferred style of beer fruit tastes general dont appeal to me, making me not a big Belgium beer drinker.
"
1," Bottle 500ml. @ home.Clear medium to dark orange amber color with a average to large, frothy to creamy, good lacing, mostly lasting, off-white head. Aroma is moderate to light heavy malty, roasted, caramel, nutty, keller, earth. Flavor is moderate sweet and bitter with a average to long duration. Body is medium, texture is oily to watery, carbonation is soft. [20091226]
"
1," OCT 15, 2010 Pours a orange color, slightly hazy, topped with a thick off-white foamy head. Slightly creamy head. The aroma is fruity banana with some yeast and vanilla. The flavor is citrusy with lots of mixed fruit; banana, grapefruit, and orange. Somewhat of a tart sour presence.  Yeasty notes are there. Overall this is quite solid with a good amount of flavor while being even quite refreshing.
"
1," mohagany appearance with slight white head.  nose is sweet as is the taste with fig and sweet plums.  a nice dubble, the archetype but markedly better than all others
"
1," Oen of the top beers Ive found. The apricot tinged little wonder is just tart enough, just sharp enough, and just pleasant enough for ""anytime"" drinking.
"
1," This is an excellent experience but I felt the alcohol overtones to great to place it in the top choices.  I admit to a preference to the dubbel, I think this is a great beer to educate the pallet.
"
1," Bottle as Flat Top.  Pour is a blond with a small white head.  Aroma is some light wheat and yeast nothing much.  Flavor is about the same some yeast that made this creamy but nothing really else.  Overall very light and forgetable.
"
1," A really beautiful ale.  It dark and has a red hue when held to the light.  It has a slight aroma of malt and yeast.  The flavor is the same except lots of carbonation and a tangy flavor I dont recognize.  Very good.
"
1," Bottle, 0.33l. Dark red brown, with light brown creamy head . Aroma, red fruit, brown sugar and malt. Taste raisins, malt, dried cherry with caramel finish. Very nice complex beer.
"
1," Pours a deep ruby red to brownish sort of color with a creamy off white head.  Nose is spicy, and you can detect light amounts of alcohol, and maybe a tiny bit of roastiness.  It has a nice malt backing and is a little bit bitter upfront with some light fruit flavors.  Finish is very sweet and just a tiny little bit spicy.  Very thick and creamy in the mouth with nice low carbonation.
"
1," (12oz bottle thanks to bu11zeye) clear rich amber with lasting tan bubbles. Nose of honey, chlorine, juicy sweet citrus and cracker. Taste of rye, spicy, rhubarb, honey and quite sweet. Oily body with a linger of rye.
"
1," From Bottle at Jacobys in Greek Town in Detroit. Wolderfuly complex flavors of nuts, yeast and hints of malt. Murky brown color, you can feel the alcohol going down. A great beer to warm up with.
"
1," Cask gravity at Reading BF 06. Deep gold/amber colour. Diacetyl and a bit of a chemical aroma. Not nice. I remeber this stayed on the table for some time.
"
1," caramel, cereal, coffee, coffee brown, full body, 	Bottled. A must. It smells and tastes torrefaction with a really good  dosage. The ratio quality/availability is the better
"
1," I was surprised at how enjoyable this beer is.  The Bleu is more complex, and quite possibly a more interesting beer to study.  I had this with a salad at the end of a very long day and found it delightful.  Nose is a classic European hop, floral and bitter, and some malt.  Appearance is cloudy, reddish copper, small head, white lace.  Taste is fruit, spice (banana and clove?  they say apricot, but I just did not get apricot!), and classic European hoppiness.  Good big mouthfeel.  Nice, solid, bitter finish.  Delightful.  I was surprised that I liked this more than the more famous and more highly regarded Bleu and Blanche.
"
1," Honestly,  I dont understand what all the hype is about.  This kind of disappointed me.  It had a nice appearance, very perfect brown color with impressive sandy colored head.  Aroma was yeasty, peachy, some purple grapes, some weird lemon pepper scent too.  Flavor was carbonated, brown sugar, green apple, wheat bread, yeast, and some malt.  meh... it really was kind of plain and i was stretching for some of these flavors and aromas.
"
1," Bottled. A dark golden beer with a lazing off-white head. The aroma has notes of straw, honey, and malt. The flavor is sweet with notes of straw, malt, and caramel, leading to a bitter finish.
"
1," on tap at brewpub. deep golden, decent head, some retention and lacing. herbal hop and faint malts aroma. little to no hops in taste - light herbal citrusy. average carbonation, light body.
"
1," Wonderful conditioning on this bottle, picked up at Crown in Carmel, IN. Deep and rich brown, nearly black in color, with a fine bubbled lasting head. Dry, leathery, funky aroma, with sweet bourbon components. Taste is a bit sweet with bourbon, carmelized sugars and woodsiness. Somewhat smoky flavors too. There is a little watery hole in the palate.Good, especially the aroma. Update - 10 mins later...WOW, the wood is strong here; very drying, very intense. Delicious, if a bit overdone...

1," Enjoyed on tap at the brewpub with the brewer. This one came in at 10%, a little less boozy than last year i am told. Better than the oaked version I am told. A little head, still boozy but not in aroma. Smooth, caramel, Otter. Peachy fruity. Not too hoppy, not a big American barleywine but he may do one like that.
"
1," Bottle. A beutiful dark brown color. It has a light aroma of fruit and a good head. It has a slight aroma of hop bitternes. It is very drinkable but somewhat boring. If I could choose between this and Chimay Blue I would never drink Chimay Red.
"
1," Bottle 33cl.	2008. Pours a muddy brown colour with a good head.	Clear fruity arome, very complex and well balanced.	Taste is also very fruity, goes down with a touch of the alcohol.	Very good beer.
"
1," My hundredth beer. Dark reddish brown beer, nice brown head, nearly no lacing. Malty aroma, dark fruits, alcohol, a slight hint of coriander, sugar, yeast. Bitter initial taste, more malty finish. Spicy tones. By far the best of the 3 commercial Chimay beers.
"
1," Bottle. Pours an unclear red/brown colour with a longlasting white head. Sweet malty wheat aroma with some hints of yeast and hints of clove. Sweet malty alcohol flavor with some hints of yeast and caramel. Also some hints of clove. Sweet malty warming finish with some bitterness.
"
1," Bottled.  Clear pale golden, rich creamy head. Buttery soft malt. Fairly sweet with grainy malt and slight salty bitterness.
"
1," DEC 11, 2006 The first Belgian beer I ever had.  First had in summer of 2004.  Dark brown color, with a nice head.  Overall color was appealing.  Fruit smell was strongest, but also aromas of malt and hops.  Despite the high alcohol, the flavor was drinkable and well balanced.  Flavor was sweet, malty fruity, and spicy.  Great blend of flavors.  One of my favorites..
"
1," I just absolutely love this one.  The fruity aroma with the hefty flavor makes Chimay a true delicacy. I still perfer the white, but I wont turn this down.
"
1," JAN 4, 2010 Bottle. Mahogany, red-brown at the edges with a fine tan slick. Nose; Flemish-like blackcurrant, iron, balsamic and caramel splashes +TCP, roots, bitter herbs, leather, some rauch-type waxiness- complex and weird. Strange ashy, herbal flavour riddled with ink and spoiling antiseptic notes (TCP). Suspect something has gone wrong here. Difficult beer approaching the plughole.
"
1," Mild wood, walnut and hop aroma. Hazy chestnut brown. Wood and citrus dry-hopped flavor. Finish has a long half-life.
"
1," Tasting notes from 2003 Harbury beer festival.  Golden amber with thin head.  Earthy metallic aroma.  Dry bland flavours with some fruit notes, but fairly boring.  Malt lingering finish.
"
1," SEP 22, 2005 Good beer. A bit to smokey for my taste. A little too much like beef jerky. Enjoyable and interesting but not as good as the blue.
"
1," Cloudy brown orange, pours a heavy head that quickly fades. Burnt coffee in the taste, smoky creamy; finish is sweet.
"
1," SEP 3, 2008 Bottle thanks to Acknud!!!  Black beer nice dark brown head.  Smells of coffee.  Beer has a nice mouthfeel with some good stout tones, but finish tastes like the old coffee grounds that you throw away once you are done brewing coffee.  Just too bitter and strong old coffee flavor.  Even so it is pretty decent.
"
1," NOV 19, 2006 Anyone rating this beer highly must be drinking a very old vintage as the malt extract and hop oil used nowadays give it a very different, almost unrecognisable taste compared to an 87 or 88. Maybe they still brew it with proper ingredients for export to the US as that country appears to be where most of the rave reviews come from.
"
1," cask at cloisters ... dark amber ... thin lacing ... sweet toffee malt ... juicy malts ... sweet fruits ... boring but sweet
"
1," bottle thanks to bu11zeye.  poured amber with a cream head.  nose is fresh grass, hops, faint citrus, and very floral.  nice on the palate, flavor is smooth citrus hops and grass.
"
1," MAR 4, 2011 Chimay Blue on punertava ja ruskea, sakea olut.  Aromi ja maku ovat molemmat tumman hedelmisi, hiivaisia, rusinaisia ja mausteisia. Hyv perusbelgi. Tekee juuri sen, mit pitkin.
"
1," ive decided this is not style of beer.  too much carbonation, and not enough taste to fill the beer quota.  fruity with a fizzy head. similar to the lambics but less fruit, and more spices.  not enough here to make me a fan by any means.
"
1," 0.5 l bottle, thanks Timo A! Golden color with small head. Sweetish, malty, honeyish and slightly toasty aroma. Malty and honeyish flavor with some tart fruitiness and some bready-toasty notes in the background. Very ordinary.
"
1," Pours with a nice big head that fizzes away into a smallish but tight head. The color is a very dark hazy brown. Aroma is yeasty and nutty with some deep malty sweet notes and some plum like fruitiness. Flavor is very good, the malty sweetness is very present here but its not cloying, this is one of those where the alcohol seems to balance the sweetness, which I always find is either brilliant or a total disaster, more often its the latter of those two but in the case of this beer it is brilliant. Fruity notes of cherry, apple, and pear are present and work well alongside a good nuttiness.
"
1," This draft brew from the brewery poured a small sized head of foamy brown colored fully diminished bubbles that left behind an opaque dark black colored body with no visible carbonation.  It had a mild tingly start to the mouth feel and a medium tingly finish with a mild coffee aftertaste.  There was a certain smoothness to the palate.  The flavor was mixed with coffee dark roasted malt toasted dark malt and more coffee flavor.  The aroma was a mild coffee dark malty one too.
"
1," Bottle thanks to thirdeye11.  The look is brown to black in color with an off white head.  The smell is coffee, malts, alcohol, and bourbon.  The taste is coffee, bourbon, malts, chocolate, and good.
"
1," MAR 12, 2006 Poured from the botte at The Jolly Gardeners (Putney, London), a reddish brown with a creamy head. A fruity aroma with hints of strawberries and banana. A sweetish flavour with fruit coming through again (tangy pear). Initially smooth in the mouth with a nice natural carbonation and a tangy sour aftertaste.
"
1," Nose is yeasty, lemony, dark fruits and some alcohol.  Flavor is plum, tart lemon, oak, peach, dry fruityness, alcohol.  Spicy finish.
"
1," Cask, Blackfriars, Inverness.  Certainly warms you up on a Scottish winter night!  A good strong Scottish ale with a good amount of hops and full-on flavour.
"
1," The pils is nicely malty with a bit of sweetness to accentuate it.  There is just enough diacetyl to be not unpleasant, along with a medium hop bitterness that balances nicely with the light malty sweetness.  There is also quite a bit of fruitiness to the pils, which seems a bit out of place in lager.  In talks with the owner I have found out the likely culprit of this ale like taste, apparently the lagering phase is only 10 days, and the diacetyl helps to confuse the matter.
"
1," 750ml bottle. Reddish brown in colour with a small off white head that dissipates quickly. Aromas of fruits(plums, grapes), malt, yeast and bread. Flavor is moderately sweet with notes of plum and caramel, with a mild flavor of alcohol coming through in the end. Finishes dry with almost no bitterness. Very lively carbonation, almost rivaling that of canned pop. I look forward to trying the rest of the chimay lineup.
"
1," Draft at Disneyworld. Not a bad brown ale.  Nice caramel and slightly chocolaty flavor.
"
1," Dark brown if not black in color,small tan head that had some staying power.malty sweet aroma with a spicy citrus note to it.malty taste with a definate spiciness and fruit tone.the after taste is fruity and hoppy with a nice spice to it as well.The feel is some what thick maybe even a slight syrupy texture.I don't know,i've always had a problem drinking the brews from these guys without having to force myself to swallow.Theres just something about this brewery's beer that is hard for me to take.
"
0," Cask@Twickenham Beer festival. Thanks to Steve behind the bar for the heads up on this beer. Thankfully i didnt end up buying a half pint. this was absolutely awful. Cosmetic boot polish and boiled vegetable. I hope to god something was wrong with this, because (pardon my French), it tasted like shit.
"
1," 33 cL bottle. Pours clear and yellow with a small white head. Dry cornish and bitterhops aroma. Sweet caramel malt flavoured with a light bitterness showing through. Goes into a classic bitter and somewhat cornish finish.
"
1," Mmmm... a wonderful Belgian Strong Ale... my favorite Chimay, and one of my fave Belgian. The subtle, complex flavor belies the high Alc. content. As refined as beer gets!!
"
1," 2005 Bottle, 33cl.  Dark brown pour with medium head.  Clean fruity aroma.  A malty hops flavor.
"
1," JAN 17, 2008 Excellent ale. Beautiful and aromatic. Smooth and silky on the tongue with a pleasant alcohol warmth. Seems to me that you can sense the cask a bit in the aftertaste, which adds something. Absolutely wonderful. A favorite.
"
1," Appearance is orangish with no head. Good lace with a light hop nose and flavor of hops with very light maltiness. Dry and bitter finish.
"
1," Pours amber/copper, aroma is sweet with fruity notes.  Refreshing light taste, with just a touch of bitterness.
"
1," Pint at the brewpub.  Dark copper with heavy hops on the nose.  Nice hop bite in the flavor with a fairly short clean finish.  Decent I.P.A.  	P.S. One of my favorite movies!
"
1," Tasted on tap at brewpub. This IPA pours a copper gold color. Small sized white foamy head. Aroma is floral and citrusy. A medium bodied IPA. Malts are fruity and sweet, touch of bread. Hops are grapefruity and floral. Nice balance. Nice hop finish. Crisp and clean. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. <BR ...><BR ...>	Cask Version 		Tasted on cask at brewpub. Pumps a deep orange gold color. Very large sized long lasting white foamy head. Aroma is malty and fruity, with a strong floral hop note. A medium bodied IPA. Malts are earthy and floral, touch of citrus at the front. As usual for a cask beer, it has a full, round and creamy mouthfeel. Touch of wood. Smooth taste. More in the English style of IPA, taste is more earthy and floral than hoppy. Good session IPA. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.
"
1," I dont like IPAs, but I know what it supposed to be, and this is a good IPA.  A slight dyactel or oily flavor, but it wasnt too bad.  If you like IPA, you will like this beer.
"
1," (Dutch ratebeer meeting) Skunky smell. Pie coloured with no head. Sweet, artificial taste. Watery and thin palate.
"
1," Orangish appearance medium head. Flavor was malty but very good. Shag is right though the people walking above us were quite annoying and it was hard to concentrate!
"
1," On draught at brewpub. Amber-brown pour with a thick sudsy head that leaves thick lace. The nose is of caramel, pale malt and English bitters.  Flavors are much the same, with some caramel, melon, lightly metallic notes hitting mid-pull, and ends with some tea tannins and a crisp bitter finish.  Its very reminiscent of an ESB in the body; thinner and showing some skins/tannins in the mouth, but it does have substance on the palate, without being overtly complex. Makes for an easy summer quaff. Light and refreshing.
"
1," Sensational, the best Beer ive tasted so far, brilliant
"
1," A heftly bottle of this was my introduction to Beerpagne.  This brew pours a dark murky	hazel caramel.  The large frothy mostly diminishing head is off-white with virtually no	lacing.  The moderate nose is a complex mix of moderate grain, hay, caramel, grass, resin,	citrus, earth, raisin, vanilla, cola, and alcohol.  The flavor is balanced with a light start	featuring sweetness acidity, and bitterness.  The long finish is also balanced with	everything from the start being moderate with an addition of vanilla, caramel, anise,	pepper, and lemon/lime citrus tones.  The palate is the only glaring weak point in my	opinion.  The body is light to medium, the texture is dry, and the finish has a strong	astringency combined with a metallic texture.  The problem for me here is the excessive	carbonation that I can only compare to cheap champagne.  It really ruined the experience	for me.  A good brew that would be beyond stellar if the bubbles would be halved.
"
1," Clear amber colour with a thin white head. Tangy carmel malt nose. Sweet carmel malt taste with dry fruity finish with underlying carmel malt.
"
1," Looks like they brought back an old one. 4oz draft sample at the brewpub. Color is slightly cloudy straw gold. Aroma is spices and cloves. Taste is over spiced cloves and banana with that belgian yeast flavor. Rather typical belgian wheat, IMO, but the spices and clove were a little strong for me. Fine beer, nothing spectacular.
"
1," This beer was tried on July 27, 2007 at the Beer Bistro in Toronto.  The beer poured a deep dark brown into the Chimay glass with a generous off-white head that didnt last near as long as some other Trappists Ive tried.  The aroma is full of malt and yeast, with a tinge of sweetness.  The mouthfeel was full-bodied with a champagne like carbonation feel.  The flavour was a combination of malts and fruits.  A very good beer.
"
1," Orange color, with what Ive come to expect as the standard Barley Island monster head. Kind of a dank citrusy aroma. Some citrusy flavors with a dry finish. Might be an old bottle, but Im not getting any ""pronounced"" hop flavor.
"
1," As Chattanooga Steamer.  Dark brownish, yellow.  Foamy white head.  Aroma is sweet, malty, light corn and spiciness.  Taste is biting malt spiciness, light grassy bitter.
"
1,Sniffer
1," Still clear opalescent pear skin yellow. Still. Rather dry yellow apple skin aroma. Liquorous and skinny. Medium bodied. Woody and earthy notes in a long, dry white wine astringent finish. Good, but easily forgettable cider.
"
1," Copper pour with enormous (and irritatingly long-lived) rocky head.   Some floral hopping, but mainly citrusy notes to cut through the caramel/toffee base.  Nicely done and yes, I agree, sessionable.
"
1," 12 oz bottle conditioned bottle. Pours a dark amber with a cream/off white head that sticks around. Aroma is a yeasty sweetness, a touch of malt and spice. Flavor is a little bit of spice, with a bit of malt character, then a slight hop finish. An almost vanilla-toffee flavor before a slight alcohol feel as well.
"
1," Pours a reddish brown color with a towering head that sticks around for the long run. This looks highly effervescent with swarms of lively bubbles racing up. The aroma is complex consisting of dark fruits such as raisins, black cherry, and figs. Belgian yeast, black pepper, clove, and alcohol also share time in the nose. The flavor is led by an overarching peppery spice that is pulled in by high carbonation. Mixing in are dark fruits, cherry, molasses, and hints of rum. Sugary sweetness slides in toward the back, with an alcohol warmth to remind you of its strenght. The body is medium with a zippy carbonation.
"
1," A great beer with a dark redcopper color and a nice appearance. Fine caramel sweet smell with notes from dried plums and lightly roasted malts. The taste is rich and fresh,with a round body and a noble sweetness.The afthertaste is bittersweet with a nice ending.
"
1," Vintage 2002. Cost me a heap, and I haven't got the ideal glass to drink out of, but we'll see if it turns out good.	Again with the strong red wine alcohol kind of aroma. A few berrish hints in there too. Pours a very dark brown, almost black, thick with sediment, with a nice little fluffy tanish head. Alcohol? What alcohol? Real smooth, like silk. So complex with flavour. Mainly dark kind of fruits, blackberrys, plum, red grapes, with a really nice smokey flavour. That's how I could describe it. Leaves not a bitter hint in the mouth, but a refreshing clean alcohol refreshness, not a bad thing though. Beats pretty much any red wine, and beer for that matter i've had, to date. Truely an awesome drop!
"
1," The best of the Chimay line. Enjoyed this in the evening as a dessert and easy to drink more than one, but be careful, they add up quickly.
"
1," Pretty good stout, but nothing extraordinary - I was impressed that the waitress was able to distinguish it as a sweet stout rather than a dry stout ""...like Guinness..."" - its nice to have knowledgeable wait-staff in a brewpub.
"
1," A DARK BEER. A STRONG TASTE OF RUM,RAISIN AND PLUM.CARAMEL MALTY SUGAR ROASTED AND SYRUPY. RESPECTABLE IF YOU REALLY LIKE BEER. WONDERFUL IF YOU APPRECIATE THE BELGIAN STYLE.
"
1," dark reddish amber in colr.  nice hop bouquet with floral undertones.  the hops linger for quite a  bit.  the best beer of the night but thats not saying much.  thats why i think im rating it pretty high
"
1," A vigorous pour from the can into my Lost Abbey Teku glass produces a two-finger thick, amber tinged, tan colored head.  The beer is a dark amber color that shows a brilliantly clear, copper-amber hue when held up to the light.  The aroma smells of citrusy Cascade like-hops backed up by sweet-tea like crystal malt.  The hop character is definitely dominant and has a touch of resinous character to it, but it really reminds me of ruby-red grapefruit juice and zest more than anything.		Fairly sweet tasting up front, with softer hop character than was in the aroma, but the finish takes a wrong turn some where and reminds me of stewed, oxidized crystal malt in a not so pleasant way; my second sip has this morphing into a dirty dish water like flavor that is backed by a piney, bitter hop note.  At the front of the tongue the hop character contributes a citrusy, grapefruit like and orange zest flavor along with some resinous pine and herbal hop notes.  The beer has a pretty good texture for this type of beer; if it wasnt for the off flavor in the finish, this would be quite quaffable with its medium light body.		Certainly an interesting beer, at times the dirty flavors towards the finish seem to disappear (but mostly it is way to distracting), but I cant say that I really like the heavier crystal malt direction.  In the end though the flavor can almost seems gross; it really does remind me of dirty dishwater, it is a shame as there might be a half-way decent beer here otherwise.
"
1," Its warm golden with a creamy, white head, and the aroma has notes of malt,bread and light fruit. The flavour has a light sweetness and notes of malt, bread, biscuit and light fruit. Its soft and very pleasant.
"
1," Kind thanks both to Bierkrug an Pivnizub for both giving me a bottle of  Hrte 10. Hazy amber, fine carbonation, offwhite layer. light phenolic green apple and pear aroma. Heavy honeyish start, turpentine in hiding, orange peel, a bit underattenuated or at least heavy in the rest sugar. Creamy mouthfeel, not quite sticky.Feels unfinished, Ill cellar bottle nr 2 and see how it develops.
"
1," Apricot hint is very unusual. Beautiful color. This ale is a must try for anyone.
"
1," Delicious. Strong and sweet and flavorful. Worth its reputation. I a big fan of this. Very good beer.
"
1," HUGE head. but thats about it. this was one of those beers that i had such high expectations for (from reading reviews like these at ratebeer) and was just a tad disappointed.		granted, it was one single of the big bottles, maybe a bad batch? but nothing special, imho.		all i know is that i seem to be getting better tasting belgian beers from the microbreweries here in the USA than i am finding from belgium itself.		freshness issue?? 		hype?
"
1," What's not to like about this.  The aroma is outstanding, the appearance is great.  The flavor and texture are so smooth, that its hard not to like.
"
1," Pours dark reddish in color.  A very nice color.  No head or lacing to speak of.  The aroma consists of spices, dark fruits and candied sugar.	Taste is dark fruit, and is high in carbonation.  I prefer my belgians a lot less carbonated.  This is a well made easy drinking, good beer.  Cant wait to actually put one down for awhile and see what some time does for it.
"
1," Bottle, 33cl. Murky brown with long lasting head. Fruity malt nose, typical dubbel. Enjoyed this very much.
"
1," Pretty golden yellow with a thin head out of the tap at a festival.  Harsh grainy taste with raw hop juice finish.  Not well blended, balanced or interesting.  I'll have to try it again to see if it is better.
"
1," APR 29, 2003 POurs with a red-brown/mohagony body topped by a thick foamy head with a good amount of lace left behind.  Slightly sweet and fruity aroma with an underlying spicyness and a woody character.  Slightly sweet and fruity malt flavor with a spicy yeasty background.  Full bodied and tingling on the tongue.
"
1," A very good beer. Smooth, full flavor and body. Nice finish. Goes down very easy.
"
1," Bottle.  Pours a dark amber color with an extremely large, frothy white head.  Lacing is very strong.  Aromas of bananas, grapefruit, and roasted malts.  Lively palate with a very nice creamy finish, Flavors of bananas and fruit with a finish of malts.  Very good beer.
"
1," Musty, woody aroma with floral notes.  Flavor of yeast, must, cobwebs.  Not as bad as the description makes it sound, just not nearly as good as Chimay Blue.
"
1," Light amber in color with a hoppy aroma. Fairly bitter taste with light hop aroma for an IPA.
"
1, Hazy dark with a small head. Extensive lacing.		Aroma 
1," This time from a 330ml brown bottle bought at the SAQ (I also drank the 750ml Premire version) Copper with a beige head in appearence, no head retention. A bit hazy, some sediment in the bottle. Spicy on the nose with some yeast. This beer is complex with some nice spices,good malt. Easy drinking for 7,0% alc. I love this beer.
"
1," Coarse, bubbly head.  Highly carbonated and slightly cloudy.  Amber.  Clove rpesent in aroma and flavor.  Slightly woody.
"
1," Bottle 50 cl. Courtesy of fonefan. Pours a cloudy golden with a dense white head. Sweet banana and yeast aroma. Medium body, very smooth mouthfeel, banana, a little butter and some yeast and vitamins. 151010
"
1," Pours a black color with brown highlights. Pleasant flavor of roasted malt and oatmeal. Good flavor of oatmeal and roasted malt. The body is medium with a creamy texture and moderate carbonation. A very pleasant stout.
"
1," There were floaters in the middle of the large bottle and noticeable sediment on the bottom.  It poured a big off while head with popping bubbles.  It was mostly diminishing.  At first the color in a full glass reminded me of plum wine, but slightly lighter and with a little orange.  Small bubbles rose from the bottom of the glass.  Initially, it felt lively on the tongue and released a flavor that is hard for me to describe.  After a short bit the liveliness died down allowing it to become smooth all the way through.  It had a nice full round mouth feel that was clean after the swallow.  The flavors started with what reminded me of warm doughy bread with a hint if nuts.  It ended with a pleasurable metallic astringency, which lightly remained in the after taste.  If drank quickly it has a sharp harshness that quickly builds up.  It is a very good beer that I will have again.  The reason for the lower aroma rating is because I have not been very successful in telling the difference between beers for a while.
"
1," The beer in the glass is bright ruby red, with a fine head. Simply gorgeous! Strong malty and roasty bitter aroma, very spicy. Starts with solid malt body, coupled with a pleasant sweetness and some caramel and roasted malts. The aftertaste is rather sweet as roasty, with wonderful caramel flavors. The further course is well hopped and bitter, roasted malt also increases enormously. Goes into  a sweet caramelly, strong malty finish! Outstanding Bockbier with voluminous aromas!
"
1," Still brings awe as the best >4 do but the dearth of a stronger body and persistence is evident in the 2004 vintage. This used to be the best beer Id ever tasted and although I still drink it, I do hope future samples to improve.
"
1," The number 3 on my favorites list. Sweet, very alcoholic and a good aftertaste, asks for more after a first. Should be drunk at the right temperature however.
"
1," MAY 28, 2011 28-05-11 New bottle, follow up on previous rating	Much better. Guess my previous bottle was a fluke. Good malts and yeast nose. Flavour is sweet, dried plums, cardemom and different other sweetish spices.	Original ratingVery, very enthousiastic. Half of it pours out of the bottle upon opening, before I can get it over the glass, which wasnt more than 50cm away. Alcoholic aroma, some liquorice, bit metallic. Flavour alcoholic, no real depth. Is this a fluke bottle? BestBefore is 2015, so it cant be more than a year old. Will taste it again soon to see.	(From 0,33L bottle)
"
1," pours a cloudy medium brown with fizzy fine beige head.	very fruity, and kinda effervescent aroma, its got lemon rind, dried apricot, overripe bananas, cloves, and dark bread.	similar flavor, a bit on the mild side, with yeast, dark fruit, 	slightly thin body doesnt match flavor all that well, but it has a great dry finish.
"
1," bottle. Cloudy pale yellow, large and creamy white head. Wheaty and yeasty, pleasantly fruity but not too much banana. Very well balanced Hefeweizen, I enjoyed it very much.
"
1," 330ml bottle. Hazy copper to rown colour with a tan head that quickly fades. Aromas of spiced fruit and christmas pudding. Thick taste that leaves an impression on the tongue.
"
1," Bottle (Beers of Summer at OTH). Pours cloudy red/tan with an off-white head. Aroma is nice hoppiness and grapefruit. Flavor is burnt hops and tons of citrus accent. Light/medium mouthfeel.
"
1," Beer of the month club, pours golden with a nice white head aroma seems sour, like vinegar, fruit and malt, flavor is sour with flavor of cauliflower, this one is probably infected, light bodied, should taste it again.
"
1," Root beer colored pour with a spritzy, cola head that instantly disappears.  Toffee, caramel and alcohol in the nose.  Syrupy sweet body is fruity and figgy with notes of dark chocolate.  A bit more thin that I would have expected.  Warming alcohol sensation in the finish.  Nice, but I thought the White was better.
"
1," Draught) Pours a clear golden body with a small white head. Nearly nonexistent aroma; light butter and grain. Flavor of malt with slightly skunky hops.
"
1," Pours an oak red color with and nice thick off white head.  Aroma of roasted malt and brown sugars.  Flavors of roasted malts with sweet dark fruits, caramels, spices and with a sweet bitterness and sry finish.  Such a warm and pleasant beer.
"
1," Dark brown color.  A lot of flavors happening at once.  Dried fruit mixed with a malty, sweetness,  and a slight alcoholic kick to finish.  A superb ale. I enjoyed this very much
"
1," Yeasty, baked bread-like nose with a wonderfully smooth, rounded mouthfeel.   Thick off-white head, somewhat malty sweet body.   My nose is a little stuffed up at the moment so I did not get any of the fruity aromas.   Crisp, drying finish.   Nice stuff, like a meal in a bottle.
"
1," FEB 4, 2004 Pours very cloudy ruby with a moderate head.  Very strong lace.  Aroma is very malty withapticots and a little smoke.  Flavor is similar.  Fruity without too much sweetness.  Slightly bitter finish with a dry aftertaste.  The alcohol is not very noticable in the flavor, but you can feel it later.  Thinner than the blue.  Lots of carbonation.  A very nice mild Belgian dubbel.
"
1," he last Chimay for me to try is also my favorite of the three styles ..yes yes I know a Quad is technically a bigger Dubbel, bear with me.		Pour is a very murky brown with some floaties and a nice eggshell white head that gets pretty big bud also disappointingly dies down rather quickly.		Smell is great, bread and some light spice and malty goodness, no sign of hops.		Taste is surprisngly bold, mimicking the characteristics of nose with a bit more prominent spice. This is going to rank in front of the White but behind the Blue as far as my taste is concerned.		As with most Belgians, the mouth is refined to a point where you almost take it for granted. Relatively thin and bubbly, where it needs to be.		A fairly easy drinker for a relatively big beer, and definitely a good and slightly cheaper alternative to its bigger brother, but for me anyway it doesnt hang with some of the better dubbels around such as St. Bernarduss 8 and of course the King, Westy 8.
"
1," 33cl. Dark Amber color with a great aroma a very clean crisp spicy brew. The fruity aromas where wonderful this is a very good brew and would love to visit the acutal brewery one day.

1," pours red with thin khaki head, lots of carbonation.  aroma is sweet dark fruit. flavor is the same, warm, very carbonated, dry.
"
1," A great stout - jumps out at you with more hops than many stouts and a terrific flavor.  Great roasted malt and well balanced.  Ive had a few dozen of these at the source in Chattanooga which is a very cool brewery.  I would love to see this bottled!
"
1," 750 ml bottle @Kaisla. Pours reddish brown with tannish head. Toffee, plum and molasses-like notes in the aroma. The flavour also has some sweet molasses as well as caramel and maltiness. A hint of alcohol in the finish.
"
1," 0.33 l bottle.	It pours a hazy reddish brown/amber, a superb beige coloured head on its top (which remains like whipped cream).	Its nose is banana/dried fruity and spicy.	The tasteing begins with a sweetness, mouthfeels creamy and the flavour is fruity.	The middle is of caramell malt, the usual belgian yeast with some hints of citrus hops.	In the finish the moutfeels becoming thiner and it ends citric, spicy and dry.	The body is medium, textures light sticky.	A pretty good and pleasant belgian stuff, which is good drinkable at all.
"
1," Bomber from a long ago trade with STFun. Pours a deep reddish black with a thick tan head. Aroma was sweet vanilla, bourbon, and hints of chocolate malt. Sweet malt and chocolate taste with more hints of the vanilla and a touch of bourbon. Not a bad sweet stout.
"
1," 750 mL bottle.  Poured amber bown in a Chimay goblet with a low level of carbonation.  Sweet, fruity flavor dominated by plums and raisins.  Dissapointed but will resample soon.

1," NOV 20, 2003 i didn't drink this in the proper glass, so shoot me in the ass.  not as good as i expected.  faint yeasty, flowery aroma.  very carbonated.  the flavors are subtle.  initially bitter, followed by a faint sweet maltiness.  i expected more.  maybe my taste buds are tainted by all the damn cigarettes i smoke.  not worth the 10 bucks i paid.
"
1," Sort of a benchmark beer. Spicy, with a tantalizingly chewy body. Mellow but nuanced flavors.
"
1," Healthy, lively head that produces some wonderful lacing in the glass. Fruit, caramel and toffee in the aroma.  As it warms, the flavours change and meld into an unusual level of complexity upon the tongue.  Definately, drink this one at room temperature.  A classic.
"
1," Burnt orange in color...sweet, flowery, malty, dry. Many tastes blend in this fine trappist beer.
"
1," Bottle courtesy of blutt59.  Clouded brown red pour with a ridiculous amount of sediment. Sweet smell with a molasses type aroma. Feel is all in the back of the throat. Taste has some dry elements and a sweeter malt tingle. Spicy finish, almost a ginger feel.
"
1," Bought a gift pack tonight with the red,white and blue Chimay along with the big chimay glass for $10.99.	The blue poured almost black with a nice thick off white colored head.	Aroma if a bit fruity, a bit of malt, crisp.	Flavor is yeasty, roast nuts and has a strong bite at the finish that stays on the palate long after drinking.	Not bad at all..not great, but not bad.
"
1," Great for special occasions , not an everyday beer for me.This is a very strong, tasty beer, dark rich in flavour, very enjoyable.Very nice aftertaste leaves you licking your lips.

1," APR 14, 2006 Bottle Date"
1," NOV 27, 2006 Bottle chimay premiere 75 cl  of 1999. Gentlemen, what a year, and such a good beer. Poors a hazy brown beer with a minor head, and some pleasant lacing. Aromas of sweet malts are noticed. Flavors like plums, caramel, ending into sweetness, and fruitiness.
"
1," 750 mL bottle.  Pours a cloudy reddish brown with no head except for a thin ring around my snifter.  Aroma is malty and nutty with dried fruit, spice and yeast with a bit of sourness in the foreground.  Flavor is of doughy malt and sweet fruit (dried cherries, peaches, and plums) and spice (corriander and allspice).  There is a pleasant Bretty sourness found in this beer that I think helps balance and round it out.  I getting a bit of hop bitternes but next to no flavor so I assuming they are using old hops as is usual with the lambic brewers.  Also some tannins are evident in the dry finish.  Body is medium-full with a good bit of carbonation.  Great beer, better than Bleu I think.
"
1," Tiny bubbles! The hoppy nose is softened with age and has a cider like dryness. Say aged cheese.
"
1," Drank from a goblet. Dark orange, hazy, with sediment in it almost like a suspension liquid. Malty, roasted caramel with a slightly acidic, flowery tinge. (The first time I had this one, I swear I tasted eggnog in it, but not anytime since). 		I love the look of this beer in a glass, and I like the thickish mouthfeel.
"
1," Bottle. Pour sdeep amber with a white head. Aroma is malt, caramel and fruity hops. Taste is sweet with some caramel and fruityness.
"
1," The most complex tasting, most satisfying drink I have ever had.  Perfection.
"
1," Incredible, absolutely amazing taste. One of the best beers I have ever had.
"
1," On tap at the Taco Mac. This poured a dark amber color with an aroma of caramel and some citrus. The flavor was rather one dimensional but malty with hints of caramel. Overall an ok session beer but not much else.
"
1," Bottle # 26 at yesprs blindtasting. 	Hazy yellow coloured with no head.	Sweet aroma of caramel and spices with notes of yeast.	Sweet flavour of caramel and spices with notes of yeast.	Spicy finish.

1," dark malt, nuts, wood with some roastiness. Finishes very intense with flavours of alcohol,toffee and yeast. An enjoyable beer.
"
1," 12 oz. bottle courtesy of decaturstevo several months ago.  Finally getting around to entering some old ratings.  Pours a clear golden color with a one finger thick white head.  Very light spotty lacing.  Aroma is grain, herbal hops, and slight diacetyl.  Flavor is the same with some alcohol noticeable.  Light to medium body.  A decent beer.  Thanks Steve.
"
1," bottle, german aroma, pale, clear, white foam, medium bitterness, medium body, average carbonation, bitter, long finish, not a bohemian pils but german helles i thing, Average beer
"
1," This brew poured a large head of fine to large sized mostly lasting bubbles that left a good lacing and a golden amber colored body behind.  It had a mild malt aroma.  Its flavor was a bit on the hoppy side for a brown ale with only some malt notable.  Its mouthfeel was smooth.  Overall, its mouthfeel and flavor was unexpected for brown ale but was more typical of a pale ale.
"
1," Its a light lager, so you cant expect much, but there is a pleasant hint of fruitiness that makes this better than the generic macros.  Still, as forgettable as the style should be.
"
1," Cinnamon, clove, fruity, and walnut flavors.  Very smooth on the palate.  A dark reddish tan with lots of head.  Well carbonated but doesnt bite in your mouth.  Excellent.
"
1," In bottle; pours a red/brown cloudly color. Aroma was not great, might of been the glass it was poured into. taste was good, almost too mild in body though. Very smooth and very easy drinking. I good beer, but I prefer the Blue
"
1," Danger, danger, danger.  This stuff is great.  Very full bouquet and a lot of flavor.  If you like a slightly sweet Belgian beer, then this will not disappoint.  Yeah, its trendy, but its good.
"
1," Bottle at home. hay, brown, cloudy, aminimal head, lightly bitter, medium body, average carbonation,
"
1," Pours brown with a nice frothy head. Slightly sweet aroma. Smooth and very flavorful with a great creamy texture.
"
1," Copper/amber pour with white head and lace. Aroma is caramel malt and brown sugar. Brown sugar, bread, and light abv. A bit thin and fizzy for me but a very nice beer.
"
1," Amber, no discernable bubbles. More hops then malt with long finish.
"
1," Super fruity, caramel and hop aroma.  Woody, hoppy, English cast.  Some butte, pretty bitter.  FInish is a bit clingy.  Bottle, McNivens, Indianapolis.
"
1," Peterborough Beer Festival...ages ago - just found the rating slip.  This beer is clear amber with a small bubbly head.  Aromas are toffee, spices and hops.  Flavours are pear, toffee and an earthy character.  Dry on the finish.  Good stuff.
"
1," 75 cl bottle shared. Pours cloudy-red coloured with a big head. Some initial sharp bitter citrus flavour with a slight taste of caramel in the back ground. Over all the red does not meet the hype, it tastes good, but there are better Belgian Ales to be had.
"
1," Pours a murky, cloudy brown with a thin tan head. The flavor was kind of malty with a sweet and spicy finish. Strong beer but the alcohol is well hidden. This is one of the best beers Ive ever had.
"
1," Half pint gravity fed at the Battersea Beer Fest, dark ruby colour with a two-fold head - first part thick and foamy with a bubbly head on top of that. A rich malty aroma with hints of fruit. Fruits again at the front of the mouth (apricots?), but I dont get the caramal in the tasting notes. Quite sweet all the way through.
"
1," Pours golden with plenty of foam. Aroma of fruit and a little alcohol. Tastes of banana, apple, pear. Little burn of alcohol. Got what I expected but little more.	I might try it again, but Id rather stick to the blue.
"
1," One year old bottle.  The beer gods dont seem to love this one as much as I do.  Perhaps this is due to inexperience on my part, having tried only a few Belgian strongs.  Smooth malty flavor, very complex.  Amazing champagne like mouthfeel.  Very good.
"
1," Trash. Poured a nice yellow with a thick head. Aroma again of butter popcorn. Flavor all butter popcorn, so crappy.
"
1," OCT 9, 2009 Bottle, 7%. Yeasty, malty aroma, slightly spicy with some CO2. Hazy chestnut colour, semi-stable tan head. Quite yeasty flavour with a long malty aftertaste. Not as sweet as some dubbels, but not really dry either. Mouthfeel a little swelling, due to quite high carbonation.
"
1," FEB 23, 2010 Dark coca-colaish with nice foam. Aroma from figs and dried dark fruits. Medium sweet and fruity, Good lively carb. Body medium. Like it I do.
"
1," My bottle said 11% abv. This one is dark brown and would be clear except for all the yeasties. There was no head or lacing to speak of. Nice aroma of alcohol. Crisp carbonation and alcohol flavor with warmth in the aftertaste. Medium body. Some flavor of raisins, figs, plums. Based on my scores, I guess you could say I was disappointed by this one.
"
1," Draft @ brewpub. Milky pale yellow with thick 3 inch white milk shake head. Aroma is not bad, is fresh, dry, wild, floral, and farmy. Nice quaffable dry palate. Acidic finish is nice. Good level of carbonation. Some banana hefe esters.
"
1," Nearly clear golden body with a thin white head, quickly and fully diminishing. Vague hops leave the glass first in the aroma, vegetal and citric at once. Toasted malt is moderate and incohesive. DMS is scattered in clumps throughout each inhalation. The flavor is much the same, with rampant DMS and sad hoppiness. Malt is moderately toasty and everything is vegetal. The finish is lightly sweet, lightly bitter and oily. The body is prickly with light carbonation, watery and oily pockets inter-dispersed and colliding. Awful.
"
1," Dark brown in color. Fresh aroma of plums, raisins a little yeasty on the nose. Alcohol is mild, doesnt interfere with the balance of malts and dried fruit
"
1," This was really good. Dark brown pour, dark tan head, cloudy. Aroma of dark fruit and caramelized sugar. Flavor was sweet and a little bit spicy. I picked up on some notes of chocolate surprisingly. Could barely taste the alcohol. Dark malt with banana fruitiness. Lasting finish. Good Belgian
"
1," Bottled@Bjrntasting. Yellowish golden colour, small white head. Aroma is earth,grass, sweet malts, some yeast and also quite saltwatery. Flavour is quite much the same.
"
1," Well, not the most extraordinary coffee stout but certainly drinkable.  It opens with a very coffee-grounds aroma, and the initial flavors reflect the same tendency to a crass understanding of ""coffee"".  Coffee is best when it balances, smoothens, and rounds out the flavors, not when it bonks your tongue with a sharp bitterness.  But then, Im a guy who tends to drink a cafe mocha--or at least a cup with a cream and a sugar--rather than a black coffee.  But like so many beers, my palate was deadened over time and by the end of the bottle it was more drinkable than it was initially.  Interesting, worth trying, and reasonably decent--neither the best nor the worst coffee stout Ive had.  Bottle.
"
1," This ale has as much flavor as any I have tried. The only problem is the taste is one that is not particularly interesting to me. The body is also quite viscous for an ale and can be cloying. This is such an interesting beer that I dont hesitate recommending it; its simply not within my personal taste perameters.
"
1," Bottled@Bjrntasting. Pale golden colour, white head. Aroma is hops, mild earth, wood and some grains. Flavour is malts, some mild notes of herbs and also mild earthyness.
"
1," bread, nutty, some dark fruit. Great stuff.
"
1," Pours a nice ruby color, decent head, with a stellar model lace. Smells of fruits, raisins, carob and oak. Taste is fruity up front, with some nice spicy malts and a hint of hop for balance. Light to medium body, with a hyper -active mouthfeel. Very drinkable, complex, and classy, as all Chimays various versions seem to be. Another winner
"
1," FEB 13, 2008 This is one of the more straight up coffee like beers I have had and it is all the better for it.  A very drinkable brew and not to strong
"
1," Excellent brew.  Dark amber color.  Nice complex brew with a great blend of malt and hopps flavor.  Medium bodied at best but a nice mouth feel.  Some what spicy as well.
"
1," Tastes like Chimay Blue if blue was not filtered. Again, I have to state that trappist beers are not my thing, and red did not change my mind. Strong nose of malt, yeast, and alcohol. Taste hangs out with you for a few minutes after drinking. There was something wrong with this beer that I can't seem to put my finger on. I think that if people tasted this blind and did not see that it was a Chimay coming out of an attractive bottle, they would give it much lower ratings. IMO, a very overated beer.
"
1," Pours a bright orange with a rather non existent head.  aroma consists of stale hops, citrus/ tangerine. An interesting flavor, some grass, not overly bitter but certailny not sweet. Lacking Flavor but non offensive
"
1," Smells malty. Tastes quite smooth and malty. The flavor is quite good! The palate is evenly balanced and bold without being overbearing. Just very good and nice. Not over the top, but very pleasant.
"
1," Coconut and honeydew nose. Milky semen color and clarity, very unappealing. Very sweet initial flavor. Overripe lemons and plums, Finishes with oaty rice, grist, and mold.Sweeter than any sake Ive had before, but I rather like it. The appearance is vile, however.
"
1," Bottle.  Pours a chestnut brown with a thick beige head.  Wonderful aroma of fruit, caramel, yeast, raisins.  Mouthfeel is nice, although Id prefer a bit less carbonation.  A very nice beer, but I have to rate it a bit below the average.
"
1," great beer
"
1," cherries, pear, raisin. Starts off spiced malt, then gets very sweet, and then finishes with a high alcohol bite. Deceptively potent. Pretty good stuff, but way overpriced.
"
1," Light slightly dusty aroma. Dark red color with a big white, fluffy head. Semi sweet, a hint of toffee (maybe). No bitterness. Some fruitiness.  Thin with ever so slightly scratchy carbonation. Kinda dries my tongue.
"
1," Bottle poured into Chimay glass. Pours cloudy yellow amber with thick white head. Nice spicy aroma, proper taste. Great beer.
"
1," dull, dry, dusty hops, doesnt have a ""big hop"" profile.  It struck me that this is an English IPA.  However, the funny thing is that the menu describes this beer as an ""American-style, single hop varietal with domestic Fuggles.""  Theres your contradiction"
1," Pours red-caramel with off-white head. Aroma is malt, fruit, and caramel. Flavor is fruit, caramel, and malt. Very smooth.
"
1," Ive had this bottle of 2002 Chimay Red sitting in my closet for several months now and presently decided to show it whose boss! 	 Pours a deep mahogany body with a fizzy cream-colored head. An aroma of apples, pears, an amazing spicy presence, a nice musty note, as well as old but conditioned leather .. It really evokes memories about going to my familys old river cabin, cedar wood, the musty sweet stale air in the forest, damp compounding foliage.This brew is very earth and placid, Quit Amazing!   	 The body is medium, and finishes with a creamy spicy and dry staleness. I find it remarkable when brewers are able to create a beer with a natural earthiness without it being lackluster.... Chimay Red is certainly World Class!
"
1," NOV 15, 2009 Rating based on aged samples A beer with an enormous potential. Apart from fresh Chimay Bleus ive also tasted two, three and (thanks to jbrus) five, ten, 15 and 20 year old ones. A fresh Chimay is nice, malty and a bit yeasty with notes of raisins, liquorice and some alcohol. However, it is nothing compared to aged one. After two years the flavour has not really changed much, but after 3 years an obvious difference occurs, its much more complex"
1," Bottle, Legendary Lancs Heroes, Crosby. How does this stuff rate so high? I remenber being underwhelmed by this back in my early days of belgian berer tasting in 2003, but thought Id give it another chance....Reddy brown colour, looked quite appealing. Malty aroma. Flavour had some fruit and spice.Creamy mouthfeel mixed with an unpleasant carbonation that is just wrong.  Dont believe the hype ! NOT a great beer.
"
1," Pours a regal deep amber cloudy color with a thick, creamy head.  Very complex and aromatic upon nosing, with sugestions of dark fruit cake, spiced brandy, raisins, molases, vanilla-caverndish tobacco, and rum-soaked cedar wood.  Full bodied, almost chewy with an oily mouthfeel.  Equally complex taste with hints of candied dark fruits infused in ancient oak-barrel-aged brandy.  The taste develops into suggestions of  burnt sugar, plumbs, oloroso sherry, and warm cinamon-raisin bread.  Long, warming, tappering finish with appetizing hop bitterness, and slightly acidic astringency with notes of tart black cherries, figs, vanilla, and spiced rum.  Try with a tradition monastery-prepared dark fruitcake drenched with brandy or cognac.  Also try with cherries jubilee or Banana fosters desert with vanilla bean icecream.
"
1," A ruby brown color on the edges with a pillar of dark brown ale in the center. Smells very yeasty with a little spice. Sweet raison with hops and a skoch of alcohol. warms the belly and tastes good.
"
1," bottle-i made my way through a fairly fresh 6pk about 2 months ago.  At first, i didnt care for the beer at all.  I had flying dog IIPA wild dog right before it, so i was biased.  Subsequent visits to this beer definately improved.  nose is mostly fresh citric and lighty grassy/green hops-pretty pleasant.  flavors show pale grains and light hops, but for some reason, i get a lager character, maybe in the hops.  I dunno.  its pretty decent though.  body is soft with pleasant sharp carbonation.  short finish of light citrus.  a decent session pale from Indiana.
"
1," NOV 28, 2010 had this beer in a bottle sitting in a cafe on  Grand Place.  brown Cloudy and sweet with alcohol contribution to the experience but not overtly so, No haed, No Lacing just velveety smooth.  Lots of fruits and baked molasses background	Nov 2010 another bottle but from Giant Eagle.  Quite a bit of lacing and head
"
1," Pours a deep, dark red body with a fluffy beige head. Aroma is dark fruits (plums and the like), malts, and alcohol. Flavors include fruit, bread, and syrup. The taste doesnt exhibit the same alcohol characteristics as the aroma, although it is very warm and round.
"
1," Beautiful orange-red color with a big white head. The head drops to a thin but consistent white layer. Aroma is sweet, caramel. Flavour is pleasant caramel, not soo sweet, with a little bit of citruous note. A very nice beer, I would like to have it more often.
"
1," bottle; Pours a cloudy dark brown with dark red-brown hue. light and composed head that comes out the top of the bottle within a minute. Tan head lingers, dense but uneven. solid lacing. Aroma is solid. Flavor has bright yeast, candy caramel sugar with some faint to strong dark fruit, strong alcohol that is muffled with dark fruit flavor. Medium body.
"
1," Cloudy with an amber color and an almost constant stream of carbonation.  Its nutty caramel flavor gave way to fruity aftertastes.  I didnt think about the alcohol content until I started to get a little silly.  The flavor was masked by the exceptional flavor.  My dinner party beer of choice.
"
1," Cute swingtop bottle	Yeast and bitterhop nose.	Murky orange-yellow, rather low but lacing head.	Grain and straw malt base, yeast and hop biterness on top.	Body to the lighter side, pleasant mouthfeel. 	I fear it might have lost a bit through the bottling, it has the potential to be a very nice brew fresh from tap at the brewery.
"
1," On tap at the Seven Bridges brewpub. Pours clear mahogany with tan head. The mild aroma has some roast and a note of dark fruity esters. At first the taste is comprised of roasty notes, some mild burnt malts, a dash of dark fruity esters and a thin layer of caramel. It then moves toward additional roasty dryness into the finish. This brew has lots of flavor for a Brown Ale which come together nicely.

"
1," Bottle. very dark brown color with a big creamy beige head. Lots of dark fruit and and some sweet malt in the aroma. Overall a very nice belgium beer and the alcohol is hidden quite nicely.
"
1," Brown, light filtered body with bold off-white head. Wheat, light yeast, apple; kind of disappointing really. Taste is much more pronounced, exactly as I like a tripel. Light sweet with a pleasant bitter finish. Oily mouthfeel. Light alcohol burn. Very smooth body, dangerously easy to drink even with the sweet start. A great beer of real highs and lows. (33cl bottle, 1,80 EUR)
"
1," 12 oz bottle pours opaque, dark and inky. Small tan head sticks around and laces well. Aroma is dark roasty malt notes. Dark chocolate and burnt coffee. Body is medium with subdued carbonation. Taste mirrors the aroma, as dark roasty notes dominate. Decent but not stellar.
"
1," Bottled. The aroma has caramel, spices, some raisin. Hazy, brown coloured beer with a medium, off-white head. The taste is sweet, has caramel malts, dried fruits, spice, abbey yeast. Medium bodied. Bit carbonated.
"
1," Very nice lager. Golden in color, nice head quickly dissapated into a light lace that lingered, mild hops with, with clean finish. Great session beer.
"
1," Really nice, a little dar, but the taste is sweet, not annoying, like a hops but with some barley in it. Realy nice foam.
"
1," Exactly as advertised, one of the finest Belgian ales.  Smooth, fruity, creamy, wonderful beer.  I moving to Belgium.
"
1," gigantic cotton candy head, definately out of the ordinary for the style.  appearance is hazy burnt sienna. aroma is dirty resin with some light citrus mixed with bizarre nuttiness. flavor is pine, citrus and odd savory note.  quite drinkable and decent hop profile but the head, some gushing bottles and slightly off notes in aroma and flavor tell me perhaps there are some QC issues. still decent enough to revisit this brewery.
"
1," Frothy head, golden color and (off course) cloudy. Herbal aroma. The flavor has chalk, grape sugar, some hopbitterness and milk. Citric with a little bit of tartness. A worthy example of the style!
"
1," Whats not to like?  The signature dusky copper colorisnt the prettiest girl at the dance, but one of the most popular, because of her other worldly charms.  I detected Eves apple in the aroma and flavor.  Spicy and crisp, like a Spanish dancer, but light in body, bold in spirit.  A woodiness that is calming and warms your heart..and gets you drunk enough to lose all control.
"
1," One of my all time favorite beers. Pours a beautiful copper color. Nice light white head. Smells of faint fruit, some alcohol and spice. Drinks smooth and clean, works extremely well with creamy goats cheeses.
"
1," Mmmm.  Chimay Blue has such a nice floral taste with the perfect combo of strong yeast.  One of the best in the world.
"
1," Hazy, deep golden coloured, visible carbonation, small, but lacing head; (sweetish-)grainy and (sourish-)yeasty nose; solid sweet-bitter flavour with a tinge of acidity, medium bodied; sweetish-malty, warming finish with a touch of alcohol. Not bad, but not overwhelming..........

1," Nice dark brown appearance. Nutty, hoppy flavor. Was very impressed as to how good it was and not too over powering.
"
1," Bottle. Poured with a gigantic head with large bubbles. Aroma is lightly dusted with cocoa powder and roasted malts. Taste is a nice, light concoction of vanilla, bourbon, chocolate and smoke. Very nice porter.
"
1," Dark, frothy and with a touch of sweetness.  Light on the hops, but well orchestrated with the malts. A vanilla bean and light coffee prescence. Smooth on the palate and very drinkable. Id put it on the upper end of ""run of the mill"" stouts.
"
1," Draft @ brewpub. Lemony yellow. Cloudy and looks like lemon curd. Stable head. Aroma of lemon ice. Delightfully sour, intense, and lactic. Super tart. Nice lemon curd pocket is very refreshing because it finishes with acidity. Minty or basil notes add accents. Difficult to rate overall because its thin but a lot of fun.
"
1," Dark brown, cloudy, with a bit of sediment and a thin white head that doesnt fade. Dark fruits, black pepper, and caramel in the aroma. Soft, velvety texture that is full of caramel, toast, black pepper, a little banana, and butter. A little heat from the 9% ABV warms on the way down.		As with most Trappist beers, the more it warms and the more you savor this, the more complex and delicious it becomes. A 25 ounce bottle is not enough!		Outstanding. A must-have
"
1," APR 10, 2007 Bottle (330ml) (my last one!) in a Chimay goblet.  Poured cloudy (some dark sediment at bottom), a lively dark reddiish-brown - full off-white creamy head, initially fizzy, settled to an acceptable cover.    Sweet-sharp malty to my nose, quite yeasty and noticeable alcohol - clove, spices, coriander, sour apple and fresh-cut pine resin come in after.  Mouthfeel very even - oily, a bit carbonated.  Flavour very delicate - spices, mild malt, touch of bitterness, quite a bit of forest-after-the-rain there (shrooms, mulch, leaves) - very easy on the go-down, alcohol very restrained for 9%.  Hope the LCBO brings this one back in fall 05 - I will buy a case!  *update"
1," I was impressed with this Belgian Strong Ale.  I bought the larger bottle, cork was stamped 01/08 so it was a new vintage.  It poured a very dark tan with a light tan, fairly large head.  The head stayed through out the drink.  Palate was nice, slightly creamy, little bubbly.  Flavor was slightly sweet, with nice roast malt flavor.  You could smell the yeast - smelt like bread dough really.  Good beer - one of the best, in my top 10.
"
1," Bottle, 33cl. Pours an unclear red/amber colored beer with an offwhite head. The aroma is fruit and yeast. The flavor is fruit and just enough hops to create a balanced beer. The palate is soft and balanced. Overall this beer is easy drinkable.
"
1," Grain and flowers aroma. Golden/yellow color, white head, fair lace. Light bitter start, grainy, more bitter in the finish, dusty, chemical.
"
1," Pours a cloudy blood orange into a Chimay glass.  Dried fruit notes.  Lively and full.  Spicy with a dry, slightly metallic aftertaste.
"
1," Poured dark honey/orangey.  Aroma was floral.  Taste was pine and floral hops, not as much citrus as I expected.  Not one of my favorite IPAs.
"
1," Amber/Copper colour, with an aroma of ginger,  nutmeg, cinnamon, lemon, caramel. Flavour is quite spicy with ginger and nutmeg dominating.  Finishes spicy and sweet. The 8% ABV is nicely masked with the loads of spice and flavour.  A nice beer winter ale.
"
1," 12oz bottle acquired in trade with Sephiroth (thanks!). Poured a deeper amber/orange color with an averaged sized off white head. Aromas of citrus, grapefruit, pine, light caramel, and had a floral/green hoppiness to it. Tastes of grapefruit, oranges, light caramel, and had a sugary sweetness to it as well.  Not overly bitter. Not bad, a beer I could sit down and drink a sixer of.
"
1," Very delicious.  Dark and robust.  Complex and pleasant to the senses.  A full bodied trappist brew.  One of the better strong ales.
"
1," On tap at Disney World location.  Pours a brownish amber with an average off white lacing head.  Aroma of orange hop with a nice malty caramel balance.  Roastiness in the flavor with some nice citrus and a slight bitter finish.  Enjoyed this the most out of the beers I sampled.
"
1," Wow.  Tons of carbonation which produce a nice head but then whisks it away rather quickly.  Nice aroma of yeast and some fruit (cherry).  Very good color of deep orange/copper.  Carbonation is a little bit much and distracts from the flavor of the beer.  As soon as you put the beer into your mouth it explodes into a bubbly concoction.  Perhaps this will get better as the beer warms.  Flavor is a bit sour and bitter with apricot, malt and yeast.  The finish is a little bitter with a plesant alcohol warming.  A good quality beer but there are better trappists out there.
"
1," A most noble brew deserving of our highest respect.. Throatwarming and yeasty...
"
1," Bottle at GBBF 2007.  Cloudy gold, lasting cream head.  Good banana, lacks some body, cereal and spice.  Disappointing weisse.  Cardboardy.

1," Very simlar to Chimay Blue but with a milder aroma and less intoxicating. Very fruity flavour.
"
1, on-tap		Reviewed on
1," Bottle pours light caramel, small fizzly white head, with tons of little yeasty bits floating about.  Aroma is typical belgian yeastiness.  Light fig/date on the flavor, more belgian yeast, finishes tart.  While not overly carbonated, it seems to generate the largest burps.  Tiz alright, but seems as if it could use more flavor & spices.

1," My favorite beer(although there are many out there still to try!). Taste is oh, so smooth. Has an almost sweet taste to it but can be heavy at first. I love to sip it after some BBQ and college football games.

1," APR 13, 2003 2002 version 750ml bottled"
1," FEB 23, 2005 Dozens of subtle delicacies once roamed in this one...Black currants, prunes, white grapes and raspberries...Brown sugar, birch, tea, smoke...Today, coriander and orange zest prevail in a pleasant yet tranquil, candyish nose but the body and flavors resort to a tinny, fizzy mineral character which dishonors its predecessors...A minute one amongst many, as if it was put in an old persons home, sedated with unknown substances, awaiting death...
"
1," Tasted from a 330 mL bottle purchased in Aurora, Colorado. Red/orange/brown and hazy appearance. Creamy light brown head. Sweet Belgian ale aroma with candy sugar. Great sweet Belgian flavor, again with candy sugar. Very smooth and a tad bit fruity, particularly red fruits, with a note of brown sugar. Alcohol not noticeable. Absolutely delicious.

1," From the 750ml bottle		Pours an opaque nut brown with a thin creamy tan head. Sheets of lace. Smells of caramel, molasses. Fruity plum aromas. Earthy, bready, grainy.		Tastes has lots of oakiness. Hints of vanilla. Molasses. Rich malt. Bready. Bitter finish. Rich in the mouth. A decent sipper but somehow it doesnt all come together. Aroma is magnificent but taste cant live up to it. I have to say I like the White and the Red better.
"
1," On tap at Big River Grille, Nashville.  This is the only decent beer of the batch I tried.  Typical chocolate aroma and taste.  Nothing that blows you out of the water but drinkable.
"
1," MAY 23, 2006 (cask, 5/20/06) Clear copper body with soft beige head that retains well.  Aroma is moderately sweet, perfumey, melon, orange.  Taste is medium sweet, earthy, some grapefruit, caramel, light pine, dusky.  Medium body, some stickiness.  (6/4/6/3/13) 		(draft, 5/21/06) Off-white head atop a crystal clear copper body.  Aroma is medium sweet, floral/grapefruit.  Taste is medium sweet, grapefruit, some caramel, orange.  Fairly bitter.  Soft medium body, some acidity.  (7/3/6/3/12)
"
1," Dark brown pour with ruby highlights and a thin offwhite head. Interesting, but not captivating aroma and flavor of caramel malt with a lingering sweetess. The body is light to medium with a liquorous texture and soft carbonation. This is totally without flaws, but its average for the style.
"
1," On tap at the Disney World Boark Walk location. Poured a dark black with a smaller sized off white head. Aromas of chocolate and roasted malts. Tastes of roasted malts, coffee, and chocolate. Light bitter finish. My favorite out of the six beers I had there.
"
1," Nose of sweet bread mild cites hops a little oxidized. Pours nice golden creamy white head. Sweet bread pale malt light to medium citra hops fruitiness as well as a little bitterness and a hint of dank.
"
1," Coppery brown pour into THICK foamy (slightly creamy) head that dissipates into a ring of foam around the rim and a pool of bubbles in the center of the glass. Aroma of fermented fruit and yeasty sweet bread. Initial flavor of toasted caramel malt with a slightly bitter hop finish.
"
1," More yeasty than the White, more aroma than the Bleu.  I really liked this one.
"
1," Toffee coloured with an off-white head.  Aromas are biscuit malts with sweet grain and caramel.  Flavours are smooth toffee malts with some pine.  Quite sweet with some citrus notes.  Has a dry, hoppy finish.  Too much carbonation in the bottle.  A solid bitter.
"
1," Bottle. Pours a murky, dark amber-brown with a beige head. Aroma is malt, nuts, yeast, melon, spices and dried fruits. Has a swimming pool-like feel to it  like chlorine, only its not chlorine. Hmm Overall, not really my thing, but well-made though. Flavour is malt, yeast, dried fruits and hops with metallic notes; the latter increasing as it warms. Fruity finish with a bit of yeast and a mild bitterness lingering. Too much carbonation. An okay beer, well-made, but not my thing. 08-08-09.
"
1," On tap at the brewpub. The owner gave me a sneak peek sample of this beer, to be officially released October 31. Golden brown with a big, thick, creamy beige head. Very complex nose - lots of spices, including (but not limited to) ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a light clove. Lots more, hard to nail them all down. An underlying pumpkin is behind the lush spiciness. Excellent, warming pumpkin pie flavors! Warming spiced finish, alcohol is present but VERY well disguised. Like a fortified wine, the nose blooms from the empty glass. Absolutely wonderful, the best Ive ever had of the style. Im no fan of pumpkin beers, but this is amazing. VERY well done, and thanks for the preview Tom!
"
1," Pours a hazy amber color, very inviting.  Has a very malty flavor, incredibly smooth, and just enough bite to balance out the sweet flavors.  Has a nice thick feel, and carbonated just right.  An excellent beer!
"
1," Draft sample at IBGW 2011. Poured clear brown color with an average frothy brown head that was lasting with good lacing. Moderate to heavy ginger, spice and sweet aroma. Medium to full body with a smooth texture and flat carbonation. Medium to heavy sweet spice flavor with a medium to heavy sweet finish of moderate to long duration. Better then my expectations winter brew.
"
1," Pours from bottle a cloudy mohagany brownish/red with lively carbonation and a thick head. Aroma of raisons. Taste is astrigent, alcohol, yeast and raison. The carbonation and astrigency attack your tastebuds. Not for me
"
1," 2008 Bottle thanks to bu11zeye.  Pours with a creamy, thick light brown head and great lacing. Hazy brown body. Aroma of bananas, chocolate, toffee and a bit of dried cranberry. Taste is a bit metallic with dark fruits and spice. Bitter Finish. Syrupy mouthfeel with light bubbles.
"
1," 12oz bottle from Secret Santa 2011.  Pours slightly hazy orange-gold with a creamy white head.  Nose is caramel, slight butterscotch, red grapefruit transitioning into pine.  Flavor is light malt, caramel, some grapefruit, grassy bitterness, and pine with some grassy bitterness.  Medium in body and ok.
"
1," MAY 22, 2007 Dark amber color with a medium head.  Roasted malt really comes through.  Plenty of sweetness in the shadow of dark fruit.  I personally prefer the Chimay White, but this is an excellent, darker alternative.
"
1," Aroma of belgian yeast, grapes and some brown sugar. High carbonation. A little roasted flavor with hints of toffee.
"
1," Poured a very hazy dark copper with a creamy off-white head. Aroma was apricot, some raisin or dates and bit acidic. Taste is bread, fruits, and acidic as well. Very fizzy mouthfeel.
"
1," 12oz bottle.  Pours opaque with a thin tan head.....light lacing.  Tons of fresh coffee and cocoa dust in the nose.
"
1," Poured a dark brown color with a moderate yet evanescent head.  Mild aroma of yeast and some sweet malt scents.  Excellent flavor with some nice roastiness and a well-balanced finish.  Slightly fizzy mouthfeel.  The alcohol content is pleasantly cloaked by the slightly sweet roasted malt flavor.  Went great with my superb meal at the Old Tabard Inn, where we went the night before I graduated with my doctorate.
"
1," DEC 31, 2009 12 oz. bottle at Lunar Brewing Co.. Poured a dark brown with some ruby tones showing through, a foamy, tan head and very good curtains and spots of clingy lacing. The aroma was mainly a pleasant, soft vanilla and nuttiness combo, light brown sugar sweetness, with a hint of bourbon. The flavor was roasty, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, and just enough supportive hop bitterness. Good body and creamy on the tongue. A very respectable Porter.
"
1," Bottled.  Poured deep ruddy brown with an explosive cap of deep tan head (Im talkin an inch of liquid and 5.5"" of head!).  The aroma picked up lightly-roasted semi-sweet chocolates, toasted oatmeal, and more charred black malts.. dusty overall with a bit of detergent character that detracted a bit.  The flavor had roasted sweeter chocolates and rolled oats with darker chocolates and coffee more toward the back.. coffee provided light-moderate bitterness, and carries through the short, but enjoyable finish.  Just a tad shy of medium-bodied with a creamy middle on the palate and nice balance.  This grew on me as the drink progressed.
"
1," bottle thanks to bu11zeye.  light brown pour with a thin cream head. nose of yeast, musk and fruits.  not bad on the palate with a heavy dark fruit flavor and a musky finish.
"
1," On tap at Silverton Brewery.  What a surprise this was.  Nice mild aroma of malt.  A robust red pour with a nice loose head.  Malty flavor finishes quickly with a soft hop presence.  Not sweet, nicely dry and easy to drink.
"
1," cask at the brewpub - The bartender assured me that this beer was not their regular bottled brown ale, but a new beer made for their cask.  It pours dark brown with minimal head.  The aroma is mostly caramel malt with a bit of dark fruit in there.  It tastes very sweet and full of caramel.  The dark fruit from the aroma is detectable.  Its medium bodied and has a very low carbonation level even for the cask.
"
1," Shared by JCB. Poured a nice dark brown with a one finger foamy light tan head. Nose shows some of they typical belgian sweetness, yeasty, estery, dark fruits. Flavor is pretty tasty, sweet and estery, malty character. Raisiny. Nice carbonation.
"
1," Gold body that has a slight haze to it.  Average sized whitye head that falls quickly.	Light malt aroma, sweet corn and faint hops.	A watery palate delivers a brew with little flavor. Some sourness.  Effervescent.
"
1," This beer pours a dark brown color with a ruby tint. Medium-thin beige head and sticky lacing at the top of the glass. The aroma consists of coffee and burnt chocolate. Medium-bodied and smooth with a decent mixture of coffee, chocolate and malt flavors. The hops come through pretty well in the finish. Overall this is a well-balanced and fairly well-done Porter.
"
1," @GCBF-on tap-pours an off white head and amber color.  Aroma is medium malt-caramel, faint hops.  Taste is medium malt-caramel, some fruit, faint hops/some English/flat bite.  OK/mild carbonation.
"
1," Pours a murky, mahogany-hued body with an inch of fizzy, off-white head.		Smell"
1, Hop dominant but accompanied by freshly squeezed citrus juices (mainly lime and orange) and some forest moss. Well presented. Taste
1," Bottled (BB 10/2009)	Courtesy of bierkoning, ty Edo! Dark ruby color, small beige head. Strong aroma has sweat, prunes, wood. Typical bock-like dark maltyness with grassy hops, some alcohol and caramel.
"
1," Copper/amber color, with a large white/tan head. Aroma is yeast and fruit. Flavor is yeast, brown sugar, and fruit, but they are rather subtle. The end is dry.
"
1," This is a beer that I wish I had brought home in a growler. It is also one available in bottles. Pours almost black with a thick tan head an good lacing. The aroma is a pleasant blend of roasted coffee, malt, and chocolate. Very rich and satisfying with a strong cocoa/coffee flavor. Malt, caramel and hops are all in there for good measure too. The finish is long and roasty. This is easily the best beer from the brewpub as far as I am concerned.
"
1," (Draught) Sampled at Sailor Hagars in North Vancouver, BC, on June 20, 2006. Lasting white foam head with an unfiltered yellow body. Nose of pleasant ripe bananas. Mild creamy clove flavour beneath a light banana tongue and rose oil. It is hot and I am thirsty... this hits the spot sufficiently.
"
1," A Mes rate. Bottle. Huuuge thanks to Grant.Bought from the brewery itself. Cant believe Im adding a US beer. But add it I must according to Grant. Black brown with a thin tan film. Huge chocolate, huge bourbon, hugely complex malt but you know what? This has so much finesse its unreal. Im litterally blown away. The balance is utterly superb. NOTHING is even close to being overdone. I am really not used to this in US beers. As an Englishman, this is perfect. Vanilla, liquorice, some peat, earth, wow. This is brilliant. Huge yet cuddly and cute. Big bourbon finish but again its done SO WELL. Bloody excellent. Thanks so much to Grant for this very rare, very special treat.
"
1," Pour is a cloudy amber color with a fairly large head.  Slightly spicy and malty nose. Dark fruity flavors with a deep roasted  malt.  Fairly complex and well balanced.
"
1," Dark yellow colored with hazy appearance. Little yellow head. Rich banana aroma with spices dominating, some flowery tones also here, nice one. Medium bodied. Flavor also has rich banana with spices and some burnt rubber, aftertaste gets fruity with yeast.
"
1," pours a light tan head with cloudy brown color.  Aroma is medium malt, muted fruit.  Taste is upfront effervescence, medium malt, muted fruit, astringent, a flatness at the finish.
"
1," Bottle @ fonefan tasting. Nice head with good duration. Color is golden. Aroma and taste are wheat malt, yeast, fruits and hops.
"
1," Decent Armenian beer, light colored, reminds me of MGD.  Not terribly exciting.
"
1," Poured from a 750ml caged and corked bottle and served in a tulip.  This ale poured a dark brown color with a long lasting head of fine, dark tan bubbles.  Some very nice lacing was left around the glass.  The aroma of the beer was made up of dark fruit, candy sugar, caramel, and slightly sour cherries.  The flavor was dark fruits, candy and brown sugar,  rich caramel notes, and also a hint of alcohol in the finish.  The mouthfeel was medium-bodied with very lively carbonation stinging the tounge along with a lightly alcoholic warmth.  Great taste, great presentation.  Just an excellent beer all around.
"
1," Brown coloured, malty brew with a slightly spicy flavour; not too sweet; medium bodied; smooth.....O.K.
"
1," Reddish brown with a thick off white head. Lightly spiced and floral aroma is fairly faint. Clove spice and a nice fruity sweetness at the end. Very smooth and carbonated.

1," 33 cL bottle. Pours hazy yellow with a huge white head. Aroma is dry estery and phenolic, wheat and yeast. Mild malt note to a dry wheat estery note. Dry wheaty finish.
"
1," SEP 11, 2009 Bottle @ Metro. 7%. Dark brown/amber colour with a tan head. Aroma is toffee, hazelnut, sweet malts. Taste is light, grainy and sweet fruits. Quite pleasantly spiced and extremely smooth on the finish. Dark, strong bodied, and absolutely superb.

"
1," MAY 4, 2005 Draught in Chattanooga"
1," This was a tasting of Blue Label Mu , made in Hyogo. Crystal clear. Sweet, fruity, mellow and round sake, with peaches and melon in the nose and a dry, peppery, spicy finish. Huge, rich, flavor--she told me it was dry, but that was the finish, big sweet, fruity lusciousness up until then. Great full body. Good stuff.
"
1," Only slight maltaroma. Malty, only slightly hoppy and fruity (pear) taste. Thin bodied. Very clean and crisp taste. Well made light lager.
"
1," Good beer, I prefer the grand reserve or the white bottle to this, however; this is still a well made beer.
"
1," Dark brown color with a large creamy off-white head that lasts the entire beer.  Medium malt aroma with some spiciness and fruit.  Alcohol is the main aroma the last 1/3 of the glass.  Nice mouthfeel as you get a bit of foam with each sip that accentuates the malt taste.  As funny as this may seem this was much better than the red since the alcohol was not as overwhelming even though it has a higher ABV.  On a side note who wrote the commercial description,""Its flavour, noticed when tasting it"", how else can you detect a beers flavor except by tasting it, is there some other way I dont know about.  Are there Aliens rating these beers, thats all we need drunk space creatures on earth, oh wait that would be Michael Jackson. Nevermind.
"
1," On tap at Big River  Chattanooga.  Poured clear bright yellow with a short cap of off-white head.  The aroma was very light with some lighter fruits and honey.. pleasant enough.  The flavor had honey and bready notes at the core supporting almost sour bread and odd, tacky vegetal notes.. not very good.  Light-bodied with higher carbonation.. sharp and ugly in all the wrong places.
"
1," Dark red-brown-orange, fine cream colored head.  Toasty apple aroma, caramel.  Taste is grainier, light fruit, carmel.
"
1," Gold with a white head. Years ago, before glue came in white sticks, it used to be a golden liquid which smelled and tasted very like this beer. How come I knew the taste? Odd. This is sour and papery and rather nasty.
"
1," Part of a sampler at Rock Bottom Atlanta.  Very poor, boring beer.  Flavor and aroma are bland.
"
1," Draught @ Staffelberg-Bru, Am Mhlteich 4, Loffeld, Bavaria, Germany 96231.Clear medium to light dark amber orange colour with a average to large, frothy, good lacing, fully lasting, off-white to white head.

1," Tap Seven bridge, Jax, FL. Not sure why its ending up here.	pours golden light, very transluscent, thin white head.	Aroma is grainy, some hops and light malts.	Flavor, just insignificant, sweet, crisp mouthfeel, some light hops, palate of diluted apple juice with hints of malts.
"
1," Amazing, Druglike enjoyment, pleasant copper colour, nice maltiness, low bitterness, good balance.
"
1," 750mL. Big smooth creamy head. Carbonated highly to perfection. Surprised by how straight forward this is. Not super estery, fruity, spicy, but enough. And it is all well balanced. NIce malty richness, but obviously quite dry.
"
1," Clear, effervescent, yellow body with a thin, fizzy, white head.		Smell"
1," Ok, this was truly a bad beer. It tasted nothing like a stout at all. The aroma was overpowering butterscotch and buttered popcorn. The flavor was disgusting vinegar. Maybe the line was dirty or the beer was infected but this thing was a mess, foul and disgusting.
"
1," Tasted blind with savvy1982 vs Rochefort 10, Westy 12, and Dieu du Ciel! Rigor Mortis Pours a dark brown with caramel highlights. Small but retaining head. Aroma is faint... Almost non-existent. Some yeast, dark fruit, orange, anise, apples, and seaweed. Very tight nose. Tastes better than the nose. Cherries, apples, toast, plums, cinnamon, clove, salt all on the palate. Mouth feel is soft, but not lively. OK, but not great.
"
1," 750ml bottle.	A great example of a Dubbel from the deep ruby color, to the lively carbonation.  Dark fruit and Belgian sugar aroma - fruity, alive flavor.  My least favorite of the three Chimay offerings, but still a great beer.
"
1," Bottle courtesy of Biggmike. This beer poured a medium brown color with a good off-white head. Flavors of dark malt and fruit. Great mouthfeel and perfect carbonation. This is really an excellent beer.
"
1," Pours a cloudy orange/amber with a respectable white head.  Aroma is mild hops and sweet malt.  Clean crisp sweet malt and maple syrup flavor with significant, but not over done, hoppy tartness.  Pretty decent American pale.

1," 750 mL bottle, dated 03/07.  Pours amber red with a large off-white head that quickly dissipates into a small but stable head.  Aroma is dark fruits, caramel sweetness, some tart apple, yeasty banana scents.  Flavor is dark fruits, caramel, a bit of banana.  Some mild hints of sweet and sour flavors.  Lively carbonation that complements the flavors well.  No lasting lacing.  I used to think I might not be a big fan of Belgian-style ales, but after Orval and this I guess I just wasnt trying the right ones!
"
1," Pretty good offering from Barley Island. Not the best IPA Ive ever had, but its different from most of the average ones, which is good. Pours a really nice amber color, with a perfect head. Lots of carbination bubbles. Very piney aroma and flavor, nice balance of citrus, and a little malt mixed in. Bitterness on the back end, with a metallic aftertaste (which I didnt care for). A little too sticky, but a good local brew.
"
1," Bottle 750ml, vintage 1999. Big beer, with a nice plums and raisins taste. Very good aging properties, lots of port and madeira. Big alc. bite. Excellent!
"
1," SEP 13, 2009 330ml bottle.  Pours a muddy, cloudy brown with a tan head.  Nose is of raisins and some barnyard.  taste is nicer than the smell with raisins and caramel most noticeable.  Mouthfeel is medium-to-thin with tons of carbonation.  Nice brew.
"
1," Slightly more malty than hoppy in aroma and flavor.  Not bad really, a lingering bitter finish helps this clean up decently.
"
1," 750ML single (as a Christmas gift!)...pours dark brown with some red tint around the edges of the glass, off-white head...complex aroma, brown sugar, spice, small dark fruits - cherries, red grapes, prune...flavor of malts, spice (clove?), dark fruits, touch of black licorice...quite carbonated at first but the flavor became better and more pronounced and the alcohol more apparent as it warmed and carbonation dulled.
"
1," This pours dark with a small head that does have a little lacing.  The aroma is fruit and malts with a little yeast.  This hits the tongue and instantly satisfies and keeps on going as it hite the back of the tongue.  This is the best of the Chimays and a very good bear for any type.  The monks do things right in Belgium.
"
1," A good beer.  A strong beer.  Something everyone should try.  Rich, complex maltiness.
"
1," Poured from a 75 CL bottle. dark brown color and a substantial frothy head. A toasty malty flavor with hints of sweetness that is not to overpowering. An amazing flavor is left lingering on the palate. Another great Belgium beer that should be both appreciated and respected.
"
1," Strong fruity, almost wine like aroma.  Some alcohol in the nose as well.  Very pleasant.  A reddish golden brown.  Small tan head that quickly dissipates.  Very malty, not too sweet, nice and clean in the finish with slight alcohol.  Some creaminess as it warms, perhaps some spices as well.  Mouthfeel is very bubbly and carbonated.  Nice and full.
"
1," This was by far the best of the selection at big river.  nice medium mouthfeel.  good dark brown with light tan head.  dry, toasted marshmellow (i keep finding this lately in stouts-- is it just me??)  malty, chocolatey, roasted toasted and pretty decent, but lacking something... isk what...
"
1," Second time i hade this and the same thing happened when i opened the bottle that time; a small fountain of foam that wont stop, maybe my beer got disturbed by this.	Pours a red hazy body with that nice pillar of bubbles rising in the middle thanks to the nicely designed chimay glas, it has an large creamy head.	Aromy is fruita and spicy.	Flavor is fruity and spicy to.	Palate is thick and smooth.

1," Pours opaque reddish brown with 1 finger foamy white head into trappist glass. Smells subtly sweet of esters and yeast, taste is creamy and rich with a little fruit.
"
1," MAY 6, 2010 Only slight maltaroma. Sweetish, malty taste. Fruity (raisin, blackcurrant, pear). Slight hopbitter and fruity finish. Very clean beer, there is nothing present of the barnyard aroma you find in many Franconian beers. Very well brewed beer, could use a bit more power. 		I was less enthousiastic about a swing top bottle I found recently in Nordhorn. Soft maltaroma. Malty floral bready flavor with hints of toffee and plum.
"
1," Bottle. Apperance; dark brown, hazy with a nice head. Aroma of fruits and light yeast with a complex flavor of lots of fruits. Very good!

1," JUL 1, 2008 As Chimay Blanche"
1," This Chimay poured with a mahagony body and a 2 finger white frothy head. Lots of bubbles and a great tingly carbonation. The palate is so very smooth and fills my mouth nicely. The aroma is floral with a bit of apricot. A nice spicy flavor, alcohol in the aftertaste that warms my stomach. Maybe some cloves. The head lasts the whole glass and is clinging to the side.

The aroma is pleasant, with hop and toffe, but not very fresh, nor impressive. Good toffee flavor, and good bitterness level; the hopping is pleasant, resiny, a bit fruity, but not true to a real fresh Citra.Maybe not fresh.2011-04-08, bottle from Kapilano Wine, 8-4-7-5-16=40Hazy golden color; medium sized head.

1," S-suerlicher Kruterantrunk mit herben und etwas muffigen Nuancen. Danach frischer, etwas getreidig, die dezente Suerlichkeit dominiert. Die wird noch etwas spitzer, die Getreidigkeit hlt mit, das wenige helle Malz wird eher mitgeschliffen. Frisch suerlich, dafr wenig vollmundig. Ein absolutes Sommerbier fr heie Tage! 11/11/10/8/8/10
"
1," flavors of bread, toast, biscuits, toffee, plums, apricots, raisins and dried cherries, with very mild hops bitterness. Medium body and full, ""chewy"" mouthfeel. Alcohol could be felt, smooth and warming, but not at all harsh or overpowering. Dry finish, particularly for such a malty beer, with a lasting peppery aftertaste. No single aspect dominated; this beer could be the very definition of well-balanced. An absolute masterpiece of brewing, one of the greatest.
"
1," Large Bottle. Hazy red/brown pour no real lacing to speak of. Aroma of belgian spices and fruit. Flavor is malt and cherrys. A bit of a dry finish. I am not a huge belgian fan but this was good.
"
1," Excellent brew! Nice subtle fruit flavors with a wonderful bitterness.  Pour slowly!  Head will rise if poured to quickly
"
1," Pours a slightly hazy copper orange with a nicely-lacing frothy off-white head.  Aroma of soft, piny bitter hops and lightly sweet caramel malt.  Body starts lightly bittersweet with some mildly resiny English hops and a slight maltiness.  Drinkable, but pretty dull for the style.
"
1," Bottle. Pours a cloudy pale gold with a thin white head. Aroma is full of wheat and yeast notes as well as a strong metallic aroma. Flavor is weak with a bit of wheat, a bit of citrus and yeast.
"
1," Lots of flavor, too much to describe.  Comes in a wine bottle with a cork, and dont let the unfiltered look of the beer fool you.  Great with steak and the best out of the chimay line, one bottle will make you feel pretty good.
"
1," This is a deep red brown in color. The head is quite large, rocky and of large bubbles. I prefer a head thats a bit more even but this is nice too. Pine hops up front in the nose w/ an woody undercurrent. Hop bitterness is firm but a bit on the soapy side. Really not bad though. The biggest problem this beer has is that its overcarbonated which makes it come across as a bit watery and drowns out any sort of malt depth this might otherwise have. It is very sharp on the tong which detracts from drinkability somewhat as well. There seems like there is a decent beer going on somewhere here but the flaws override most anything enjoyable about it.
"
1," Pours a rich deep brown and red. Smell is of yeast, dark fruits and spices typical of the style (mostly cloves). Taste is fairly sweet, with a lot of the spice. Finish is mostly of alcohol. Body is pretty light, with light carbonation. Unfortunately i taste a slight metallic flavour in the finish, not what i would expect from a beer of such acclaim. It is quite a bit lighter feeling than most of the other Belgian Strong Ales ive had. Very tasty ale, but i can say i have had BSAs that i have enjoyed more.
"
1," (can 7/10/10). Clear brown color. Medium off white head. Moderate toast, malt, and light caramel aroma and flavor. Short duration. Light dry finish. Thin texture. Moderate carbonation. Fair lacing.
"
1," Not too much of a smell. Nice reddish transparent look. Nice mild taste. Defitely have had better pale ales but this one had a good sweet not over powering taste.
"
1," MAR 23, 2005 This is the best beer Ive ever had in my life. It has no strong alcoholic bite. Its full of fruit flavors without being too sweet. Although Ive tried more complex and adventures Belgians like the Westvleteren 12, the Chimay Bleu is just right to me.
"
1," AUG 31, 2007 Poured an opaque and dark reddish brown with an average sized, lasting creamy off-white head. The aroma was delightful and balanced with undertones of caramel and fruits. The mouth feel is extremely smooth with a perfect level of carbonation tingling the tip of your tongue. It seems full-bodied, almost hearty but remains very drinkable. As with the nose, no flavors stand out distinctively, but the blend itself is unique indeed. A perfect lacing covers all sides of the glass, fine and almost mathematically symmetrical. The alcohol content (9%) is noticeable but never overbearing. A pleasant yet complex malty aftertaste is left after each sip with no bitterness. Overall this is a powerful and exquisite beer but definitely not for everyday drinking.
"
1," Exceptionally drinkable, nice dark brown color, soft lacy head, a little hint of maltiness in the aroma, very sweet malty flavors, a little heavy on the malt as far as the balance went, some hints of roasted flavors as well, medium in body, pretty decent brown ale
"
1," Dark amber pour from a wax dipped 12oz bottle. Aroma is fairly simple -  malt and molasses, with a hint of hoppiness almost buried by the sweet smells. Very nice. Flavor is dominated by malt with brown sugar,  a bit of sour molasses and a hint of fig. A lot of hops bitterness hits the tongue, but it is scarcely noticeable amid the surgery sweet onslaught, made more so by the very well disguised ethanol sweetness. Some sort of spice comes through in the finish  Allspice perhaps. Sorta like Cinnamon but not quite. The 10% ABV is a nice feature. Palate is thick and sweet   a brew to sip by the fire on a cool autumn  night. If you answer a personal add and hope to meet a SWF, but find its a Single White Friar  just ask for a brew. You could do worse.

1," on tap @GABF-pours mahogany with a light brown head.  Aroma is smoke/peat/roasty-medium/dark malt.  Taste is smoke/peat/roasty-medium/dark malt, earthy hops.

1," My first Trappist Ale and what a great start. A strong beer with a complex flavor. Dark and malty. Floral with a fruity finish. A wonder thing to share with friends over some lively conversation.

1," [Sampled in Chiang Rai, Thailand, january 2006.]		The only good beer for 3 months found in a dutch restaurent. Darkbrown with huge aroma of fruits and yeast. Flavor is sticky of carbonation of what expected and again fruits, caramel, port and some alcoholic bitterness. Maybe its renome/reputation is declining a bit!
"
1," Supposedly this is the authentic sake from the old Samurai regions of Japan. True or not, it adds a lot of personality culture to the drink.
"
1," Thin fizzy head which disappears quickly, Nice reddish colour but cloudy. Aroma is very subtle peach with a pleasant yeasty tone. Flavour is slightly sweet and malty but quite subdued. It is very fizzy and light.
"
1," 330ml bottle.  Pours a dark cooper with a tan head.  Aroma is fruity and yeast.  Taste is yeast at first, then fruity with a medium bitter finish.  To be honest, was expecting a bit more.
"
1," Oh! this is a good beer! I had it in the 750 ml bottle. Its a strong beer, but it doesnt feel too much like it. It drinks well.
"
1," Bottle, 33 cl. Dark brown beer, medium white to beige head that lasts. Aroma of dark roasted malts. Taste are also roasted malts, caramel and chocolate, dark fruity and some spices. Becomes more specifically light sweet on the background towards the end. Subtle malty beer that offers you some different taste experiences during the beer. Nice one!
"
1," Boston Lager glass from twist-off bottle. Pours somewhere between amber and gold. Thin head. Aroma is faint. Good grain flavor, minimal hop character (for both aroma and flavor); mostly sweet flavors of chocolate and nuts. Kind of like a watered-down amber lager. Weak body. This is easy to drink, from a mouthfeel/viscosity standpoint, but lacking in the fullness quality that the best session lagers have. It honestly seems like its been diluted.
"
1," Pours a dark clear ruby brown with a very light tan head that starts off around 2 fingers and then faded.  Nice punch in the aroma, sweet toffee and malts.  Very nicely balanced -- the malts arent too sweet and the abv isnt too overpowering.
"
1," Bottle .Pours dark amber with a nice creamy off-white head.Aroma of yeast ,malt,spice ,dust and  citrus.Flavor is sweet malt,sugar,belgian yeast,spice and caramel.Medium body,lively carbonation.Nice classic Belgian.
"
1," A smooth ale, but a sharp aftertaste became unpleasant after awhile. Fair head, dry finish; however, fine compliment to a seafood dinner.
"
1," Pours a deep amber with very red hues when held to the light.  Very attractive creamy white head.  Aroma is strongly alcoholic, with some hint of yeast and balanced nicely by some hidden malts.  Alcohol fades on the taste and is replaced mostly with malts.  Loved the palate!  Silky in my mouth, lightly carbonated, easy to drink, really nice slightly hoppy/bitter finish.
"
1," Colour is deep red/brown, while the beverage is quite cloudy. The short-lived head features larger-than-average bubbles. Aromas of caramel and cherry shine through the multitude of other nuances. Alcohol bursts out of the gate, providing an instant rush, while mild spice, a vague chocolatiness and good bitterness liven up the flavour. Solid palate, with a healthy fizz sensation, supports quite nicely. A well-made beer.
"
1," Light brown with an off white, large head. Aroma of malt, spices and raisins.	Spicy, fruity, flavor with a subdued hop bitterness. Finishes crisply. My least	favorite Chimay, but thats still pretty	damn good.
"
1," Draft at BI. Small tan head, sparse lacing, opaque, no visible carbonation, and a black hue. Nose was roasted malt and roasted coffee. Flavor was roasted coffee and burnt tasting. Medium body.
"
1," 11.2 oz. bottle. Deep hazy amber and mahogany color, nearly opaque, huge light-tan head. Fresh floral and herbal aroma, yet quite subdued. Taste is bitter, earthy, with a bit of astringency. Complex, maybe a little messy? Dry finish. Weird aftertaste is reminding me of mold, just a little bit. Its been a while since Ive had a Chimay product, and I remember liking them better. Anyway, this brew is fine, but many other Belgian ales are more exciting. Try the small bottle first.
"
1," Clear golden body with a huge, fluffy white head.  Sweet, slighlty spicy aroma.  Banana and orange, coriander, vanilla, grains of paradise, coconut, peaches and a touch of lightly tart wheat husk.  The body is moderate and refreshing.  The flavors are great and have a nice balance with elegant fruity sweetness at the start moving to spice in the middle and finishing with a mild tart kick.  The finish is lasting and refreshing as heck.  I really liking this style right now, at least in the heat of the summer.
"
1," Bottled, from The Scottish Real Ale Shop, Kilmahog.  Hazy golden, rich head. Somewhat mineraly with some unpleasant boiled vegetables. Sweetish and light bodied, notes of chlorine. Low bitterness.
"
1," 22oz bottle from someone in my fantasy football league..payout from LAST year. Pours black with a huge head..a bit too lively indeed. Nice aroma of chocolate and bourbon. Smooth, nutty bourbon come on pretty strong with  just a little roast. Lightly sweet dark fruits. Kind of all over the place. Too thin.
"
1," 11.20oz bottle, pours cloudy brown.	Soap-sud head with multiple size bubbles that stick around.  Carbonation has a bit of a sharp bite.  Very slight smokeyness to this beer.  Was good, but I expected more from the Monks.	$3/bottle in Boca Raton
"
1," Pours a murky orange/brown with a lovely creamy off-white fluff on top.   Sweet doughy malt aroma, yeasty, some apples and pears.  First taste is very light, some bitterness, very light nuttiness, dry.... really quite uninteresting.  Vacant mouthful... a bit watery.  I fail to believe this tasted like this 4 or 5 years ago...
"
1," MAY 22, 2008 9 mar 2008"
1," Bottle at Nord-Ouest Caf. Interesting dubbel, light malt aromas some toast with red fruits and yeast. Taste is malty and fruity with some alcohol presence.
"
1," Bottle. Dark tea amber. Soft white foam. Strong ginger scent smells like cold gingerbread. Too much spice in a metallic vanilla-ish amber. Strong herbal finish and aftertaste.
"
1," Poured at the Charlotte Rock Bottom Brewery. Pours a beautiful dark. Light off white head. Tastes of malt.  Slightly bitter. Very smooth. Good beer. Recommended.
"
1," bottle. Poured dark brown with sediment and small off-white head. Flavours of roasted raison, light caramel and spice. Bitter dry finish. My favorite Chimay but note that its not my favorite style.
"
1," Nice dubbel.  Yeasty , alcohol, etc.  Lots of goodness going on here.  Not as good as the Blance or Bleu but still quality.
"
1," Bottle from the Keg - Pours black with a mostly receding tan head. Aroma of bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, and foamy roast. Tastes of bourbon, alcohol, vanilla, oak, spice, and chocolate. Mouhtfeel is full bodied with foamy carbonation. Similar to eating bourbon chocolates. Enjoyable, but maybe a bit too long in the barrels.
"
1," cloudy red brown coloured body with a average off white head a sweet yeasty aroma a nice sweet yeasty taste and a yeasty bitter alcoholic finich
"
1," Pours ruby brown in colour, a very large head with decent lacing.  Aroma of pepper and plums, perhaps a little coriander.  Flavour offers significant amounts of the pepper and plum, coriander and orange peel.  Very creamy mouthfeel, especially as it warms more and more.  Terrific stuff.
"
1,"Dark cola brown, with a small head and patchy lace, small visible carbonation		S"
1," On tap at the Orlando Brewpub. Dont know if it was being tired after a full day in Disney or what, but just didnt get much taste from this. Poured a light to medium brown color. Not much on the smell. Could taste faint sweet, malty flavor.
"
1," Draft at Chattanooga location. Amber in the glass with a creamy white head that slowly settled and left light lacing. The aroma was of light malts. The flavor found spices and caramel. Light body, watery, and tingly carbonation.
"
1," MAR 9, 2008 ~Big airy, off white head. Thick brown cider like colour.	~Smells like spice, fruits, and malts.	~Flavor is fruity and spicy, cinnamon. Cant taste the alcohol content.	~Palate is very fizzy, similar to champagne. It sticks a little bit to the sides and the roof of my mouth. Warms my stomache. No bitterness	~ I had pretty high expectations for this beer since it received good ratings and is expenisive. I dont think its worth the high price.
"
1," Pours a dark reddish-brown color with a thick off-white head.  Aroma is of sweet malts, dried fruit, spices, and caramel.  Flavor starts off with the sweet malts that give way to the dried fruit and spices.  Flavor lingers awhile.  A pretty tasty brew but not my favorite from Chimay.
"
1," AUG 14, 2003 This is a very nice beer, but I am swayed by my high expectations. The aroma is nice, but somewhat weak, and the flavor is complex, but lacking in boldness. Very good, but not exceptional.
"
1," They just kept getting better and better. First red, then white, and now blue.  Dark brown color and a nice, fluffy white head.  Aroma was complex, as was the taste.  Spices, carmel, just a bit of alchol as it warmed.  Simply outstanding.
"
1," Bottle. Large sized tan head and fine-small sized bubbles that were mostly lacing. Uncarbonated, opaque and dark brown hue. Malty, wood, smokey, bourbon and roasted coffee aroma. Roasted coffee flavor with a burnt coffee aftertaste. Smooth palate. Good lacing.

"
1," A bit weak, roasted, berries. Flavor"
1," Aroma is sweet fruits with malts. Yellow/golden color, small white head that disappears fast, fair lace. Sweet, malty, bit chemical, medium body.
"
1," The Dunkel Bock is basically a supped up version of this breweries dunkel, quite malty with less diacetyl it seems, and the hop balance leans more towards the malt than even the dunkel does.  It is a bit darker more towards a brown, with notes of deep red.
"
1," Pours murky copper, with a somewhat fruity-yeasty aroma.  Starts with sourdough bread, caramel, alted milballs and sunshine.  Solid finish.  A nice belgian - but maybe a little too sour.
"
1," Nice use of spices in the aroma - it suggests gingerbread without overwhelming. Clear deep copper coloured body is topped by a decent white fine bubbled head that recedes to a lasting cover.  Quite sweet with obvious gingerbread flavours. Light offsetting bitterness. Medium full body is somewhat slick in texture with pleasantly pointy effervescence.  Really quite a nice suggestion of gingerbread without bludgeoning the tastebuds with the spices. Tulip glass. Cellar temperature. Bottle received as an ex-moose gift!  Thank you yellow pepper!
"
1," Cant believe Ive not rated this beer yet.  Pours a cloudy dark red with about half a finger of off-white soapy head.  Poured from a 750 ml into a Chimay chalice, I wanted to do this proper.  Roasted malts and some hint of dark fruit in the nose.  A little acidic, light mouthfeel, starts off with a little bit of sharp raisin, that eventually fades into a toasty hop aftertaste.  A solid trappist offering, but for my money, blue is the way to go.
"
1," MAR 29, 2004 Silky is the only word I can use to describe how it feels in your mouth.  I taste raisins, some spices, a little bit of pine, plums, and barely any alchohol.  One of my favorites still.
"
1," Hazy, muddy amber brown color with a filmy, soapy head.  I poured this out of a bottle I bought in Indianapolis, and it feels almost flat.  Thin, grainy nose.  Thin, watery body.  Some malt flavors, a little nuttiness, but not really much going on. Brown ales are hard to make special, and this one isn't.
"
1," Draught at the Charlotte Rock Bottom.  Light brownish red with a creamy light tan head that laces nicely.  Nutty brown and slightly hoppy aroma.  Flavor is largely dry malty with little hint of hops, not very sweet.  Medium bodied with a creamy consistency.  Finish is roast dryness.
"
1," bottle, thanks to bu11zeye,  very dark brown color with coffee colored head, nose is strong coffee, flavor has lots of chocolate, roasted malts and coffee notes, finish is nicely bitter
"
1," Light brown, cola-like colour with thin head.  Good nutty and coffee aromas with some malty sweetness.  Flavour is quite good, nutty and roasty with traces of cola flavour.  Good body with a bitter/astringent finish.
"
1," (swing top bottle) Hazy and murky brown colour with a fluffy off-white and stable foam. Dusty and yeasty, light-sweet wheat-malty aroma, slightly fruity (banana) with cola. Watery, light-bodied mouthfeel with medium carbonation. The taste is slightly wheaty and fruity; again with a touch of cola; slim and light-clovy finish. Not a very convincing Dunkelweizen.
"
1," Poured dark copper with a thick off white head with some almost unnoticeable sediment. Light yeasty floral aroma. Taste of raisin, prunes with some decent caramel thrown in for good measure. Warming alcohol finish.
"
1," Bottle, 33 cl. Cloudy amber colour with a thick off-white head. Spicy, yeasty & fruity aroma. Fruity flavour, perhaps with a tinge of alcohol.
"
1," Little bottle served at Shay McElroys Irish Pub in Houston.  Poured into a Chimay goblet.  Head appears and disappears quickly.  Its brown.  Lots of different smells and flavors.  I think that there are American versions of this style that are much better.
"
1," Solid IPA.  Has a more orange aftertaste than many IPAs I have had.  Not too hoppy at all.
"
1," From bottle poured dark copper color with a good amount of head.  Nice flavor with a lot of carbonation.
"
1," 12 oz. Clear shiny amber with a small head that flits away quickly. Malt, molasses and honey aroma. Flavor is roasted nut, light sourish honey, and chalky dry herb. Light body is slightly dry.
"
1," An absolutely marvelous beer. Although the smell was disappointingly mild, the rich great tasting flavor is excellent. It is strong and reminiscent of Bush, but has a subtlety that reminds me of Newcastle Brown Ale. It is superior to each of those beers in their own areas of expertise. There is a smoothness between foretaste to full-flavor and the resulting aftertaste. The change is not so wide as that famous one found in the English brew. Yet the superior flavor makes the subtle change an even more pleasant experience. There is a delicious combination of flavors tightly wound in an equally potent drink. Bush is wonderful. 12% with no overpowering alcohol taste. The Chimay Blue is no less potent. It is smoother and less bitter. It is similar in flavor, but more interesting and more refined. The other offerings from Chimay are all good. Their blue bottle is in another league. It is a genuine top class beer.
"
1," DEC 12, 2009 Pours murky brown with a small brown head. Good bretty nost with some dusty malt. Brett and some oak take the flavor to a really wonder full place. Medium full body with a dry finish. Really a super unexpected treat.
"
1," Pours a hazy brown with an average off white lightly lacing head.  Aroma of dark fruits, candy sugar and a bit floral. Flavor was yeasty, lightly fruity, nutty and a little metallic. A little thin.
"
1," Sample at the dubbel and quad tasting at Blacklick Wine & Spirits on 8/19/10. Hazy brown pour with a thick tan head. Nose is caramel, dark fruits and slight banana. Flavor starts with caramelly malt and booze, then smoothes out to dark fruit and a touch of banana.
"
1," Bottle. Unclear dark golden with small head. Malty - roasted bread flavor which i liked, well balanced. Thanks Papsoe

1," Decent (good wheat nose) however, was kind of boring (not much fruit/sweetnes)	-Appearance"
1," Bottle.  Pours a hazy, dark brown.  Small, off-white head.  Aroma of apples and some caramel.  Flavor is malty with a good bit of fruity notes.  Finish is nice and clean.  Well done.
"
1," Sweet,creamy lager. Slight skunk aftertaste.
"
1," Initial pour yields a crackling, bubbly head over an intriguing ruby-amber body.  Lightly yeasty aroma, offering a complex array of figs, dates, musky cologne, tanins, and carob.  Solid Belgian malt profile, candy sugar and bananas, and some pepper.  Lightly astringent, but the yeast pour softens it up a bit.  The dry finish lingers on very nicely.  Unfortunately, the very fizzy texture kept me from thoroughly enjoying an otherwise spectacular ale.
"
1," 28th August 2006  Warning! Early amateur rating! Bottle at the microbrew restaurant in Ljubljana. Comes accross like a wheat beer. Pronounced orange and citrus bitterness - pleasanty so. Clean finish. Refreshing.
"
1," Pour is dark hazy brown with fluffy white head.  Aroma is of fruit, raisins, heavy belgian spice, and is also sweet.  Flavor is again sweet and malty finishing with a slight raisin quality.  Good and refreshing brew.  Doesnt seem worth the price however.  May buy again.
"
1," Pours a dark burgandy with a frothy beige head.  A sweet aroma of fruit and spice.  The scents come through in the flavor with fruits and brown sugar.  The alchohol is noticable but not over powering.  Great all around dark Belgian.
"
1," I tasted 3 of the chimays at the same time and this was the best by far. good aroma, smooth and with a slight fruity, nutty, caramel undertones
"
1," Not much to say here except that this beer is underrated and delicious IMO.
"
1," Draft - Nashville. Deep brown color with off-white head. Overcarbonated. flavors seem to imediately disappear when they hit the tongue. Too much chlorine in supply water.
"
1," Cask Stillage at the GBBF, Earls Court 06/08/2009	Fruity aroma. Amber coloured and strong in alcohol with a crisp and slightly dry lasting fruity finish.
"
1," Dark pour from bottle.  Like many Belgian Ales, this is a strong one.  Roasted malt, warm and toasty, this one is strong yet smooth.  I love Chimay; all styles and all beers.
"
1," The after its disemboguing from the 500ml brown bottle the beer sets in the glass a slightly bemused amber color with a dinosauric head that is creamy in texture and a toothsome light tan in color, the lace a thick and glutinous blanket to obfuscate the glass. Nose has a definite malt sweetness with a bit of lime like tartness, quite crisp and clean, the start is lightly sweet with a pleasant malt profile, the top id middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is stern in its acidity, the hops are strong in the balance with the malt profile, quite dry and long lasting aftertaste, a style I sample rarely, and this bottle brought back from Germany by a co-worker, fresh from the brewery.
"
1," Bottle thanks to StFun, thanks man.  Poured an inky black color with a thin tan head that slowly disappeared.  Aroma is dominated by coffee, some roasted malt, and some light chocolate.  Nice sweet chocolate entry that leads into a roasty, coffee middle with light, sweet hints of fruit and a lingering coffee finish.  Full and smooth on the palate, but not real thick.  Really solid low alcohol stout, if it were available around here I wouldnt mind keeping a few in the fridge.  Thanks again StFun.
"
1," meaty port flavors, incredible head, strong yeast aroma.. very complex.. alcohol is very evident in a heart-warming finish.. will mellow you down.. Thanks to the brothers at Chimay for putting out such a high-quality product!
"
1," Machtig Brau Strong Ale. Dark brown brew foamy tan head. Nutty chocolate aroma. Flavor is bitter chocolate and sweet malt, very smooth, medium body with a bit of an oily feel and a nice warmth from the alcohol but without the alcohol taste. Very drinkable. I had 2 pints and took home a growler. Great brew!
"
1," On tap at the Seven Bridges brewpub in Jacksonville, FL and labelled as Seven Bridges American Red.  I had this beer with my lunch on the return trip from Disney, and oddly enough, this beers rating is almost eactly the same as the three beers I drank on the way down.  Anyway...arrived at the table a clear reddish amber with a moderate off-white head that faded to a ring at mid-glass and left a layer of foam with each sip.  Aroma of malt with a few notes of pine.  The flavor is malt up front followed by some pine and grapefruit.  If I were blindfolded, I would swear this was an east coast IPA and not a red ale.  Went well with my burger.
"
1," Cloudy dark golden lager with actual sediments in it. The smell is indeed a bit yeasty, but coming mostly bready which works quite well with the soft malts that display similar characteristics. Strawy, rather crisp, sweetish malts are tamed by a nicely slicing flowery bitterness. Strange with the yeast, but more than acceptable and one of the most pronounced hop bitterness in Slovenia I presume.
"
1," Bottle courtesy of stfun.  Pours dark brown with a tan head.  Smells of coffee and caramel.  Tastes of chocolate, touches of coffee, a cup of joe like finish.  Meh.
"
1," Bottle, served in a Chimay glass. A dark brown colour with a small head. Aroma is malty and sweet. Taste is very malty with chocolate and bread/yeast.Very sweet. Moderate carbonation. Too sweet for my liking.
"
1," Pours a hazy copper color with an off white head. Aroma, citrus, floral, and some spicy hops, bready pale malts. Flavor, caramel, some spice, a bit bready, with a slight bitterness.
"
1," Pours cloudy yellow, fluffy white head. Just a good very easy drinking summer beer. Nice lemon citrus flavor to it with some banana and very slight spiciness, nothing to brag about but not bad in any way, pretty good.
"
1," loads of warming bourbon, milk chocolate, and toasty oak and vanilla; the bourbon and oakiness is a bit beyond the chocolatey, light stout underneath; but theres really nothing overly harsh or astringent here, surprisingly; a warming, reasonably tasty milk chocolate stout.  Medium finish, toasty oak, vanilla, soft bourbon and wood, with plenty of chocolate.
"
1, spicy mostly of corriander. Flavor
1," 750 ml bottle.  Pours dark brown with a small light-tan head, appears cloudy and coppery when held to bright light.  Fruity, complex aroma - raisins, grapes, yeast and caramel malts.  Flavor is sweet and rich with that distinctive Belgian yeastiness.  Very noticible alcohol as well.  Mouth feel is medium-full bodied, but a little too much carbonated foaminess, rather than a really enjoyable creaminess.
"
1," Brown to amber with a small off-white head. Aroma of malt and bread with a fruity touch. Sweet and fruity flavour with some caramel and noticable alcohol.
"
1," Bottle.  Medium dark brown opaque pour.    Weak bourbon aroma, with some alcohol and maybe a woody/earthy hint.  Medium roasty malt flavors, with bourbon and chocolate.  Way too carbonated and not at all oatmeal-stout-creamy.  A little thin too.
"
1," Medium Brown color, medium head. Nice malts, some hoppyness. &#8220;Honey brewed&#8221; there is a slight sweetness. Nice malt/hop balance. Mouthfeel is full. Mild taste, good flavor. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter, with just a touch of sweetness.
"
1," Amber coloured, smaller loose off-white head, relatively slowly collapsing; sweetish-caramelly nose with a tinge of vanilla and cinnamon; light to moderate bitter-sweetish flavour, almost medium bodied; slightly lingering, perhaps solid bitter and dark-malty finish with a herbal aftertaste. Good X-mas brew......
"
1," DEC 9, 2009 Bottle. 25.4 oz. Split with Sean. Pours deep, hazy chesnut brown with a tall, full finger beige head. Aroma of figs, cinnamon, apples, caramel, booze, and hints of roasted malts and chocolate. Fuller bodied with a very smooth, sweet mouthfeel. Crisp, tangy, slow finish. Very well known and deservedly so; Chimay Blue is always reliably great. Highly recommended.
"
1," OCT 10, 2006 A good beerfrom belgium. many complex layers of flavor, a head that lasts for years, very open and warm on the palate, rich oak balanced against sweet apricot.  Delicious.
"
1," This Belgian pours a dark reddish brown with a small head. Very fruity to the nose with scents of ripe grapes and figs? Peppery to the nose, maybe a little cider vinegar. First sip was sharp with carbonation.  Flavours of wine and slight vinegar with lots of ripe fruit. Some roasty flavours. The finish is yeasty and a little bitter/sour with flavours of citrus coming through. The finish ends with a small bitterness and of coarse the yeast flavours of a Belgian Ale. Belgian ales arent my favourite but this ones not too bad.
"
1,"	Fieldberries and diplomatic caramel coexist peacefully, while earthy, leafy hops gather to conclude this super clean Scotch Ale.		Further Personal Perceptions"
1," Clear golden body with a small frothy off-white head. Sweet grainy malt aroma. Sweet malty flavor with light grassy hops.
"
1," NOV 9, 2006 It pours slightly hazy with a mostly lasting light brown creamy head.  Aroma is moderatly malty like toasted bread, slightly hoppy and lightly doughy.  Flavor is a almost perfect balance of sweet and bitter with a short finish.  Medium bodied creamy, livley with a slightly chalky finish.
"
1," Pretty good.
"
1," JUN 6, 2006 Pours lighter than the Bleue, taste and scent is not as strong - a softer version i think, similar in taste but subtler and perhaps less complex. Very easy to drink, very nice.
"
1," Cork almost made my friend single again, and quite possibly compromised the structural integrity of his apartment.  This was just magical.  First beer of the night!  Amore!  Cloudy amber, excellent head and head retention.  Wonderful maltiness and a creamy mouthfeel.  I didn't find it too astringent.  It had an aftertaste of fresh-baked bread.  I am SO thankful for the peer pressure on this site, or I never would have discovered this!  Forgot to mention, the 7%ABV was masterfully hidden.  I had no idea till I looked!
"
1," Chimay blue holds a special place in my heart, as it was the first strong Belgian Ale that I have ever tried. When I first tried it, I did not know what to think, but understood immediately that this was a quality beer. The taste was a little too strong and the alcohol was overwhelming. However, when returning to America I picked up the 75cl bottle and drank it at a punk show. Not only did I feel more dignified, but in contrast to all the malt liquor in the room, I finally grasped the full goodness of this beer. The taste was rich, sweet and creamy. Every sip of the beer was excellent and when the bottle was finished, I regretted that I had to begin drinking a lower quality beer and lamented nostalgically on the excellent beer consumed.
"
1," Big dark, fruity belgian ale.  Darker then Premire and more complex.
"
1," Pours a dark cloudy ruby brown, with a large tan head that mostly lasts and laces in sheets.  Aroma is fruity (raisin, plum), some yeastiness, sweetness, and a bit of caramel and/or toffee.  Flavor is sweet, fruity, vinous, some honey, and some spiciness in the finish.  Full bodied, slight hints of alcohol towards the end.
"
1," This wasn't a bad beer.  A little fruity in the aroma, a full mouth-feel in the finish.  And the flavor was somewhat mild and yeasty.
"
1," Cask Stillage from the Jug at the GABF, Colorado Convention Center 24/09/2009	Very fruity bourbon aroma. Dark coloured strong in alcohol and very fruity with a little spiced flavour. A hint of dryness in a bitter malt finish.
"
1," Thanks to JCB for sharing. Pours a dark brown with a light tan head. The nose is rusty, grainy, chocolate, mild coffee, earthy. The flavor is a tad watery, mildly chocolaty, roasty, some yeast character.
"
1," 50 cL bottle. Pours clear and golden yellow with a huge white head. Aroma is grassy and light cornish. Sweet malty, cornish and slight syrupy flavoured. Bitter and slight acidic finish.
"
1," This beer pours a dark honey brown in the middle, a lighter candy apple red towards the edges and a light gold and cherry around the very edges of my glass. The head is a soft tan film that is instantly revitalized with a swirl.		Smells of honey and pastry dough with a slight walnut and a light carbon dioxide sour sting. Theres also a little bit of alcohol that drifts through, especially when it warms.		Tastes of gooey pastry dough, honey and again, the light CO2 like sting. In the finish a dry mossy oak makes its self known. After a few seconds, a dry and nutty honey flavor is left lingering on my tongue.		The mouth feel is extremely light and it tends to sting just a little. 		Very tasty. I wouldnt mind having a case of this lying around.
"
1," 330 ml bottle. Finland.	Very dark hazy brown with massive fluffy head. Yesterday I tasted the Triped (Blanche) and I was expecting something even better. Well, I do not know. I think Tripel was more flavoured. Here is a more alcohol present. Still excellent!
"
1," Scent of citrus and other fruits.  Fairly strong hop flavor, however, this flavor is only average compared to other IPAs.  This also means the beer is not as dry as most IPAs, which is a plus for me.  Aside from the hops, there is really no other flavor present.  If I am going to go through the bitterness of this IPA, I would like there to be more to it.  But there isnt.
"
1," On tap at the Disney World Boark Walk location. Poured a lighter, and see through (clear) straw color with a small sized white head. Aromas and tastes of light grass. Thin and watery.

1," milky white with chunky legs.  nose is coconut, roasted almonds, and light alcohol.  very chunky on the palate, flavor is roasted nuts, milk, and florals.
"
1," carbonated. Tasting raisins and prunes. Aftertaste is alcoholic bitter.
"
1," Deep, cloudy brown with a light brown head. Sweet caramel-fruit nose, some brown sugar. Complex, dark fruits - fig, date, raisin. Gets even more complex as it warms in the glass, the malts and caramel come through. Smooth mouthfeel. The best of the style that is widely available, IMHO.
"
1," Obtained 23-Sep-05 in trade with atpayne, thanks Adam!) A loud ""pffft"" and explosive head had me worried right out of the gate that I let this possibly infected beer age too long, but this is a very delicious beer.  Moderate roast and light chocolate are enhanced by a pleasant earthy and mushroom flavor early, but also by the wonderful, sweet bourbon character throughout.  I think the bourbon is done perfectly here; its prominent but not dominant and nowhere close to being overwhelming, allowing the roast and other malty flavors plenty of opportunity to express themselves.  A little more roastiness wouldnt hurt though.  The nose is less impressive though because the roast is quite light, and the pleasantness of the moderate bourbon aroma is offset by a slight smell of apple skins.  Body is medium-full and far less carbonated than I expected given the glassful of head I got on the pour.  Dark brown in color with all sorts of tan specs slowly settling to the bottom of the glass.  Each pour results in mostly a glass of head, so it takes several pours to finish this beer, and even on the final pour, the head is unrelenting.  Tan in color, becoming mountainous with peaks and valleys as it begins to slowly settle down to a centimeter in height.  Thick, chunky foam sticks to the glass.  Except for the annoying carbonation issues and the modest apple skin in the aroma and flavor, this is a very enjoyable and tasty bourbon beer.

1," ""This was my first Chimay, and I have to admit that I was dissapointed. It pours a nice dark brown color with a hint of orange or red. The head was thin, a very slight tan color to it. The aroma was spicy and fruity at the same time. Maybe a pear aroma mixed in with the spices. The mouthfeel was nice, very full and definitely complex. I tasted a mostly floral type of taste with the spices overpowering any of the fruity flavors involved. It has a slightly bitter aftertaste. Very drinkable, but not all I expected after hearing so much about this beer.""
"
1," Poured an amber brown body filled with particles, all under an average tan head. Smelled of lightly roasted malts and grains, and some hoppy herbs and grass. Nice taste of slightly sour apples, moving to the bitter grass and roses youd expect from the hops, a nice spice throughout. Average on the palate, slightly oily texture. Ill stick with Chimay Blue unless Im looking for the hop bite.
"
1," Dark brown.   Little head, A lot of tastes pop as I drink this one. Carbonated, smooth, hides the alcohol burn well.
"
1," Great beer and everything I expect out of a belgian strong ale; actually preferred this beer to Trois Pistoles and Westy 12 although it didnt stand the test next to its bigger brother, the Chimay Blanche.  Great copper color, medium body and head, suprising fruity aroma and palate - perhaps due to the properties of the yeast used in creating this fine beer.  Great balance between alcohol,carbonation and flavor.  Look out for the chunk of sediment waiting for you at the bottom of the bottle.
"
1," Dark color but with the same nose as its bretheren. Although similiar to th Red Label, it does have a deeper alcohol note and feeling especially in the back of the mouth. Not as much yeast at the rest but still noticible. Balanced spicy-fruity overtones. I still prefer the Red but its a supreme ale nonetheless.
"
1," damn, i had this almost a yr ago but was too lazy to add it till now.  Definetely one of the best of the sampler i enjoyed at the brewery. It was very black with some decent coffee hints. the body was decent, but a bit watery, just not bold enough to hang with the bigguns.
"
1," 07.26.04  750ml Bottle.  Indeed, a reddish brown pour with a frothy and thick head.  Aromas of banana, milk chocolate, fruit salad, apricot.  Flavors are mild and pleasant, quite fruity and fresh.  Somewhat tinny(?) before a nicely dry finish.  Ive had a few liters of this stuff over the years.  Its a bit pricey, but always reliably consumable.
"
1," Pours nice dark, cloudy brown with a big light tan head. Aroma is slightly yeasty with sweet candied dark fruit in the background. The flavor is a more pronounced version of the aroma. Strong raisin/date flavor, slight sweetness with a little yeast. The alcohol is warming going down but is not overpowering and does not detract from the flavor.
"
1," Pours a dark amber with a thick off-white head.  Sweet aroma of dark fruits, floral, and caramel.  Flavor is sweet with dark fruits to start off then finishes with the caramel and a small hint of floral. A slight alcohol warming is the perfect ending to this brew, All the flavors and aromas blend well to make this trappist very delicious.
"
1," The Budweiser of Belgian Trappist Ales...ok, thats selling it short, but this beer is everywhere. Taste is Belgian yeast, dark fruit, and a little sweet malt.  Nice complexity.  Medium-bodied, tending a little towards the full side.
"
1," After finding three of the seven trappist ales available at my local Carrefour I indulged about bought one of each. Given its reputation, I decided to start with the Chimay Bleue in a 33cl bottle. I was not disappointed. 	It poured a dark and cloudy chocolate/caramel color into the glass and left a creamy head which did not disappear right away, but left an enjoyable froth on the sides of my glass.	It had a much fruitier fragrance than I expected given its strength and color with yeast in for good measure. I actually found my mouth water when i wafted it in.	Again, its flavor surprised me. I have tried my fair share of beer at and over 9% apv and I usually find them overpowering but not this one. It had good dried fruit and bread/grains to the palate with a pleasant malt without the over powering sensation of a high alcohol content. It finished a mild bitter and left me swirling, smelling and sipping until it was done. I did not want to gulp it at all, which in this case was a good thing. 	Given that I am new to the Trappist beers I may have to come back to this review at some point in the future. I am not, however new to Belgian beers and this is one fine example of a good strong Belgian Ale. Undoubtedly worth a try by anyone who loves beer.
"
1," A dark beer with little head. Strong coffee bitterness with a mild sweetness, akin to day-old coffee. This could use some hops to remind you that it is beer, but it isnt bad.
"
1," Dark brown muddy body with amber/ruby glints. Average off-white bubbly/frothy head. Complex yeasty nose with fruity (mainly raisin and dark cherries) and flowery hints. Texture is relatively smooth, and taste is perfectly balanced. It is mainly sweet/fruity, but has also nice yeasty and hoppy notes, especially in the finish. Altough alcohol remains well hidden for a 9% alc. beer, each mouthful leaves a pleasant warming effect. That beer has a very good reputation, and it deserves it entirely. Thats why I selected it as my 300th rated beer!
"
1," Fresh and creamy, as if from the tap today. A great super-creamy malt with some bitters and dried aftertaste. A bit of citrussy banana fruit and spice but not taking away from its simplicity.
"
1," Pours a rich, reddish ochre, with a faint nose of yeast, malt, and honeyed-fruit,  though with a quickly disappearing head. Full on the palate, very pleasant blend, and making up on the palate for what it lacks elsewhere, thereby delivering a memorable beer.
"
1," Red light blue light red light blue....I love you...Stompin in the yard is like having a glass with some class with this fine spec-im-ine.
"
1," if complexity is the measure by which beers are rated, then the chimay three colour range must be up amongst the best. The bleu in my eyes is the pick of the crop. perhaps it was just the batch I had, but the head was lacking instrength coompared to some other trappistes style beers
"
1," Served properly in a Trappist Glass in Aikmans, St Andrews, UK. Really nice appearance, dark body, perfectly proportioned head, lasted. Roasted hops in the aroma. Good drinker, little too sweet for my liking, probably to disguise the alcohol. Like a dark ale youd expect from a great English brewer. Caramel and sweet malts. I tried to drink this slow, but it was still even too sweet. Good beer if you dont mind sweeter beers.
"
1," Good beer.  Nowhere near as good as the Kid Rock concert I just got back from!  Damn that was good!  Best concert Ive seen in a while.
"
1," Beer poured with a creamy, mostly lasting off white head.  Good lacing.  Nose of toasted raisin/plum and grain.  Inital flavor was lighly sweet and lightly acidic.  Finish had more intense sweetness and lightly bitter with long duration.  Also had moderate alcoholic bite, but it wasnt overly pronounced.  Overall this is a very balanced beer.  I would have another one any day!
"
1," Very dark brown color and a large, thick head. Aroma was not particularly distinct. Flavor was strong, with red grapes and very little bitterness in the finish. Overall a fantastic strong ale, one of my all time favorites.
"
1," Wonderful witbier spiced with orange peels. Thirst quenching bit still complex.
"
1," DEC 31, 2008 pours deep brown with a nice head that lasts for much of the way down the glass. aroma of light hops, malt, and spice.  flavor is very well balanced"

"
1," Thanks to Tytoanderso for the this bottle!		Pours a thick, oily black with a nice big tan head.  Smell is roasty dark malt, cream, and faint sweetness.  Touch too thin in the bodied for a stout, but the flavor is nice, and roasty.  Not burnt or overly done, and very drinkable.  Nice beer.
"
1," Poured like a dream, with a beautiful head. I was really excited to taste it, but upon first taste I was baffled by the fruity wine taste. Maybe I'm just not a fan of the style or perhaps I'm too young and inexperienced, but I did not like the Chimay. The abbaye des Rocs Grand Cru was better. I am however, looking forward to trying a Rochforte 10 and the coveteed Westy Abt. 12. I hope I see waht the rest of the ratebeerians see in these beers someday.
"
1," 05/03 on the cork.		Pours a rich auburn with a frothy light tan head. Smell is fruity, caramel malt, lightly bitter, candy sugar/molasses.		Taste is again that rich fruity and caramel malt. Lightly spicy. A bit overcarbonated but that fades as it warms. Rich and smooth. A bit sticky mouth especially in the aftertaste.		Not overly complex but surprisingly good.
"
1," have been drinking this one for 10 years.  Alcohol fairly well hidden to me, nice sweet flavor with touches of malt and spices.  Always a favorite...
"
1," Amber brown color with an off-white head that remains. A yeasty, malty nose. Mix of hazelnut, floral perfume and a hint vanilla. Malty and yeasty with caramel final. Strong alcohol % that you dont taste. Very nicely done. Ok its a Chimay. Do I want to be a monk? Well...
"
1," Gold w/ white head.  Grassy hop aroma.  Pretty mediocre pale lager.  Nothing too special...although its better than any macro.  Notes of barley malt, grassy hops and something like black pepper on the finish.  It is what it is...a easy drinking clean lager.  Ok everyday drinking brew. Wont buy again though...there are P.L.s I enjoy more.
"
1," Bottle. Clear golden, average white head. Aroma and flavour of scorched toast and caramel, no true honey flavours for me though. Yes its sweet, but more from the caramel.
"
1," Another good belgian brew.		Pour is a dark, cloudy amber color. The head forms up nice and lasted a while. The smell is a little light, compared to the other Chimays. Taste is good, crisp and you can feel the carbonation just enough. Very good brew, just not my favorite of the style.
"
1," no doubt about it, this belgium brew is a great pairing with all types of dishes whether meat or fruit.  Nice taste, darkish pour, light on the palate, little aftertaste.  An original.  Might be heavy for some.  Higher than usual ALC content.  Cheers!
"
1," sweet (a bit fruity) but not syrupy, spicy, with a more bitter and dry finish.
"
1," Cask conditioned - gravity - Flower Pot Derby.  A dark brown coloured beer.  The aroma has some fruity notes but there is not a lot going on.  The taste is quite sweet and malty with some berry fruit tastes.  Quite nice.
"
1," Getting notebook online. Bottle. The last of the three from my gift set. Very malty and sweet. Still good amounts of Belgium yeast flavors. A slight hint of apricot as well. Pretty good.
"
1," Pours a nice cloudy brown/slight orange tint, with lots of fluffy head which quickly dissipates with no lacing. aroma is of toasted grains, fruit, and some yeast. Flavor is of fermented grains and fruit, unique yeast flavor is present. A little more carbonated than I would have liked, but I like the strong initial flavor of the fruits and grains.
"
1,	Body
1," [500ml bottle, Hebridean Brewery] Pours highly carbonated clear golden colour. Malty aromas  which continue on the palate. Long bitter finish, which is dry and pretty harsh. The aftertaste is astringent and almost aniseed from the bitter malt, although after a while this fades and the beer becomes more sessionable. Not sure Id want to, however [15042009]
"
0," JAN 7, 2008 First off, this is NOT a Marzen. Way too dark, and WAY to strong a roast character for the style. Strongly phenolic in aroma and flavor, which greatly overpowers any positive malt or hop character. Phenolic character most likely is from wild yeast infection, although in another beer the brewer claims it is from cloves. Why would anyone put cloves in a marzen? Pours clear, with a nice off-white head. I strongly doubt the claims of alcohol level. It is very likely 6-8 % at most.
"
1," FEB 18, 2006 Very dark red/black beer in the porter style. Authentically dry and definitely, as the brewery suggests, has caramel overtones. However, whilst this was a respectable effort - and anyone who has the balls to set up a micro in the previously real ale desert of the Outer Hebrides and manages to get it shipped to London deserves full marks for effort - I found this a little thin and with insufficient complexity to merit very high marks. Nonetheless, very pleasant and a style that is not too common these days, so deserves every encouragement. The Speaker, London SW1, September 2003.
"
1," Cloudy like mus pour with a nice head. Very dry. Not my style but the wife likes it.
"
1," A light orange beer with a disappearing off-white head. The aroma is corny and malty, while the flavor is sweet malty combined with powerful notes of corn, and a slightly hoppy finish.
"
1," JUN 6, 2006 An amazing Belgian beer considered how mass produced it is. With its wide availability I often have one of these with me no  matter where im at. Not quite as deep as some other belgians but very tasty! Yeasty and musky flavors come through in a nice way. Good dark fruity flavors are present. To me it also has a little bit of a chocolate milk, or maybe a cocoa flavor in there, too. Massive rocky head that you would expect from a belgian. Lacing is beautiful - like a well woven spider-web down my entire glass. I always buy this one thinking that I only need one because of its ABV, but always wish I would have bought two. Drink it warm-ish like you would most Belgians of this style, but dont let it get too warm, the alcohol becomes more present in both the nose and the flavor.
"
1," Bottle conditioned. Poors a dark reddish coloured beer with a big lasting head. Nice lacing, and in the nose, sweet aromas of malts with raisins and hints of caramel.The taste is sweet with raisins, some alcohol, well hidden, and hints of pepper. Medium bodied, extremely well balanced. In the final we have cloves, pepper and hints of caramel. What a fantastic beer.
"
1," FEB 21, 2011 The best of the Chimay. I have had the red and white also. Even though they are a treat this is the Crown of the the three. Definitely strong and gratifying to the eye. Full bodied with an incessant finish. I recommend this one.
"
1," Much better to my tastes than the sweeter red label. Lovely brown color, best as it approaches room temp.
"
1," Another clear favourite. Typical Belgian, very strong but not too overly alcoholic...
"
1," Good, but does not live up to its reputation.  I would prefer a more substantial mouthfeel and complexity.  Pleasurable to drink, but not my favorite.
"
1," Pours a cloudy amber with a creamy head which evaporates into ample lacing. Aromas of molasses cookies and brown sugar. Sweet up front dry then a lingering coffee like finish. Good brown along the lines of Dogfish Heads Indian Brown, but I prefer Dogfish Heads rendition.
"
1," JUL 3, 2009 Disney Boardwalk. On Tap. I always find it hard to get excited for a lite beer, but the Florida heat on this day was oppresive, and something quenching and uncomplicated was on the menu. Light wheaty nose with subtle breadiness balanced the floral lightly hopped body. Thin and smooth with a slightly dry finish, this is a decent, if not exceptional beer. Certainly better then anything else you can get at Disney beer-wise.
"
1," Truly one of the worlds greatest beers. Spicy with deep rich flavours this beer is simply magnificent
"
1," Muddy brown, maybe orange with lots of yeast particles. Aroma is of sweet malts. Tastes like bitter chocolate. Alcohol slightly noticeable. Not very complex taste but good nonetheless.
"
1," Love this beer! The balance of malty sweet and dark fruit is perfect. So smooth in the mouth, one of the greats.
"
1," 12 oz. bottle via trade with decaturstevo - Pours a clear reddish-amber color with a 1/2 finger thick off white head.  Very light lacing.  Aroma is toasted caramel malt and light citrus. Flavor is basicly the same.  Palate is slightly bitter and has a slight astringent aftertaste.  A decent Amber ale.  Thanks Steve.
"
1," I enjoyed pouring this beer into my newly acquired Chimay Glass.  JUst felt right...Not much to add about this fantastic dubbel...Nearly perfect for the style..Nicely played

1," Bottle. Tangy with a zip of citrus and a hit of banana. Smooth and quite sweet. Flavours of fudge and brown sugar faint but definately present. Long tingly finish.

1," very crisp,hints of fruit and spices,somewhat light colored but not light in taste, alot of carbonation in this bottle, but not always like that,so I hear
"
1," Provides a dark brown color, a head a flat as a board with a heavy, but succulent sweet caramel, toffeish Crunchie chocolate bar nose.  The palate is has soft caramel over laying strong brownies and a mildly bitter finishes with hints of chocolate and caramel.
"
1," I was at cocktail party where they were making a making a drink that involved Glenmorangie Scotch and Chimay Blue, lemon juice, and maple and blackberry syrup.  It was very tasty but after 3 of them I asked for Chimay straight up.  Ive passed by so many times in grocery store so for free finally get the rate.  Pours dark amber with thick beige head.  Tastes of sweet malt, raisins, brown sugar, and caramel.  Very tasty indeed.
"
1," Ok light but I do not like lights.light and clear with not much head. No aroma and the flavor is of some malt but not much hops.
"
1," Pours like coffee, deep black core with dark brown highlights around the rim of the glass.  The head starts healthy, but settles into a skim after a few sips.  The nose really reminds me of a brown ale - notes of toffee, flat caramel and semi-sweet chocolate are abound.  The belgian yeast adds some light, fruity esthers that add an interesting dimension.  The body is chewy with an onslaught of sweet malts.  Notes of caramel and baked brown initially hit the tongue.  The yeast takes on a bigger role here, adding deep fruits, overripe banana, plums and more.  Drinks well and has an interesting complexity.
"
1," Dark brown colour.Nice head,Malty taste dry and nice finish.Great trapipistes beer.Very long after taste.Bit over rated maybe because of name.I tried a 2004 bottle.
"
1," Very thick and hazy with lots of yeast sediment. Excelent flavoring for an Abby double. I still liked the tripple bettter.
"
1," 75cl bottle. Orange colour with a red hue. Small white head. Aroma is sweet malts, almost too much as well as fruits. Flavour is belgian yeast. Lots of sweet notes, sweet malts, sugar, caramel and hints of hops. Short aftertaste.
"
1," 2006 bottle from LCBO in a sampler pack.  This is a truly wonderful beer.  A similar taste to the Chimay Rouge, but much stronger, and more of an alcohol finish.  The light floral quality from the Rouge is much more obvious with the Bleue.  Id agree with others that this beer could benefit from a few years of aging.  As it gets warmer, it gets a little bit too sharp. Its certainly not an everyday drinker like the Rouge could be, but its much more complex, and much more of a treat, like a dark chocolate would compare to a chocolate bar.  Either way, I strongly suggest this as a must try!
"
1," Draft. Pours dark amber with a thick tan head. Sweet, roasted malt aroma. This beer is sweet and malty with a subtle hop flavor. Slightly bitter finish. Decent beer. A
"
1," Red label, red beer, big white foamy head. A really nice dubbel, but without the sweetness a lot of them have. Slightly watery, but a great brown bread finish. Got this at the local Albert Heyn supermarket. Too bad the aroma isnt great, otherwise it would be a lot higher
"
1," A - apple, chocolate and caram	A - mid gold with thick head	T - sour and sweet	P - mid and soft	O - too sour
"
1," Aroma is hittin with grassy hops and some nuttyness. Taste is similar, but something is unbalanced, maybe not at its best.
"
1," 330ml Bottle.  Second in my three beer Chimay vertical.  Pours a murky brown with one finger beige head and light lacing.  Nose is light fruits, malt and Belgian spices.  Taste is cloves, sweet fruits and malt with a yeasty finish.  Medium mouth feel.  I actually liked the taste a bit better than the blue  not as cloying, yet not nearly as complex.
"
1," AUG 31, 2008 This is the one for me.  A great amalgamation of flavor, aroma, creaminess, complexity, cloudy rusted metal suspended particles, good alcohol.  This is the brew to have have if you can have only one.
"
1," 12 oz. bottle. $1.60 single @ Binnys. Nice chocolatey smell in the bottle neck. Also in the glass, with no sourness like a regular stout, nor alcohol. Tan colored head atop a opaque black body. Taste is very smooth as befits an oatmeal stout. Dark malts without the bitter ""roastiness."" Malt is thick and sticky on my lip. Again, alcohol in moderation here. Easy to take down with no ill effects.I would wish this had secondary fermentation instead of carbonation for an even smoother texture, but its wonderful just as it is.
"
1," Mon premier Chimay que j,ai bu, mailleur que la blanche, car je la trouve moin amre et plus riche; un peu sucr et caramelis.
"
1," From bottle, pours a rich brown with good head. Flavor is robust and strong. My least favorite of the Chimays.
"
1," JAN 8, 2007 1pt 9.4oz corked bottle (11/05 vintage) from Hy-Vee Liquors poured into trappist glass - Pours very deep burgundy with a 1 finger tan head; Fruit (grapes, and blackberry most notably), malt, and a little alcohol to the nose; Not the most complex, but very pleasing; Same fruits from the aroma, malt, yeast, some type of spice, and a hint of the alcohol and floral hops (only if you chew on it a little) on the initial taste; A slight floral hop presence along with a roasted malt note and raisin on the backtaste; A good medium palate; A little high on the carbonation; Felt fizzy at times, but died down after a while; Very nice effort by the monks from Chimay. Now I interested in how this would cellar. The initial blast of carbonation kept the palate score from being 5, but maybe it was just this bottle. I sure Il find out sometime!
"
1," 12 oz bottle thanks to tytoanderso.  Pours a brown black with a fizzy brown head.  Really roasty nose at first.  This mellows to more chocolate and sweet malts.  Fizzy carbonation, watery body.  Chocolate, roast, sweet oats in the flavor.  Finishes with burnt roasted malts.  The sweetness is counteracted nicely with the roast, but overall theres nothing too special.
"
1," Draft in Jacksonville. The one there is 4.5% not 5.6% as listed here. 	<P>	The aroma is a massive dose of chocolate and coffee with accompanying burnt/toasted dark malt notes. The body is full on black and holds a lasting mocha head. Huge coffee component, dark chocolate. Very smooth mouthfeel and clean with well defined flavor demarcations. Nice.
"
1," Bottle shared at Pauls Thanksgiving weekend bash. Poured a dark brown body with a super foamy beige head. Aroma was complex with notes of sweet chocolate, honey, toast, earth, licorice, and some dark nicotine. The palate is wrong with a thin watery body hidden underneath a strong bubbly carbonation. Flavor of burnt dark chocolate, cake batter, bitter hops, light licorice, toast and celery. Meh.....not a fan.
"
1," Cask gravity at Kent BF 2006.  Down as Island Strong at 4.8%, but I am pretty sure that this is the same beer as Islander.  Hazy russet with thin off white head. Raisiny aroma with some off flavours in mouth.  Some grapefruit hop on end.  Syrupy red fruit.  Quite malty.

1," bottle that is labeled Big River Red Ale, but mentions Rocket Red from the Disney location.  Pours amber red with a thin white head.  Hints of citrus hops in the nose but also a lot of crystal malts, sweet, sugary aromas.  Somewhat hoppy, has a good bite, some sweet malts, and some citrus hop flavors, with a slight toasty finish.   Not bad, easy drinking, but nothing special.
"
1," Bottled. A hazy deep red beer with a thin beige head. The aroma has notes of sweet malt, alcohol, and caramel. The flavor is sweet with notes of alcohol, fruit, and caramel, leading to a dry alcoholic finish. The body is thick. Thanks KimJohansen for sharing.

1," Bottle.  Poured into snifter.  Pour is reddish brown with a dark white head.  Malt aroma, and the taste is perfectly roasted malt.  get a touch of almost wood / whisky in the finish.  Fantastic complexity, and extremely drinkable.
"
1," SEP 23, 2009 Solid all around. Pours a creamy orange, nice thing head, great lacing. Aroma is citrus, slightly metallic, with the ""funk"" that MI2CA mentioned. Flavor is mostly smooth, but with a great bitter bite that adds nicely. Lots of grapefruit in this one actually. Its a great addition to an IPA. The body is nice and thick, never too watery. A great balance of flavors going on too, nice malty notes with delicious citrus fruits dancing around. Not as strong as a Dreadnaught or 90min, but this has a lot of character to make up for it. This beer is awesome, I wish like hell theyd sell it in growlers (or bottle it).
"
1," on tap. Pours a rather dark brown. It almost looks like a porter. The head retention is commendable. In the aroma I find hints of toasty almonds, caramel, and bread. The flavor is decent, nothing too interesting. Its a standard brown ale with more flavors of nuts, caramel, toast. I pry a little deeper and find a hint of cola, wood, and maybe even a little chocolate. This stuff is all right.
"
1," NIc,e interesting, dark in colour,m very strong and very alcoholic. The foam is great, reminds me some sugar.
"
1," DEC 26, 2005 Aroma of banana and bubblegum is the first that comes to mind.  Somewhat roasty with yeast showing quite a bit as well on the tongue.  Slight alcohol tinge.  Nice indeed.
"
1," Pours a cloudy brown with no head. Lots of sediment in the bottle. A bit of mellow sweetness in the nose. Nothing particularly wrong with it, just not a whole lot to get excited about. Complexity leaves something to be desired. Rather a bland, boring beer. Was expecting something much bette for $4 a bottle.
"
1," Points for the fact that we can get it here. More for the fact that it wasn't skunky through light strike or bottle age. Having said that it was just a lager, not much of a pilsener character. Well presented like most beers that are reasonably fresh. Clean palate without being brilliant.

"
1," 330mL bottle, Chimay glass. Pours opaque brown, sediment being lifted up by the carbonation. Light aroma of very ripe fruit and alcohol. Beautiful burst of fruity flavours right up front, Chewy mouthfeel, sweet, spicy and slightly alcoholic finish. Wonderful, warms you right up, too bad its summer!
"
1," awesome beer...unbelievably unique
"
1," Nice head, some bubble gum and spice can be detected in the aroma. Not as full flavored as its brothers and the body seems a bit lacking, thinner somehow. Finishes like tea, bittering and coating the tounge with a chalky residue. Not my favorite Chimay.
"
1," Mmmm.  Near perfection.  Full bodied and rich but with a lightness and carbonation unique to the strong ales.  Sweet and flowery at the end.  First had this in Baton Rouge with my parents on a research trip in 2005.
"
1," 50 cL bottle, courtesy of Papsoe/Timo. Pours hazy orange with a small white head. Aroma dry estery and wheaty aroma. Dry wheaty, light fruity and mild acidic. Distinct estery flavoured. Bitter and acidic estery flavoured finish.
"
1," Bottle looks very good, nice wax seal on the bottle. The label doesnt say IPA but the desription on the website hopfen-fluch.de refers to the story about IPA. I guess the ""normal"" German would not know what an IPA is, thats why they left it out and called it ""Helle Starkbier Spezialitt"". Cork hard to remove. Beer in the glass very zippy, huge head. Starts very, very hoppy, extrem dry and bitter, some light lemon notes. Finish woody and metallically, sourish, still very dry and bitter. The beer doesnt really taste like an IPA, more like a very bitter pils. I really appreciate the try to create a, for German standards, unusual beer, but this is not really well done. But I hope Wernecker continues to experiment with unusal beerstyles!
"
1," Bottled. Brown in colour. Minor white head. It has a fryuity aroma with an alcoholic scent. The fllavour is fruity and yeasty with a sweet taste. Great!

1," Zu Beginn ist eine weiche Hopfigkeit vorhanden, die mit erdig-nussigen Gewrztonen berzeugen kann. Dazu kommen im Mittelteil herbe Noten, die aber nur ergnzend wirkend und einzeln eher unwichtig sind. Erst zum Ende hin wird die Herbe strker, unterliegt aber auch hier dem weiterhin erdnussartigen Hopfen. Frisch, sffig und rund, im Nachgeschmack ser, wodurch das Bier vollmundiger wirkt. Leicht grasig. Gelungen! 9/10/11/11/6/11
"
1," Draft at Tuscarora Mill. 	It pours a slightly hazy deep gold color.  The nose is full of yeast, hay, malt, and honey.  The flavor has notes of hay, honeysuckle, yeast, melon, and a nice bitterness on the back end.  The body is medium with lower carbonation and light finish with some lingering bitterness.  Certainly a high quality brew that everyone should try.
"
1," JAN 14, 2007 Jan. 12, 2007; 11.2 oz. bottle purchased for $3.95 at Marcy (NY) Discount Beverage.  Murky pour with ample, rapidly dissipating head; complex flavor of raisins, dark fruit & red wine with some tingly carbonation.  Alcohol is quite evident in both aroma and taste.  Very good overall, if a bit pricy.  May get some to store/age for awhile, as seems desirable to release this brews full potential.
"
1," Well. A high rated beer, but not for me. It has a bit to high alcohol for me, and it has a aroma and flavor with all for a strong belgian ale, but it also has a bad aroma and flavor of ""old, wet laundry"", that I don't like.
"
1," Best if sipped on a cold winter night in the Champagne region of France. Even more special if the product was given to you by a Trappist monk with his blessing and the product was 19 years old and stll tasted great. Like a fine cognac!!!!
"
1," 2003 33 cl. bottle. pours dark brown almost black with a sustained creamy tan head.	aromas of malt, cookie,  rasons, plum and slight hop.  flavors of sweet malt, chocolate, rason , plum, juniper, pepper with a dry hop finish.  the 75 cl bottle seems better developed and drier.  I think the flavor is a little more dull than previous examples I have had.
"
1," Smells of dark fruits and alcohol.  Slight plum aroma, and some flowers.  Deep brown opaque, perfect, frothy tan head.  Beautiful.  Taste of sweet malt, some roast, and fruit.  Lots of sweetness in the finish.  Really nice, hides the alcohol well, only a slight warming in the finish.  Full mouthfeel that gets slightly bubbly.  Very nice.  Great overall, I love the sweetness, would definitely drink it again.
"
1," ON tap at Rock Bottom ATL; sort of lucked into my first rating from Tennessee, although its not my first beer from the state.  Color ws dark brown, with not much head.  Aroma was very light with some choolate, nuts, must and chalk.  Flavor was actually pretty good and pronounced for the style; especially the roasted elements.  Also some nice nuts and chocolate present.
"
1," Dark color, malty, yeasty and strong dark fruity flavors of raisins and prunes.  Almost port like.
"
1," Has a lot of carbonation, then when that fades, it is a much more delicious beer.  The malty flavor is almost slightly sweet.  It doesnt really last on the palate, but it delicious while it is there.
"
1,"	This competent sweet stout is strongly influenced by its vanilla-laced bourbon, yet it never exaggerates as its barrel-aging and malty molasses sharply dip into drying roastiness. 		Further Personal Perceptions"
1," MAY 30, 2003 This beer had a nice head, dry and flavorful taste.  Nice aftertaste with a mild bite.  Malty and dark.  There was an armoa and taste of chocolate, clove, and wood.  It's a very natural tasting brew.
"
1," rasberry, banana, cinnamon.  Flavor"
1," JAN 22, 2005 Bottle - Sweet malt and acetone aroma.  Dark brown and cloudy with light tan head.  A very complex flavor - dark, dark chocolate/coffee malt - slightly sweet with a mild acetone/alcohol finish.  This beer had a much more chalky/atringent flavor when I first bought it but after aging this beer  for 6 months it mellowed out considerably.
"
1,"	There is a strong smell of dried fruits from this beer, dark summery fruit and berries in particular along with a touch of alcohol and grain owing to the strong alcohol content. There is also a strong malt aroma and a faint touch of caramel on the nose along with some good spicy notes right at the end.		Dark, orangey brown colour when poured and forms a thick looking, three-finger sized head that is off-white and foamy. The head roughly halves in size over the course of about a minute then holds at around a finger width tall for the remainder of the drinks life.		Sweet tasting with a lot of dried fruit to begin with in the taste and perhaps a bit of apple too. There is a lot of brown sugar like flavouring and a little bit of the roasted malts from the nose as well along with touches of alcohol. Its is a pretty solid effort from this beer.		Huge carbonation in this beer, a lot more than I had been expecting but that is not to say it was overly carbonated because it seemed to work for this particular beer. It was pretty smooth, with a medium body and great drink-ability; overall an nice beer on the palate.		A very good beer overall and one that I really enjoyed, it has most things going for it and not a lot holding it back. It may not be as good as Chimay Bleue but it was still a very good beer indeed.		1001 Beers Blog"
1," A copper pour with an off-white head.  The aroma contains pine and grassy hops.  The medium body has an oily texture with lively carbonation.  The taste move from bittersweet to bitter, yet flavor and transition is very smooth.
"
1," Beer 31 Belgium trip.  An old favorite, and my introduction to Belgian beers all those years back.  Medium brown, bit hazy, light notes of port and raisin.  Flavors matched, with a bit of piquancy, light malts.  Good, and will always hold a soft spot for this one.
"
1," had at Disney location in Florida.. this one has something .. . leach cat! .. . light malty maple and decent bitterness .. . light pine .. . very nice finish .. . enjoyable and way 2 easy to drink ..
"
1," Bottle  - aroma is quite vinous with even a touch of grape.  Deep garnet to almost purple with tons of floaties and yeast.  Flavor is quite sweet with malt and dark fruits.  Very nice!
"
1," JAN 17, 2011 Pours a copper red/ orange, with a off white head. Smells of what I can only describe as banana. Taste of fruit and nut and a hint of yeast. Overall very palatable and I look forward to have again.
"
1," has to be one of the best beers ever and worth the extra bucks over the cost of chimay red. its hard not to drink the whole 25oz. bottle, but probably better to share it with a friend.
"
1," bottle courtesy of infestaxion.  brown pour with an airy off white head. the barrel comes through pretty nicely on this beer in the nose and flavor. lots of coffee bock notes as well, and a drying palate to go along. pretty nice stuff.
"
1," Smooth and very nice mouthful. Dave bought for beach trip. Poured with thick white- tan head. Complex tasting.
"
1," Bought this as part of a Chimay holiday 3-pack that came with a Chimay glass.  Poured a deep caramel color with a dark, creamy head.  It gave off a nice scent of fruit that was predominantly apricot.  Drinking out of the accompanying glass left ribbons of yeast settling at the bottom, giving the beer a sweet finish.
"
1," Very dark cloudy brown with a big rock head, but the heads retention leaves something to be desired, and why is there no lacing? Is this an old bottle? Very disappointing looking pour, Ive seen this beer pour better. The smell is a woody alcohol with tingly spice, and just a hint of yeast, the aroma is a touch weak but still good. The taste is smooth and yeasty, Im noticing some cheery in the finish. Aged wood and maybe some nuttiness, very complex and hard to break down beer. The beer seems to be a touch thin (did I cellar this bottle to long?) and tons of carbonation to tickle the throat. This beer is very good and very complex and I think just had a bad bottle because I swear its better then I scored it
"
1," Dark cloudy brown with a lively head. Very fragrant. Aromas of dark fruit, caramel and spices. Flavor is mostly sweet, and the fruit flavors really come through in the finish. Very fizzy. Not my favorite trappist, but still very good, and very drinkable.
"
1," 0.5l bottle yesterday at the Sokol restaurant. Poured a pretty, murky orange-golden honeyish body with a medium sized white head. The nose is definitely nice, grainy, very finely hoppy and honeyish. Oooh, I think Ive hit a good batch. Damn tasty. Very fine chewy hops (Goldings?), a bit dusty, grainy and ends up a little in the rice cracker territory. Very light notes of carrots that usually ruin everything for me but this time they dont. Fine body. Refreshing and definitely a treat while sitting on the patio in one of the prettiest parts of Ljubljana with friends, resting after a train ride.
"
1," My favorite beer from this great brewpub. Nice and hoppy with an inviting aroma and appearance. I took a growler of this home.
"
1," (bottle) Hazy amber colour with a stable foamy and bubbling off-white medium head. Dusty malty and yeasty aroma. Slightly sweet malty and lemon fruity taste, fruity and light bitter finish with a touch of herbal hops.
"
1," Its a red/brown colored beer. It has a foamy beige head, which stays for a while. It has the aroma of sweet malt and some yeastiness. There are also some touches of fruit. The taste is from mild spices, a little bitterness. The alcohol isnt emphatic there. Still it has 9% vol. alc.. In the back some dark fruits, like raisins and a little chocolate. A very good complex beer.
"
1," Better than expected.  Pours a deep yellow color with limited head retention.  Sweet malty aroma.  I detected a fair amount of honey flavor in this beer.
"
1," Brown in color, has a medium body with a sweet, malty flavor. ok ale when sampling
"
1," Dark brown, light, big bubble head that sticks well. Medium-dark reddish brown. Tons of spice in the aroma, along with a good dose of Trappist funk. Effervescence is high, but doesnt bite too hard--actually quite soft. Good dryness to it. A bit of metal and fruit rind in the flavor.
"
1," Full-bodied and slightly sweet with a hint of berries and also has one of the best aftertastes of any beer to be found!
"
1," Pours hazy brown amber with a beige head. Aroma is sweet malt, nutty, and a little toast. Flavor is much the same with the addition of some roasty chocolate notes and a dose of hoppy bitterness.
"
1,"  bread dough, dark fruit with a bit of yeast.  Flavor is sweet and fairly complex with undercurrents of raisins, dates, cloves and toffee malts.  Still, mouthfeel is characteristically thin, like the others from Chimay.  Alcohol is detectable and creates a little bit of a warmth as it is sipped.  Nice stuff, but maybe not as good as I expected.
"
1," 12 ounce. Malty English IPA style. Lots of caramel and some sweetness. Very tasty for the style.
"
1," [50cl bottle.] Cloudy reddish brown with a loose white head; sweet yeasty aroma; rich malty flavour with lots of caramel and hints of vanilla and biscuit; creamy finish. Really good.
"
1," 500ml bottle shared with Finn at the brewpub, Ingolstadt. Big foamy head with some retention. Unclear orange body. Light hints of clove and wheat in aroma. Sweet orange taste. Wheaty dryness in the ending. On the very sweety side (22.06.2007).
"
1," Reddy brown with an aroma of cardboard and sugar.  Dryish brew, thin bodied, hints of cardboard, artificial hop and a dull sweetness.  Strange dry chemically malt finish with cardboard and alcohol.  This used to be a decent beer, what happened?  (Wine World, St Albans)
"
1," Suprising
"
1," Golden, small white head; moderate to solid sweet grainy to malty nose with a good dash of aromatic hops and a tinge of honey; clean moderate sweet flavour with a delicate bitterness, nearly medium bodied and really soft; slightly lingering sweet grainy, delicate fruity finish with a pretty aromatic hoppy aftertaste. Very nice Export.......
"
1," Bottle thanks to father-in-law.  Hazy brown with copious off-white head.  Mild spice, yeast, light fruity esters.   Refined toasted malt, light cherry, faint Belgian candy, and yeast.  Smooth to the max with mild alcohol.  Lightly dry and toasty.  Perfectly drinkable.
"
1," APR 28, 2010 what an amazing brew pour was brown and clody aromas of yeast alcohol and malts taste was of alcohol,raisen bread and choclates and alot more very complex as iI lokked in to tmy glass it was blowing smoke rinngs that continely rose from the bottom smooth and sweet can not wait for the next one
"
1," Draft at brewpub. Poured dark amber with an average frothy white head that fully diminished with fair lacing. Moderate grassy earthy hop aroma. Moderate balanced bitter flavor with a medium bitter earthy finish. Good drinkable brew.
"
1," Hazy pale yellow with a medium off white head. Yeasty aroma with wheat and bananas. Sweet flavor with wheat, yeast and banana notes.
"
1, </b>Fruit caramel and fruity leafy hops abound in this tasty APA calling itself an Amber ale.	<b>How
1," Golden, hazy, sourish (gherkins??) nose with grainy-wheaty undertones; sourish-tart flavour, light bodied for a beer of 5.2%; lemony-fruity traces in the tart and sourish finish. Sigh......
"
1," Hazy pale amber brew with an aroma of bubblegum and peardrops, almost like a wheat beer!  The flavour is fairly malty and continues with the strange wheaty flavour.  The finish is sweetish and short with some saaz-y perfumed hops.  (sampled on draught in the brewpub)
"
1," (300ml bottle, courtesy of Mora2000)  Pours a transparent body.  Aroma of vanilla, melon, and rice milk.  Flavor of vanilla, almond, and light florals.
"
1," GABF 2008, Dr. Bills tasting, 1998 vintage.  Pours clear tawny with spare, fizzy, off-white head, mostly diminishing with fair lacing.  Aroma is heavy malt (cookie, caramel, toffee), average hops (perfume), average yeast (leather) with notes of alcohol, dates, ginger, and tobacco.  Medium bodied, slick texture, soft carbonation, and a bitter finish.  Long duration, moderate sweetness, acidity, and bitterness.
"
1," big bottle, cork shot out at me and almost took my eye out. great very dark brown chocolate look with brown head. wide array of difference smells in the aroma, not too strong but quite pleasant... very malty and yeasty with a very strong aftertaste of roast. great beer for my 100th rating
"
1," Thanks to boney for this.  Great looking dark orange gold with a frothy white top.  Aroma is citrus hops and a great sweet honey malt.  Taste is a slow build of citrus hop bitterness and a great malt backbone that is just phenomenal.  Great beer, wish it was around me.
"
1," TheDM and Hotstuff vacation brew 8.  This draft brew was enjoyed at the Big River Brewery in Chattanooga Tennessee which was hosted by a pleasant accomodating staff.  The manager paid for our samples and even bought us appetizers to help clear our palates.  This brew poured a medium sized head ofwhite colored finely sized long lasting bubbles that left behind a uncarbonated transparent light red orange colored and a good lace.  It had a hoppy aroma and amouthfeel that was initially tingly from the hops and continued through to the finish.  It had a hop flavor to boot.
"
1," DEC 3, 2006 33cl bottle - pours a very dark brown almost, with a thick off-white head on top. Fizzy too, the beer is almost loud! Aroma is a lot of dark fruit, and some notes of banana. Taste is very smooth, and the mouthfeel is rich and full. Some roasted malt comes through in the flavour, and the alcohol is very well hidden. Some vinous character to the aftertaste. Quite flowery also. Reminds me of a more subdued Trois Pistoles (which I still prefer). My favourite of the three Chimay brews.
"
1," pours a beautiful reddish brown.  smell is great, sweet and raisiny.  taste is subtle but damn its good.  slighly sweet, easy finish.  yummy.
"
1," This bottle brew poured a large sized head of fine to large sized mostly lasting light brown colored bubbles that left behind a good lacing.  The body was a opaque dark black-brown color with no hope of seeing any carbonation.  The aroma was aromatic with a dominant bourbon scent that was very vinous.  In fact, I cant remember  calling an aroma vinous in the last 1300 or so beers.  The mouth feel is mildly tingly initially then finished with a vinous bourbon flavor nothing like any porter I have ever tastes.  You can taste the wood in it.  The flavor contains notes of bourbon wood dark malts and a mild hint of chocolate.  Very burnt and roasty.
"
1," The little bugger is an exploder upon opening, be warned. Bottle into a *Westmalle* (gasp) trappist glass. Dark bronzey and reddy-brown, very gorgeous red color when placed in the sunlight. Some floaty stuff, and the head is thick and foamy with a very light brown coloration. Quite active carbonation. Looks very ""happy"" if you will, and its quite beautiful. 		Aroma"
1," Pours a clear, dark brown with a thin tan head. Aroma is roasted malt, nuts, chocolate, and caramel. Malty, roasty flavor with chocolate, caramel, nuts, dark fruits, and molasses. Medium body with medium carbonation and alcohol masked nicely. Not bad.
"
1," Dark brown and murky in color. Aroma of fruit, malt and yeast. Flavor was more of the same -- raisins, figs, malts and caramel. Slight warming alcohol at the finish. Gets so much better as it warms.
"
1," MAR 1, 2010 Re-Rated because I love this fantastic brew even more.  Rich and slightly yeasty.  Reminiscent of baked apples and caramel.  But not too sweet.  Incredibly smooth finish.  Fresh and delicious; an excellent ale.
"
1," Bottle. Pours brown with a beige head. Sweet fruit aroma with some yeast. It could be a bit more aromatic but its nice nonetheless. Medium body. Flavor has notes of peach, apricot, other fruits, spice, and yeast. Very good.
"
1," (Draught) Sampled at the Great Canadian Beer Festival in Victoria, BC, September 8th 2008. Thin, white lasting frothy head atop an amber body. Honey and caramel nose. Flavour is thin with a small tart and malt appearance. Very similar to their lager. Average. 6/3/6/3/12
"
1," bottle, Byblos, New Orleans. First beer from Armenia, I believe. Pale color, Light aroma & flavor. Typical euro lager
"
1," Tall(24oz)- purchased onsite. Was not on tap yet, but the bartender pulled me one from the cooler( Very Nice Gesture) They call it a Brozne- a hybrid brew based on the dark almost reddish brown(bronze) appearance-Excellent aroma- nicely hopped-immediate bite on the palate then a smooth rush of maltiness with a touch of sweetness- one thing I will say about this brewey is their ability to balance the beers with hop/malt tones without over powering- the beer is very pleasant and different - Unique would be the term. Once again I left happy with that all natural buzz from a great brew. Also had a pizza- and it was phenominal!!!! Dough for the pies is made onsite also- a 24oz superior beer and a great pie for less than a movie- this place floundering- I beg to differ!!!!	The impertinence this brewery is getting is a disgrace- and those that are spreading it should be throttled about the head and neck reagion! Well done Alt Platz!!! Keep up the good beers!!!!!
"
1," Sampled at the GOBF.  Very sugar sweet and Belgiany.  Nice tart raisin smells as well as carmel malt.  Nice dark fruitiness.  I can definitely see why this is rated so high.
"
1," Red brown color with a lovely off-white, bubbly head.  Strong aromas of yeast, alcohol, fermented corn silage, and sour milk.  Ripe bananas can be found in the taste along with yeast and plastic -- all malts.  The body is about medium and leaves a thin film in your mouth.  I think this is the least favorite of the three Chimay colors.
"
1," Copper color with a off-white bumpy head. Flavor is sweet fruit and nuts with a touch of hops. A nice smooth, dry and slightly bitter finish, very fine carbonation. Very good dubbel - a fine compliment to the Indian food that I ate with it.
"
1," Sampled often.  Dark burnt caramel pour with a towering eggshell head that leaves significant lacing inside of the glass.  Definitely on a Belgian kick.  Fruity nose with some yeasty/peppery qualities.  Brown sugar, plum, raisin, toffee, and spicy with the ABV masked beautifully.  Medium mouthfeel.  Yum.
"
1," Bottle looks really simple but really good. Beer in the glass light brown, small head. Spicy-roasty aroma. Starts mild, almost a bit washy. Gets more and more moldy-malty. Finish a bit more warming, but still milder than exspected. I exspected more and I am a bit disappointed.
"
1," Thick creamy white head that lasts a good while. Dark reddish brown in color. Aroma of spice. Soft flavor of spice with malty tones.
"
1," Very tasty.  Full of a number of flavors.  Its hard to distinguish at times what youre tasting but all of it is good.  Less agressive than I expected.
"
1," Enjoyed at the brewery, draft.  This is a good looking beer.  Nice and clear with copper color and a thick head.  The aroma is a bit biscuit like with yeasty notes and just a hint of pine.  The flavor is nothing Id care to have again.  Biscuit and grain flavors with spicy nutty bitter hops.  Again, as in the aroma, a hint of pine.  Unfortunately the flavors do not blend well IMO.  Medium dry body.
"
1," Bottle at Papss - Thanks. Clear golden - white head. Light grassy, light bitterness, metallic, medium malty, notes of corn, reminds me of ""Guldl"". Plain.

1,"//www.ratebeer.com/View-User-14352.htm&amp;g You da man!</font>
"
1," Very light orange, off-white head. Floral and piney nose, sweaty average floral hops hide most of the maltiness. Barky, lasting oily hops bitterness, woody and annoying. Light bodied feels mysteriously sticky. Average..
"
1," Tap at brewery - Aroma of roasted malt, chocolate, and a touch of coffee.  Pours black with nice brown lasting head and great lacing.  Flavor touches aroma character but doesnt follow up.  Palate is smooth and creamy but too thin.  Tasty and easy drinking, but the body is  too light for a porter.
"
1," Head is initially small, frothy, white, mostly diminishing. Body is clear light yellow. Aroma is lightly malty (toasted bread/grain), lightly hoppy (herbs), with a hint of DMS. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Decent commercial lager.
"
1," Large beige head covers the hazy copper. Sugary and warming aroma despite the not too exuberant 6.5% ABV. The fruity, alcoholic and sweet flavour profile clearly belongs to a scotch ale though. Thick-bodied, soft and creamy, remarkably velvety texture. Candy reminiscent nose, not unlike Qubecs Sucre dOrge. A texture beer really. A warming, soft and foamy presence in the mouth, concealing a earthy, slightly peaty malt base. Gentle cherry juiciness on top of red licorice complexifies the ensemble. Pleasant drinking - I love the mouthfeel.
"
1," Quite sweet, I couldn't taste the alcohol in this. Bitter towards the end. A slight disappointment but enjoyable none the less.
"
1," JAN 22, 2005 Large bottle. A nice cloudy dark brown ale, I enjoy the mouthfeel of this very much. The flavor changes considerably from the top of the bottle to the bottom. Flavor is largely in the malt realm, not nearly complex enough to be one of the best. A highly drinkable brew, but still leaves a lot to be desired.
"
1," Very sweet and a great belgian ale.
"
1," Had a bunch of these on draft attending a Chattanooga Lookouts game, then tried it a month later at the Brewery.  There is some herb or something in it that just didnt appeal to me. I know it has won some awards so my review is just that  my opinion.  I dont find a very clean finish  sometimes grassy or herbal that leaves a funky taste with me.
"
1," Golden straw with minute particles. Small but tightly packed white foam. Slow but steady carbonation. Fresh lager aroma, traces of sulfur, toasted bread crust and herbal hops in the backdrop. Clean and quenching. Tasty baked white bread maltiness and an herbal/spicy hop balance. Medium thin body. Wafer of malt sweetness. Does not taste fake in any way. Solid malt body through and through. Finishes with a kiss of metal, but otherwise this is surprisingly attractive.
"
1," Great - but there is too much of an alcohol bite/aroma for a 7% ABV beer....		Also - its not your typical Belgian - its lighter and less complex than some of my favorite Belgian beers. However, for some this may be a good thing... especially if youre planning to drink a lot at one sitting...
"
1,"Big rich caramel malt flavor on front is slowly overtaken by some surprisingly stout resin and citrus. Some toasted nut flavor shines through a bit also. Soft, medium body is smooth and dryish on the finish. This is the only bottled G-B brew Ive ever had, and is by far the best Ive had of their stuff; usually not too impressed by their brews.
"
1," Bottle, pours a red beer with a huge foamy white head.  aroma is sweet fruit, not rotten fruit though.  Flavor is sweet and carbonated.  Not as yeasty as I was expecting it to be.  The body is very smooth and complex, yet balanced.  I have not completly figured this one out, I will probobly drink this one again.
"
1," Bottle (Beers of Summer at OTH). Pours cloudy amber with a white head. Aroma is nice hops, citrus, and honey. Flavor is bitter hops and citrus fruits. Light/medium mouthfeel. Decent.
"
1," Dark bitter with a caramel aroma and lightly bitter caramel flavour.  Overall a good quality bitter.
"
1," 33cl bottle, pours a hazy golden with a sizable white head, moderate lacing.  Aroma is candied fruits, yeast, some citrus hops and spice.  Flavor is more candied fruits sweetness, with some spice and a light citrus.  Not bad, and a notch better than the Westmalle Tripel, but realizing this style isnt doing much for me.
"
1," 750 ml bottle. Pours amber with a thick, long lasting off-white head. Aroma is of dark fruit, yeast and brown sugar.  Taste of dark fruit and brown sugar. Nice clean finish.
"
1," From notes. Pours the standard orange with a frothy white head. Aroma was nice, notes of spice and citrus, with a touch of pine and grass. Grass come through stronger in the flavor, as does the lemon and citrus peel. Very light mouthfeel. Pretty crisp and refreshing. Another good session beer from BI.
"
1," JUL 12, 2006 pours dark brown.  big tan head.  Fruity and spicy aroma  Flavor is somewha fruity, with clove hints.  Mdeium bitterness.  Finish is long, but very nice, an excellent brew.
"
1," Color, aroma, taste, were excellent. An incredible beer I would highly recommend.
"
1," Bottle. Pours cloudy brown with a fizzy beige head. Aroma is like peeled apple skin, with hints of caramel and spice. Medium body. Flavor has a general fruit sweetness, as well as a light spicy note. Nice.
"
1," A stinker. Hoppiness would be appropriate with some malt present, but unfortunately, this is maybe the lightest porter on the planet, so the hoppiness seems overdone. I have homebrewed for 17 years and have been disappointed with porters better than this. Three cheers for Diet Porter (or not)!!!
"
1,"	This is one of those beers that I am happy that we can get them in any supermarket here, and not that expensive either.	I enjoyed this brew years and years ago and still do to this day.	Had different ones with different years and different ages and you can taste the difference. But one thing you cant taste is the lack of body.	Sometimes the maltyness is more present, other time the darker spices and darker fruits have a more dominant character.	Whatever the case is, its a highly enjoyable beer.
"
1," FEB 19, 2003 Springfield, PA. Sharp and cloyingly sweet.  The alcohol presence becomes more and more noticeable.
"
1," 11.2 oz bottle- dark brown, non transparent when poured, head that disappeared, caramel/alcohol/fruit aroma.  Good feel, easy on the month with caramel overtone.  Finish a bit lacking, quickly disappears.  One that both sides of the beer fence (common swillers and beer-pagners) will enjoy.
"
1," Dark brown pour with a thick, foamy tan head that shrank down and left a fluffy blanket across the body for the duration.  Cloves are the centerpiece surrounded by sweet malt, bananas and other alcohol macerated fruits.  Flavor is sweet, spicy (mainly the cloves), malty, bananas, and apples.  A tremendous depth of flavor that is not too complicated.  The body has good consistency and flavors are blended well and very palatable.  Finish is somewhat sweet and sour.  Better than I remember the first time.
"
1," Bottle 500ml. @ home.Light light unclear medium to dark orange amber color with a average, frothy and open, good lacing, mostly lasting, off-white head. Aroma is moderate malty, caramel, nutty, dusty malt, moderate hoppy, orange - citrus, dusty hops. Flavor is moderate to heavy sweet and bitter with a long duration, spied hops, dark orange hops, caramel, peppery finish. Body is medium, texture is oily, carbonation is soft to flat. [20110207]
"
1," Sampled from 12-oz, white waxed top bottle and shared by Bobby91w and Bulldogp04 during Surly D-Day. Pours a semi-clear reddish copper amber brew with a decent off-white head that has some nice retention and excellent lacing. Aroma of light banana esters, cloves, candi sugar, a touch of dark pitted fruits, and some mild herbs. Taste is medium to full bodied, lightly carbonated, with flavors of multi-grain malt, banana esters, just a touch of cloves, candi sugar, a touch of plums, and a hint of dark berries. Finish has a slight metallic texture from its high alcohol presence with a semi-dry banana/yeast aftertaste that is quite refreshing. Uf Da! Lots of alcohol in this strong Belgian ale. Nicely done!
"
1," Bottle at London Drinker BF 07.  Gold with white head.  Ugly lager aroma. Naty pils that I sampled at room temperature.
"
1," Chimay Rouge is a very nice Belgian.  I not experienced enough in Belgians to detect major differences between this and the other ""colors"" of Chimay, however it is a nice beer with the same fresh yeasty and fruity aroma I have come to love in Chimay beers.
"
1," A deep, dark amber color with a bit more weight on the brown hues. The head is initially fluffy and khaki colored and then settles down to a thin layer.		S"

"
1," Bottled. This dark brown beer is lightly fizzy on the tongue and has flavours of chocolate, port, dried fruits, and dried sugar. There is also a floral quality and an enjoyable bitter finish with a hint of warming alcohol. World class and deserving of both its reputation and popularity.

1," Looking through my old notes and found this rating and was suprised I had not entered it already.  The smell is fruits, yeast, some spices, candi sugar, and dried fruits.  The look is a muddy reddish color with a good beiged colored foamy head.  The taste is a alcohol, spices, yeast, and fruits.  Very good beer.
"
1," Bottle. Deep dark brown color. Malty, slight flowery creamy aroma. Malty sweet flavor, medium bodied, with chocolate and hints of roasted malt and raisin. Excellent balance, and quite pleasant to drink. Always good to see a Dutch classic back on the market, even though it is brewed in Bavaria.
"
1," DEC 14, 2006 A creamy white head sits atop an amber pour tinted with copper highlights.  Yeast, fruit and alcohol in the aroma.  The flavor is yeasty and fruity.  Cherry, raisin and pear came through.  A little on the fizzy side until it truly opens up.  Nice creamy mouthfeel with a pleasant warm alcohol finish.
"
1," 12oz bottle pour. color is redish orange. 1 finger white head. aroma is of mild hops and malt, an even mix of the two. taste is malty with some lingering astringent citrus hop flavor.
"
1," sample @ the pub, nice orange color full of citrusy aroma, some caramel, the best surprise of their menu.
"
1," Bottle 500ml.Light unclear medium orange yellow colour with a average to large, frothy - creamy, good lacing, mostly to fully lasting, off-white to white head. Aroma is light malty, moderate yeasty, sweet yeast, light banana. Flavour is moderate sweet with a average duration. Body is medium, texture is oily, carbonation is soft. [20111002]
"
1," Bottle. Slight flowery aroma. Malty, creamy flowery flavor with hints of vanilla. Surprisingly full bodied. Quite likeable, typical Bavarian lager.
"
1," Deep nut brown, mahogany color with fully lacing tan head. Complex fruity aroma with dominating plums, and alcoholic dried fruits. Mild sweet raisins, plums with slight sugar candy and gingerbread edge. Medium spicy finish with some herbals and coriander. Very smooth and delicate with well hidden alcohol, but far away from Rochefort.
"
1," This pours cloudy amber with a tall, sticky off-white head.	Pine and citrus are melded with a juicy malt base in the aroma.	The flavor is bitter with plenty of hops, yet the sweetness is there in the back all along.	A welcome new comer to my area.
"
1," 75cl bottle., deep ruby-garnet color, almost opaque. malty fruity flavor. detect figs and prunes in the flavor. reminds me quite a bit of Orval. high alcohol, but youd never know it by the flavor.
"
1," Thanks to Bob, Michelle, and mostly my baby Jana for the 12th annual Indiana Microbrewers Festival today!  On tap @ the fest.  Nose of oats & cereal, coffee and nectar.  The brew is dark walnut with ruby highlights.  The slow cascade meanders into a tan creamy head that is mostly lasting with good lace.  The beer has a fruity & alcoholic start with a roasted coffee finish.  The medium body is creamy and very soft.  The finish feels chalky.
"
1," At the crack of the cap, the pungent aroma of the beer hit me with an almost fruity, citrus-y essence. Also, I could tell it was going to be a bitter beer due to the ever-prevalent smell of hops. As I poured it into my glass, it produced a very dark, amber, golden color. It was a little translucent - bordering opaque. It formed a white/gold head that was retained for a good 5 minutes or so. After I let the beer settle, I took a taste and got a hint of fruit - a bitter one; almost reminiscent of the peel of a citrus fruit (orange). There was also a bit of spice from the roasted ingredients used in the beer. As the beer enters, you can taste the alcohol and hops right from the get-go. After the initial hit, the beer mellows out quite nicely and on the way down it smooths out. It almost seems like wine with the progression of textures and sensations. I also noticed the aroma of the wood that the beer was fermented in. Overall, this was a very filling beer. It would go nice with a small, but hearty, meal. If you have too much food, I can see it overfilling you. The bitter taste of the beer is strong, but pleasant and not overpowering to the overall flavor. I greatly enjoyed this beer.
"
1," This is the kind of beer that brings pure hate out of me.  Pours clear mahagony with a small splotchy tan head.  The aroma has roasted malt, dark berries, light roast and coffee.  Medium / light body, thin flavors and sharp stingy carbonation.  Starts out very sour and astringent with well hidden light roast and bits of sour berries.  The finish has an unwelcome citric flavor and lots of tin.  I would have done better to flush my money down the toilet - by having this I had to taste this repulsive liquid first and then flush it.  Thumbs violently down! 
"
1," DEC 20, 2011 Aroma"
1," muddy brown with moderate-high carbonation. off white-light tan slowly diminishing head. good lacing. brandy, red wine, some earthy, yeasty, malty, and fruity smells as well. good balance and a nice sort of earthy flavor. taste was not as good as the smell belied. I cant find much in here. Theres some sweet malt and alchohol presence, but not a very significant flavor. body is just a tad thin, but the carbonation is done well. Drinkability was easy. 9% keeps you from drinking too many though.  Now I know why a lot of people say Chimay is overrated. I must say I agree. It lacked the complexity and flavor that I was expecting. Not a bad beer by any means, but certainly not as good as advertised.
"
1," This is the one that started it for me...my gateway beer. Dark brownish/purply pour with a great head. I love the delightful floral aroma. It goes down smooth with a slight warming toward the end. Good flavor, but nothing too insane. Just a really good beer.
"
1," FEB 18, 2004 Smells like roasted nuts, prunes, bananas, some leather, and chocolate. Taste was complex and chewy. Sweet ripe fruit and alcohol are all over the tongue in the finish. This is my ""go to"" Belgian because it's so easy to find.
"
1," Dark and portered with cream-hued head. Bourbon strong in the flavor but not acrid. The combo of porter and bourbon creat a toasted coconut flavor which is quite tasty. Very much like BBA stout. In fact, this is easily BBA Stout-Lite. Not very complex and would be much better if the porter element was richer. The bourbon helps, the porter lacks.
"
1," 11.2 oz brown bottle purchased from Armanettis, Mundelein, IL.  Clear hazy amber hued ale having small off-white diminishing head with excellent lacing. Some floating yeast chunks.  Fruity aroma with hints of caramel and raisins (prune?).  Soft carbonation.  Medium-to-full palate that starts with sharpness, fruitiness, and slight sweet malt with hints of caramel, prune (raisin).  Finishes dry with light bitterness.  A good drinkable Belgium ale.
"
1," bottle, bought at Killerton Estate. Clear golden colour, sourish apple nose. Slightly tart, dry on the palate yet with some subtle sweetness. Well-balanced cider.
"
1," caramel, resin, grass, herbs, orange, brown, hazy, rocky head, sparkling, light sweetness, lightly bitter, oily feel, medium body, lively, bitter, long finish,
"
1," Bronze with golden highlights and a thick, silky head. As with their blonde, there is a distinct winy chardonnay aromatic quality, perhaps from the yeast. Noble hops dominate the flavor. Earthy, light floweriness.
"
1," A darn good Aventinus clone, but its made in my home town, so that makes it better.  This type of beer always seems heavy on my stomach, so as much as I want to drink a ton of this, I just cant.  Tom has a good recipe with this one and the atmosphere he provides make it a great great beer.
"
1," Small bottle; yeasty and one, okay mabey two dimensional but it doesen't live up to the hype the way Rochefort 10 does. Not bad, just not earth-shatering
"
1," this does go like vinegar if it is stored in the fridge it changes the taste completely, like vinegar with a aftertaste of berries; not nice cold.
"
1," Dark brown beer with medium head. Malty aroma with hints of plums and chocolate. Same goes for the sweet and complex flavor. Nice warming alkohol in the end. Develops in glas.
"
1," Pours gold/copper with a white head.  Smells of sweet malt amd yeasty.  Tastes of caramel and residual sugar with some grassy hints.  Messy beer.
"
1," Brown thick head, slowly disappearing. The body is dark copper colour and the aromy slightly fruity. The taste is fruity, but a bit more bitter than its cousin the Chimay bleue. No obvious alcohol in the taste, and a milder finish. Very good, but I still prefer the bleue.
"
1," Cask.  Amber coloured beer with a thin white head.  Very thin aroma, citrus and spicy hops.  Body is thin and watery with very little flavour.  Not worth the trouble.
"
1," A sweet beer with a dry and bitter flavor that will suprise you.  Those monks can make some good beer.
"
1," Shared by Taverner, pours cola brown with thin aff white head. The nose is the best thing about this guy. Rich with bourbon, but the flavot is thin and a bit bland. Clean finish.
"
1," 330ml bottle. Now that I am putting more thought into rating beer I found it did not live up to my expectations/memory. Nice enough, with a quickly dissipating medium head. and a turbid, amber-brown appearance. I found everything middle of the road - fruity with a hint of sweetness and yeast in both aroma and flavor. Medium body and a thin, mildly bitter finish
"
1," (swing top bottle, courtesy of Quack-Duck) Hazy, dark brown colour with a beige and thick foamy head. Sour and ashy wheat-malty nose with notes of dark and red berries, light hints of bubblegum and cloves. Sour and slightly sweet flavour, light to medium bodied with a moderate carbonation. Wheaty, dark malty and slightly ashy taste with berry-fruity notes and phenolic spices; quite dry and sour-fruity finish with present cloves. 13.I.09
"
1," FEB 28, 2003 (28Feb2003--750ml bottle)	A big letdown compared to the draft version.  Heavy acetaldehyde, bitter, tangy, yeasty.  Huge rocky head.  I give it a 3.2 or so.	(26Dec2002--draft) What a treat to find Chimay on tap in the U.S.	A memorable experience!  Deep red color.  Thin, bubbly, persistent,	and creamy head with good lace.  Incredibly floral hop aroma, balanced	with sweet malt.  Perfect mouthfeel.  Fruity, floral	flavors.  Watermelon, honey, and wildflowers.  Alcohol	very well-hidden.  I'm having trouble placing this	beer in the context of other Belgians, as my experience is	limited.  Aw, shucks, guess I have some tasting to do!
"
1," Bottle, 4.9%. Mild buttery aroma. Clear very pale yellow colour. Small stable white head. The flavour has some hay, hint of grain. A little sourness in the finish along with a hint of butter. Not fresh, but not past BB date.
"
1," Aroma is wheat/malts, spices and orange/lemon.  The flavor is wheat grain/malty along with a decent underlying fruit/spice flavor.  Relatively light in body but with a witbier its expected, this was pretty good.
"
1," I can see why this beer is loved, but its just not up my alley. Soft yeasty flavor gives way to sweet and malt tastes.
"
1," Beer perfection. Doesn't get any better than this. Spicy, Malty and phenols, everything a trappist ale should be.
"
1," Pours Dark brown/reddish, complex flavor, very spicy, somewhat fizzy, not much aroma.  Medium body, not bitter.
"
1," MAR 27, 2008 Copper color with a medium head.  Light aroma of malt and yeast.  Very weak spice notes in the taste.  Moderate alcohol presence.  The malt flavor is almost hidden.
"
1," Bottle, picked up in Chattanooga.  Poured clear, lighter reddish-orange with a short-lived cap of white head.  The aroma picked up lots of over-sweetened caramel malts with the slightest bit of toast to em.. fainter dark fruits emerge with warmth, along with some herbal and earthy notes.  The flavor again found too-sweet caramel and dark fruits with fizzy herbal and floral bitterness falling off the sides of the tongue.. sweet, tacky finish.  Lighter-bodied and too sweet on the palate, but refreshing.. this was certainly drinkable.
"
1," Pale golden and clear, with a medium sized white head that laces a bit. Aroma of grain and faint fruit. Taste is light and grainy without being as watery as most light beers. Light bodied with average carbonation. Good beer, considering...
"
1," aroma of dark fruits and yeast... rich smooth malt flavor.  not my absolute favorite of the trappist ales but excellent nonetheless
"
1," Bottle.  Brown, slight haze, medium beige head.  Malty, with slight yeast in aroma.  Flavor similar to aroma with spicey undertones.  Nice beer.
"
1," Intens deep brown beer with ivory coloured head. aroma is sweet strong and rich. It has a touch of dried fruits, caramel and fine hint of coffee. taste is smooth, powerful and complex, it has notes of caramel, malts with a slight roasted character and some fruits, it ends with a nice touch of very fine hops.
"
1," 11.2oz bottle.Aromas of fresh hop extract(some metallic notes pleasantly integrated,yeast(banana),malt,refined funk,pretty nice, all things considered. Appearance is very nice,hazy super amber,with a very nice head snd some  very fine lacing
"
1," Pours near black with ruby hues and a mostly receding tan foamy head. Taste is toffee, light chocolate, phenolic fruits, cherries, and spice. Mouthfeel is medium to full with lush carbonation. I dont know why this is considered a traditional ale, its pretty much a Belgian-style stout, except for the serious shortage of yeast character.
"
1," Pours a hazy orange, with a quickly diminishing white head.  Hops smell of the wacky weed.  Heavy mari-ju-ana.  I sniffed it for awhile, although it wasnt the smell I was quite looking for.  Tastes kind of like plants and weeds.  Very earthy to be politiclly correct.  I really dont get that grapefruit that I usually get with IPAs.  It needed maybe a different kind of hops.
"
1," Sampled at a shared tasting in Venice, Italy.		Light Ruby.		Unpleasantly aromatic with notes of bread, medicines, seawater, salt, green plants and dark fruits.		Dark fruits reside but the entire front and mid-palate is completely non-existant. The finish however is lovely, lingering and full of a malty sweetness. Once again though, my main problem, as with all the Chimay beers is the total lack of body. This beer still sucks but it blows away that awful Grande Reserve that they also produce.
"
1," Poured a cloudy brown with a light tan head. Aroma is raisins, yeast, and a hint of alcohol. Taste is fig, raisin, caramel, and dark bread. Good sweet and bitter balance. Lively mouthfeel. Alcohol is concealed almost entirely.

1," An Excellent refreshing brew.  A rich reamy head....deep copper colour.  A wonderful Belgian.
"
1," Draught at the Priory Arms, Stockwell, in autumn 2007. A murky mid brown colour with a malty aroma. Sickly malt taste with some hops. Palate is ok but this is a below average bitter.
"
1," Dark amber appearance with a frothy head when poured.  Taste is malty but has a light biscuity finish.  The alcohol is present but nicely hidden with the carbonation and the dark toasty malt base.  A great beer to have on a chilly autumn Saturday.  Best when served cold.  A highly recommended Belgian Strong to have in your refrigerator.
"
1," Dark brown with little head. Big mocha syrup, black malt aroma. Light/medium body and smooth. Big coffee bean, cocoa, and blackened malt flavor here with a nice espresso bitterness to finish. As advertised its a Java stout.
"
1," Lightly floral aroma, with wheat, maybe a tad of lemon. Pours an opaque caramel brown/tan, with a generous creamy white head. Head dissipated in about a minute. Flavor is heavy with malt and fruit, apples and pears. Finishes with malt, apples, and a hit of floral hops. Feels thick, not as creamy as Chimay Bleue, with active carbonation. Warming in the chest as opposed to the face. Very tasty.
"
1," Bottled. Burnt amber colour. Sweet, spicy roasted malt aromas.  Roasted malt, with nutty spice flavours. Smooth palate with strong but disguised alcohol. A very complete beer. This rating was from a small bottle but I did age one of the larger bottles (purchased on location in Brugge) for about 18 months. It was slightly musty and didnt appear to stand up to the aging well at all.
"
1," 750 in De Koninck goblet.  Chilled bottle opened loudly; pour is hazy brown with lofty cream head.  Aromas of cedar, cookie spice, and a hint of sulfur.  Flavors of snappy phenols, dates, and resin.  Effervescent; burps have more apple than phenol.  Body is seemingly more substantial than my last tasting, but it still has a little of the Coca-Cola nature. This is likely the very first Belgian ale I ever tasted 12 years ago.
"
1," JUL 9, 2008 Absolutely zero head on this baby.  Another much-maligned readily available belgian beer that has suffered due to its popularity.  Not being a prima donna, Im gonna say that this is a great beer.  An interesting literal and metaphorical tongue sizzle from beginning to end.  Appreciating a good beer is like making love to a beautiful woman...no two muffs are alike and sometimes im inclined to something a little rough around the edges (i am an AvidDirtman after all).		Im fascinated by the different colours in the glass.  The outer rim seems light brown fading into a hazelnut utopia. The nose is a mixed bag of nuts and it has a malty, milk chocolate palatte.  Yeah weve all drank westveleteren (and i have - tis an amazing brew) but this is still perfectly drinkable beer that would still be held in high regard if it werent for some other indescribable beauties out there.
"
1," Bottle at Toridon Hostel. Pours an almost clear dark yellow with a tiny head. Mellow sweet and dryness. Aromas of cereals and some caramel malts. Some fruity hops. Hints of honey. Medium bodied. Medium to soft carbonation. Dry finish with malty notes.
"
1," caramel, amber, hazy, frothy, tan foam, light sweetness, lightly sour, medium bitterness, light body, thin feel, fizzy,
"
1," For i began to rate, i got three bottles with three different expiring dates . 		The first, expiring date 2005 hazy brown coloured, with an burning mouthfeel. Taste of an very mellow smooth faint whiskey and there is an good vanilla smell and taste also.		The second, expiring date 2008 this have not that whiskey-like appearance, but is more nuttier of taste, and hints of caramel. But its slight weaker of character.		The third. expiring date 2014, the one thats counts for this rating. This have more body and have an more foamy head. More taste of spices, and hints of caramel.
"
1," Dark molasses pour in the glass. Nose and taste of strong raisins, dark fermented fruits, sweet wheats and plum. Rated 6/10/2000
"
1," On tap at BR-Nashville.  Amber red pour with a soft white head.  Aroma was malty.  Little hop presence. Taste was ok but could have used a little more hop presence.
"
1," (12oz bottle)  Pours a clear amber body with a medium beige head.  Aroma of peach, apricot, pineapple, and florals.  Flavor of pineapple, orange, peach, grass, and caramel malt with a moderately bitter finish.
"
1," Hazy light brown color with a pillowy head that hangs around for a bit. The flavor features big, full malt, a hint of hops to cut through the sweetness, and some apricot in the finish. Starts creamy and ends dry. Very interesting sensation. As it warms, I getting butterscotch and some pepper.		Overall, a sensational beer. Big flavors, great texture, complex, and balanced.
"
1," JUN 6, 2009 750ml bottle. Pours a nice burgundy colour with a large beige head, and lots of carbonation. Aromas are indistinct, but mostly yeasty, esterly. The flavour is nicely complex, very sweet, notes of caramalts for sure, some raisins, almost some bready malts in there which I did not expect at all! It gives way to a dull bite mid-palate, which to me seems like the only detectable presence of hops and alcohol. Very smooth on the palate, other than the finish, which is long. Some ripe, almost fresh tasting fruit flavours are evident in the finish and aftertaste, apricot, pear, as well as the added sugar and yeast. Not bad, my first Dubbel, I trying to get more into Belgians so this was a good experience for me.
"
1," Very refreshing nice and fruity, yet bitter at the same time, nice big head as well.
"
1," Chestnut-amber coloured with a firm and stable off-white head; caramelly and a bit toasted nose with a faint herbal touch; moderate sweet-bitterflavour, light to medium bodied; moderate dark-malty and slight toasty finish with a mild, but distinctive bitterness in the aftertaste. Nice Dunkel.................
"
1," Bottle, danke Martin! Golden, fine carbonation, low head. Bready, light spicy aroma. Swee malt base, white bread, light honey, subdued hop counterpoint. Light almond aftertaste. Chewy, slightly sticky body.
"
1," Fresh sample, brewed by my friends mom for a wedding. Sampled in a very traditional plastic mug ;-) Hazy orange, no head but residual bubbles. Huge aroma, yeasts, esters, fruit (not dark malty types) and a slight almost lambic-like funkiness. Taste is upfront sour, yeasty with a definite alcohol presence. Not sure if I can pick out the juniper.. Palate is rich, sticky with a loong finish. There is no carbonation. This is great stuff, really happy to have tried it.
"
1," 12 oz bottle. Pours stark black with small beige head. The aroma is vinous and thick with dark fruit and raisin at first pour, but after it breathes for a minute it gives way to a more ashy and roasty character, maybe even a hint of smoke, and some spice and licorice. The flavor is burnt toast and lots of barrel. Im surprised by the amount of ashy bitterness in this. It was a little offputting at first, but its growing on me. The finish is dry but has some raisin notes to it. Not too shabby.
"
1," Sampled at Viti, basically the same as the regular lager just with lime and some spice. Marginally better.
"
1," Smooth + spicy with dark toffee flavours coming through, alcohol comes through faintly on the nose, though you dont feel that expected kick that 9%AV should give you.
"
1," Pale cloudy yellow with a nice head, although it's not quite the stiff, long-lasting head you expect from a hefe. Clovey nose with slight banana esters. It has a nice wheaty body, nice but mild flavors. There's a faintly bitter finish from the high (for style) hopping.
"
1," Faint amber colour with a thin white head.  Little aroma, but what is there is good caramel malt and light cherry fruit.  Taste is also quite fruity, some citrus and a nice bitterness.  Spicy finish.  Very good.
"
1," Nice lasting head to the orange/copper color. Slight hops spring from the aroma. Not as hoppy as Stone, but the best of the 6 beers I sampled.
"
1," Dark brown decent head.  Somewhat dry... To me not in the same league as the Rochefort 6.
"
1," Bottled. A hazy golden beer with a thin beige head. The aroma is sweet with notes of malt and caramel. The flavor is sweet with notes of malt and straw, as well as lighter notes of caramel, leading to a dry and bitter finish. Thanks yespr for sharing.
"
1," Pours medium brown with a lot of sediment and a medium sized light brown head. Nose is moderately strong and very brown-sugary and malty with a touch of yeast and alcohol. Flavor is rich and well-hopped for a dubbel, albiet still overmatched by a big dark malt. Finish is dry. Not the best dubbel Ive ever had but very good stuff.
"
1," AUG 18, 2008 Bottled, 75cl champagne-cork. Orange-brown and hazy-looking with a small head. Cellar, caramel, spices and some hops in the aroma. The flavor is quite sweet, with roasted malt, caramel and candi-sugar. Full-bodied beer that disappointed me a bit, comparing to the blue and white Chimays, but definately a good beer. Rating"
1," Great as expected from Chimay.  Nice sweet and creamy flavor with a well defined head.  Chimay makes a good strong brew with a smooth finish!
"
1," Pours an opaque ruby-brown color with a big, bubbly white head.  Aroma is earthy and malty... citrus, caramel, hops, and flowers.  Flavor is sugary, bitter with hops, earthy, citrus, alcohol, and it has a bitter lemon aftertaste.		11.2 oz. bottle.
"
1," Average frothy slightly off-white head.  Murky amber/brown body.  Slight fruity aroma.  Taste is sweet and almost takes on a champagne flavor.  The finish is very slightly bitter/astringent/spicy.
"
1," Sampled from 12-oz bottle at Surly D-Day. Pours an opaque dark brown brew with a thin light tan head that slowly dissipates to a creamy top and excellent lacing. Aroma of toasted dark malt, some vanilla, smoked wood, a touch of chocolate and bourbon. Taste is medium bodied, lightly carbonated with flavors of toasted dark malt, chocolate, bourbon and some vanilla. Finish is where more bourbon character comes through with a metallic aftertaste and a lingering vanilla flavor.
"
1," bottle.	Dark brown/black pour with a brown head, the aroma is of vanilla. It starts out a bit creamy and finishes a bit bitter.
"
1," MAY 16, 2008 Nice dark red-brown colour. Head is quite thick and long lasting. Sweet fruits, raisins and little spices and alcohol in the aroma. Flavor is only little bit sweet and so it differs  from aroma. Medium body and lot of carbonation. Good beer and I strongly recommend this.
"
1," Deep red colour with a thick frothy off-white head.  Alcohol, Prunes and spicy aroma with a hint of citrus fruit  (The Alcohol is kinda masking the other flavours) .  Mouthfeel is quite creamy.  Fairly clean finish with a bit of alcohol.
"
1," Bottle. Opaque body with a thin film of bubbles. Nose-butter, bourbon, smoke, char. Taste-char, burnt coffee, acrid char (in a good way). The char overwhelms all of the other flavors.
"
1," Definitely not the best Belgium Ive had.	More of a smokey flavor than I imagined.  Doesnt Chimay	have a great reputation?
"
1," Bottled. Pours a hazy orange amber with large but diminishing white head. Nearly explosive carbonation. The taste is cloves, toffee. I need to re-rate this one when I more focused on the task at hand.
"
1," (On tap) Nashville. Clear, fully golden with a creamy, off-white head. Rather weak aroma of malt. Light-bodied with some caramel malt and a somewhat irritating bitter hopping which is utterly raw and unsophisticated. Vaguely moldy. 290306
"
1," I tried a bottle of this beer after not really liking the previous two Belgium beers I had (Nice Chouffe and Orval).  Neither were my type of beer.  I decided to try the Chimay, as it was recommended to me that if I didnt like the others I tried, I would probably like this one.  At first I did feel it tasted better than the other Belgium Ales I tried, but after awhile I realized that the aftertaste (which was a heavy amount of sweet/fruity overtones) was just not to my liking.  Since the Belgium Ales always seem to get high marks, I want to like them - but I guess my tastes go towards other types of beers (like a porter or a stout).  I am not saying this beer is bad, far from it.  It is just not the taste I am personally looking for.
"
1," Dark Brown with a diminishing beige head. Aromas of plum, raisin, and some clove. Spicy and sweet flavor. No alcohol flavor or smell, but slight warming on the way down. Clean finish. Great beer.
"
1," Pours a fine cloudy, coppery amber. Spices, cinnamon, fruit, a little pumpkin with some hops.. vaguely Christmas-y aromas & flavors though not nearly as overt as that style. Carbonated, alive in the mouth. Multi-dimensional palate. Quite pleasant.
"
1," rich and bold flavored, huge head, nice and spicy, the flavor is spectacular, lots of spices and flavor throughout.
"
1," Bottle at the Bloomington Beer Festival. Poured black with a dark brown head. Aroma was full of coffee and oat notes. Flavor had a combination of sweet chocolate and bitter coffee notes.
"
1," Tap in brewery.  A nice malty aroma - dark yellow cloudy color.  Flavor of citrus and malt - very nice straight from the tap.  Brewery is definitely worth a trip on your way to Neuschwanstein.
"
1," Golden coloured, quite stable white head, visible carbonation, moderate grainy-strawy nose, accompnied by a shy wave of aromatic hops; moderate sweet-bitter flavour, soft MF, medium bodied; grainy and sweet finish with a light bitterness in the aftertaste. Clean and smooth...........
"
0," Looks like Bartles & Jaymes.  Fizzy, yellowish-white, no head.  Smells a little bit like an alcoholic 7Up.  Horrid stuff.  Jalapeno juice, fake lime.  A flat, lousy gimmick beer not worthy of a craft brewery.
"
1," Sipping on this  one now.. for some reason it doesnt seem quite as tasty as the last time I had it so Ill try to balance my review between the two times Ive tried it...		The appearance is probably my favorite aspect of this beer - it pours a cloudy/murky brown color that is quite hypnotizing to look at.  The aroma is mainly a sweet/smokey/malty scent.  Flavors are largely reminiscent of some standard Belgian yeasts with a strong sweet & roasty finish.		Great beer and definitely something Id drink again.
"
1," One of the great beers	smooth but not a dnse as the Blue.	unmistakable yeasty Chimay taste
"
1," Bottled. Hazy brown color, medium off-white head. Aroma of caramel malt, slight roasted, german hops, which give it the typical wurzig/herbal character of a German beer. Too bad, this doesnt fit too good with a dutch style dark bock, which is usually a bit sweet. And so is this bock. So, its a bit of a mix between a german dunkel and a sweet dutch bockbeer.
"
1," Big chocolate aroma. Very dry, chocolate and coffee flavors. Some spice and vanilla. Good stuff, tastes like a unsweetened mocha.
"
1," 33cl bottle. Browny red beer with thin beige/grey head. Seem to remember this being a dark malt beer, but not so. Yeast and red berry  nose. Yeasty in mouth, not a temendous depth then more strawbery/raspberry/kiwi fruit fruit and zingy hop dry finish. Drinkable and nice red berry juice, but not a lot of depth
"
1," Bottle.  Brown slightly cloudy pour with a nice tan head.  Aroma of nuts, spices, apples and malt.  Caramel taste with spices present.  Great finish.  One of the best and very accessible.
"
1," 0,33l bottle from Belgium. Hazy light brown color with frothy beige head. Interesting cheese, barley, fruits and alcohol aroma. Its a bit smoky. Medium bitter-sweet taste. Medium body with creamy texture and average carbonation. Bitter-sweet fruity finish. Its a wonderful beer. Unique aroma and taste. Very good choise.
"
1," Draught.  Poured golden yellow, rather pale for a pale ale.  Light floral aroma.  Well balanced body, nice arrangement between the malt and hope.  Light hop finish, with a bit of spice
"
1," A sparkling clear copper body is topped by a frothy tan head. The aroma is yeasty and quite malty. The flavor has a certain spiciness about it that is quite nice, also sweet malt and yeast come into play.  Body is medium and the carbonation, while quite lively in the glass, is not overly so on the tongue. Pre-RateBeer this and the Ommegang brews were about the only Belgian-style beers I ever drank. I quite surprised at how well this beer stands up to the many other Belgians I have had since joining RateBeer. It is not in the Westvleteren class of Trappist brews but it is still quite a beer. The gift pack that includes all three standard Chimay beers as well as a Chimay chalice is a steal.
"
1," Pours a nice looking mirky brown colour with a foamy white head. The aroma is of malt, herbs and various fruits. The taste is also quite malty and a little bitter with a slight fruity sweetness. Nice finish and overall a good and complex beer.
"
1," Malty fruity nose with hints of dried apricot.  Pours a transluscent copper with an off white head.  The taste is subtle and sweet and has a bitterness to it that gives a little bubbly sensation in your mouth.  It is very soft and smooth and was quite nice.

1," A yellow beer with a disappearing white head. The aroma is sweet with primary notes of straw, but also light malt notes. The flavor is sweet malty with light notes of butter, leading to a dry hoppy bitter end.
"
1," the elegant packaging and stratospheric pricing.  it has a wire muzzle like a police dog,  it has a thick substansial bottle and a champagne style cork, its blessed by bacchus and the pope and michael jackson;  trying to set all this aside and evaluate it for myself, i see a deep orange brown nectar the color of an old leather suitcase (p. 1675); almost as brown as the bottle itself.  a beautiful exuberant display of bubbles upon unleashing; light beige, bubblebath head, diminishing. first pour is hazy, consomme rather than chunky soup, but plenty of flotsam remains in the bottle"
1," Had this both on cask and on tap. The difference is significant. Its dry hopped, its very good. Lots of lace. Hoppy aroma. Cask conditioned is very flavourful
"
1," 500ml bottle at Chris o New Year tasting 08/09.  Pale gold, slight haze, thin white head.  Not much aroma, apart from a syrupyness that lasts into the flavour.  Some lemon hop on finish.  Its not too good.
"
1," Dry roasted malt aroma with hints of smoke. Dry champagne like flavor; heavily carbonated. Initial mouthfeel is one-dimensional (dry roasted malt), but some complexity prevails by mid-bottle. And, the finish is the best as all of the yeast and sediment that was sitting at the bottom of the bottle reaches the glass at final pour, providing some of the sweetness missing from the initial taste. The 9% ABV is very well hidden. Make sure to pour the entire contents into the glass at once, or you will miss a substantial part of the beer's flavor. Chimay Bleu can serve as an after-dinner beer. Well made.
"
1," Deep gold, no head. Light malt nose.Full bodied for a lager.Sweet malt flavor fades to a dirty line finish. Flat
"
1," Pours with minimal head into its own chalice. Mild candi sugar and bread yeast in the nose. Mushy, slightly vegetal taste, odd sugars and belgian malts. Yeast is not too distinctive or attractive, for that matter. Fits the style and is moderately enjoyable, but a bit muddled and messy IMO.
"
1," Very sweety bock, i found now out its from Bavaria, with chocolates hints.
"
1," This is the kind of beer you drink hoping for Matt OHanlon to make a play. I was expecting something terrible, but instead it was a very middle of the road drinkable beer. Not much flavor, but not offensive either. I would never seek this out, but if someone hands one to you it is acceptable to drink.
"
1," This is by far the best beer ever created. A lot of interesting flavors contained within. Good alcohol content too! Ive got to culture a yeast from this stuff.
"
1," Opened this one on Super Bowl sunday, thinking try a great beer for a great day.  Well opening the bottle and pouring into my glass, and low and behold super head!!!!	Couldn't get the head not to establish itself.  Left me really dissapointed because the little fluid I did have was tasty.  The cork was labeled 09/01 so maybe that was the problem.  I will have to buy another bottle some time and re-rate.
"
1," A little bit too strong for me, but Ive grown to expect that from Belgian ales.  Nice smooth flavor that is very sweet with a light alcohol flavor.  All together this could be one of the best Belgians Ive had yet.
"
1," APR 28, 2011 My impression of this beer has changed a lot over the years  At one stage I completely fell out of love with it  but trying it again I can remember the romance of my first Trappist . Murky brown with a proud foamy sustaining head. Aroma of sweet caramel and toasted malt and plums. Sweet malty flavour with a gentle note of dried fruits and figs. The finish is mildly bitter and has a slight alcoholic warmth.	It does lack the dried fruit and spicy  complexity of some of the other dark Trappists. However it compensates for this with a gentleness and accessibility that is enjoyable .
"
1," (Bottle - 0,33 l,  2003 vintage - at Man in the Moon, Stockholm, on 2009-07-27) Deep dark brown and hazy. Small white head. Malts, raisin and chocolate in aroma. Full bodied and dry palate with little carbonation. Malts, nuts, raisin, chocolate, sweetness, bitterness and cocoa powder in taste. Malty aftertaste.
"
1," 12oz bottle.  Pours a cloudy orange/brown with a thin, fleeting head.  Aroma is a light mixture of nuttiness, hops, and roasted malt.  Taste is medium-bodied and well-carbonated with a strong nutty flavor and some subtler, sweeter hints of caramel and chocolate.  A pleasant if somewhat formulaic brown ale.

"
1," ( 22oz bottle vintage of 2007 thanks to bu11zeye) Pours clear dark brown with nice lace and oily bubbles in the head. Nose of bready yeast and not much else. Taste of unsweet chocolate, bread with a tingly/creamy finish. Perhaps slightly oxidized.

1," Pours medium to dark brown with wispy film for head. Lots of dark fruit and and some sweet malt in the aroma. Bunch of different flavors, dark fruit, caramel, faint sugar, alcohol and spice. Overall very chewy, yeasty character to it. I do remember this being better, but that was before my beer geek days. Could be access to more stuff nowadays.

1," On tap at the brewpub from a taster glass. Aroma is quite floral and spicy, I can pick up hints of alcohol, not really inviting. Taste is quite spicy from the hops and the booze but I moslty taste the alcohol. Palate is very lively and too harsh for my liking. Too boozy and rough sums it up.

"
1," JUN 9, 2007 OK first thing I have to say is look at the ratings for St. Ambroise Oatmeal Stout the 4th highest rated beer out of Canada, Ive had that and the Iron Horse beats it by far, way more flavor, great chocolate, with the ever so slight coffee coming out, smooth as hell, awesome black color with sweet creamy head that stuck around the whole time.
"
1," Aroma of dried fruits.  Taste of raisins and liquorice.  Alcohol well hidden.  Very good.
"
1," The appearance is thick, murky dark cherry red, with a tinge of mahogany. Steady, thin off-white head resembling the ozone layer. Opaque as the deep oceans.		Spicy yeasts are glittery in the nose. Some orange peel, some bar soap. As it warms, it becomes more flowery.		The taste is spicy with a pretty bready base. Belgian yeast with a flowery hop. A spicy, spiky initial flavor, but a sweet citrus/fruity finish, which follows into the aftertaste.		The feel is fizzy and chewy. A big thick consistency, leaving a nice aftertaste. A really great beer, greater than the sum of its parts.
"
1," Aroma of lemon with no malt to speak of. A light yellow pour with a tiny white head and lace. Not much past the lemon. Very thin and watery but when cold pretty damn refreshing at a ball game when its 90 degrees.
"
1," What a way to start an education in beer.  I spent two years in Belgium as an Army brat and thought this would be a nice reunion.  It was very smooth going down, slightly bitter, and had a nice aroma.  Compared to similar beers, it was very strong in flavor.
"
1," Definitely one sexy looking beer.  Intense all the way through, with a hint of the alcohol showing through.  Flavor comes back nicely when you burp, but this is one beer you dont mind repeating.
"
1," THis could use some time in the cellar. Pretty brown with a white head. Nose is lovingly chalky, malty and yeat like. Like a good sweet hawaiian bread in the glass. However exceedingly chalky. Like a bad belgian on tap. Far far far too carbonated. This would mellow out after a ferw years and be retarded but for now a new bottle is not all that great	G-rat
"
1," A great ale! Just about perfect.
"
1," Bottle from StFun - thanks as always, Josh!!! Yeah, this one was pretty nice. Dank and fairly still pour, russet color somehow very monastic. Sharp and slightly yeasty nose gives way to abundant sweet malts. Rich flavors, with lots of currant and fig, but nothing thats cloying, thankfully. Slightly aggressive right now, with some heat in the finish, but definitely enjoyable.
"
1," 	Bottle at GBBF. Light cloudy brown with a thing white head. Standard bananary weiss with a slight sourness. Il agree with Royce on the cardboard finish. Nothing special.
"
1," Had from bottle.  Pours dark brown with off-white/tan head which lasts a while.  Aromas of malts, sugars, caramel, and fruits.  Complex flavors of more malts, fruits, and spices.  Its a standard around my household - always a good Belgian to go to that most company will enjoy.  Not too over-the-top with the flavors, but a good balance that works well with most meals.
"
1," Bottled.  Clear pale golden, rich creamy head. Buttery soft malt. Sweet with medum body. A creamy and harmonious malt oriented beer with fairly low bitterness.
"
1," Bottle. Dark amber color, full head. A mild spiciness coupled with yeasty and fruity aromas. A smooth drinking ale, with up front yeast aroma. Mild bite. Very good beer.

1," Good, strong, smooth flavor. Suprisingly smooth for such a dark beer. A good beer to celebrate with, or finish off the evening.
"
1," 12oz bottle from WLV.....pours a darker caramel brown with a thin film of slightly off-white head.... aroma of sweet ripened fruit and sweet confectionary sugars.... expected the flavor to be on the sweeter side but this wasnt the case.  dark fruit, almost a little sour apple in nature, caramel malt, and a little alcohol come together in a not so cleanly way in my eyes.  carbonation level suffices.
"
1," The aroma of this black, sweet stout is all malt.  You can smell the roasted and chocolate malts immediately.  Upon pouring, a thick, brown head develops slowly.  The molasses comes through nicely; just a hint of coffee and chocolate as well.  I would prefer more hops, but this is a tasty, filling stout that does not disappoint.
"
1," Pours deep brown with pillowy white head.  Spiced, sweet candi sugar aroma which carries through the flavor.  Nice alcohol note as well.  The ""Queen"".
"
1," 33cL bottle.  Good Belgian bier, especially considering the mass-production.  I prefer the blue label but this is a quality bier as well.
"
1," 500 ml bottle. Nut brown body with a small white head. Aroma is mostly malt with a hint of smoke. Flavor is sweet malt, ripe fruit and a faint hint of acid. Full body, much to sweet for my taste.
"
1," Reddish/brown hue with a non-stop off-white head and okay lacing. Floral sweet and woody aroma. Hints of roasted malts, nuts, vanilla, spices, and moderate alcohol. Raisin and spice initial taste, some hoppy crispness and woody dryness in finish, smooth and hides alcohol very well. Oily yet lively mouthfeel. As easy to drink Belgian Strong as you will ever find. I liked it 15 years ago and still do today.
"
1," Bottle from BevMo.  Pours a murky dark red-brown color with a huge off-white head. aroma is sweet spices, notably cinnamon and cloves, raisin, light aromatic hops and alcohol. flavor has many roasted notes, yeast, wheat, chocolate, alcohol and the same subdued spiciness as in the aroma. medium alcoholic body with mild, lively carbonation and a gentle bitter aftertaste.
"
1," (Bottle BBE 2010) Yeasty and fruity aroma. Red brown colour, hazy and light brown, large, slightly lasting head with good lacing. Yeasty, slightly sweet, fruity, slightly spicy and acidic flavour. Alcoholic (slightly), medium to full-bodied and fizzy carbonated palate. 04/11/06
"
1," Poured out of a small bottle.  The deep copper color of this beer looks great in the glass (trappist of course), and it has a very pleasing yet subtle fruity aroma.  The balance of this beer is fantastic between the sweet malts, the slightly bitter hops, and the warmingly high (but not overly so) ABV.  There is a little more carbonation than i would prefer from a nice dark beer, but in this case I can definitely make a case for letting that go.  I could definitely drink this every day, its smooth yet full of flavor.  I dont know why I dont drink it more often.
"
1," 12 oz thanks to tytoanderso.  Pours brown black with a tan head.  Nose is roasted malts and coffee grounds with a little chocolate.  A slight creaminess to the flavors that are roasted malts, coffee grounds, nuts and chocolate.  Drinkable and decent.  But nothing special.

"
1," Draft @ brewpub. Is the same exact color as the pils, a glassy straw gold but this with hardly any head. Sweet nutty earthy aroma. Sticky palate. The flavors are mild, pretty dry and malty with some alright wood and malt flavors. Quite boring.
"
1," No head, with ver little carbonation.  Dark dark red.  Aroma has red wine tones, and maybe I can see the toffee/caramel other people mentioned,  Pretty nice flavours, with a big long lingering finish.  Almost syrupy, but smooth.  The alcohol was very mild, although a bit of a kick when it was all gone.
"
1," The aroma is slighly earthy with floral hints.  Chimay Blue pours a deep dark brown with a rich creamy tan head.  The flavor is complex consisting of dark fruit, roasted malt, and bit of yeast.  The finish is mild and smooth.
"
1," Believe it or not, I prefer the white label.  The flavor of this beer is subtle compared to the aggregate sweetness of that beer.  What is excellent about this beer, aside from the general superiority of a Chimay taste, is the beautiful dark color.  Coming from the relatively blonde color of white label to this, a dark reddish brown... I suppose the pale color of the white is one of its less appealing qualities.
"
1," pours a very over-carbonated but pretty amber, with a huge head that is slow to recede, but leaves minimal lace. nose is full of medicinal spiciness, with notes of fruit, earthy hops and alcohol. flavor is quite nice, with a mellow maltiness that is equally balanced by a restrained hop bite, and the yeast tang. mouthfeel is quite light for its strength, as the beer is well attenuated, and the high CO2 content gives further balance. very drinkable for its size.
"
1," I dark amber brew that you have to pour in the proper glass for a beige 1"" head that is long-lasting.  This deep, complex brew has a great roasted malt and slightly bittering hops balance.  There are some slight spices in there, but it mostly tastes like a heavy ale with a great yeast blend that you cant find here.  Great brew but I can brew something similar at about 1/10 of the cost.
"
1,") .... This beer pours black in color with a slightly creamy orange head which lasted nicely. The aroma is vanilla, oak, cocoa, coffee, tree twigs, and heavy black currants. Complex and sweet aroma...very nice. The taste is very oaty, bready and earthy, with chocolate, vanilla, milkiness, heavy bourbon, wood, tree twigs, and cotton candy. Once again, an incredibly complex taste for such an unheard of beer. Dry roasty finish, some sweet vanilla and brown sugar...great mouhtfeel. Very nice BA Oatmeal Stout.
"
1," Clear golden yellow with a thin white head.  Aroma of corn and water.  Taste is more formidable, corny lager, decent light.
"
1," Pours a hazy golden color with a white head. Aromas of bread, dough, flowers, grass and citrus. Excellent flavors of hops and fruitiness with a slightly bitter finish. Medium body with a creamy mouthfeel and lively carbonation that tingles on the tongue.  A very well made tripel, one of my favories.
"
1," A great ale.  It is a bit foamy, so watch out when pouring it.
"
1," Draft @ Cortez beer fest. Orange-amber with thin cap. Rusty, old hop aroma. Smells boring but has a nice earthy, mushroom quality. A really earthy ipa, not bright at all. Almost dull. Goes with food, which brings out the fruity character that is otherwise hidden. Not bad, but certainly not characterful.
"
1," Bought a load of these and found that they were best left for the best part of a year before drinking. Fruity. Spicy. Dark browny reddish colour!! Easy on the tongue. This one has grown on me over the years.
"
1," playing it quiet, actually spare, arid, Im getting nothing at all! Light echoes of nuts and toffee, wafts of maltiness. Not too happy with this aspect.	On first sip, a big blast of hops, with malt following immediately on its heels. We find that this is a brew that must be allowed time to open up, give it a little time and space...shows off earthy, nutty, chocolatey flavors, with a generous amount of zippy, zingy spark on the palate. Taste becomes better, richer, more complex and fruity. Excellent effervescence, featuring that special Belgian spark and yeasty taste. Smooth, though before long the alcoholic component kicks in and rides tall in the saddle.	Ive neglected Chimay for quite some time, perhaps after encountering Ommegang, a better tasting ale, in my opinion, when fresh, and at 1/2 the price. Perhaps Ive got to try this cellaring business to see what an older sample might offer up to us.	On this tasting, a pretty nice drink, but didnt blow me away.
"
1," Pours a transparent mahogany with a thin ring of white head.  Bland aroma of lightly toasty nutty sweet malts.  Body starts lightly sweet with a hint of floral bitterness and some toasted notes, but pretty bland and watery overall with a touch of tartness.
"
1," Was one of my faves when it was made by Gary Lohin. It was BCs best IPA.  I still like it but the recipe has been tweaked by Fab & Franco at Howe Sound. Heres a secret - all the contract brews at Sailor Hagars are exactly whats on tap at Howe Sound - just a different name.  Compare the ratings! That said, its  served with a creamy head, great lace, hops now less citrusy than before, thinner in the mouth.
"
1," SEP 24, 2004 Dark ruby color, medium head.  Aroma of yeast, nuts and raisons.  Flavor of nuts, caramel and raisons.. Gets better as it warms.
"
1," Dark, thick, brown beer under a smallish but foamy head.  This is not my first bottle, but my first in a long while (a 750).  I poured it into a Chimay chalice.  The aroma is fruity, dried dark fruits and apricots, somewhat milky (skim milk smell).  The first taste is a shock of carbonation, too much for me.  Reminds me more of a Salvator than a fine Belgian, not that I don't like Salvator.  The flavor is so lightly roasted as to be quite subtle, almost like a good brown ale.  Fruits dominate, along with floral yeasties and mild but bitter-sweet molasses.  Palate is most pleasing once I get used to the fizzy carbonation, but it seems somehow out of place for a strong-style beer.  I wish the aroma and flavor were as complex as the mouthfeel.
"
1," Let me start out by saying that when I first had Chimay Red about 10 years ago, it was the worst beer I had ever had. I had never had a beer before or since that was worse than that first Chimay Red. Now, ten years later, and a more ""sophisticated"" beer drinker, it was time to give it another shot. And the result.....its a pretty good beer. The aroma isnt much, as it is slightly fruity and yeasty. It is a great looking beer, as it poured a cloudy amber color with a nice off-white head. It has a nice full mouthfeel. Flavor is sweet with a nice caramel, brown sugar, and fruity flavor to it. Not one of my favorite beers, but a much better beer than I thought itd be.
"
1," Bottled - Pigs Ear BF.  A very hazy orange coloured beer with a tight off-white coloured head.  The aroma is heavy with bananas and clove.  Almost too big in the nose really.  The taste is also heavy.  More banana with yeast and wheat.  Quite characterful but too heavy all round really and a bit of a struggle.
"
1," I have a deep respect for this brew. I love the flavorful spicy bite. The preceding ratings are consistent with my opinion.
"
1," Very drinkable.  Flavourful, hoppy but malty, lots of taste, very filling aroma. Malts in the taste to make you go YEAH. Very smooth.
"
1," Head quickly diminishes on this one, but leaves an awesome look in the glass... nice yeasty dark haze, with plenty of yummy yeast particles floating around.  Light melon and apricot to the nose, and the flavor is a bit lighter than I would have expected.  Does not contain the same round mouthfeel as the Blue Label, a bit more fizzy and ""light"" in comparison.  There are notes of caramel and fruit, sizzling from the front of the pull through the finish.  Hops, however insinuated, blend well into the brew.  I agree with some others (""alabamajohn"" below, for instance), this has a definite champagne mouthfeel - almost exactly the same.  It goes down well, without the complexity of its big brother.  Still a good offering here... sorry if I made too many references to the Blue Label, as I rated this Red Label right after it..... maybe a mistake in retrospect.
"
1," Fantastic floral aroma.  great dark color with slightly off white head that is nice and firm.  great thick body with the expected high carbonation levels.  the flavor is wonderfully rich, lots of floral an spce flavors well grounded in the rich malt.  finishes very clean, wonderful beer.
"
1," Pours a deep deep cherry red, with a white creamy head that lingers for most of the drink. Nose is delightfully fruity, but mostly of plums, I would reckon. The taste confirms the fruity aromas with a singular blend of plums, apricot, and cherry. Quite malty with just enough hop bitterness to make the whole thing really refreshing.  Low carbonation so its nice and velvety on the tongue. Finish is a bit astringent but doesnt linger long and is somewhat expected from the style. Very smooth, very fruity, very awesome.
"
1," Very roasty aroma.  Is very, very dark, an opaque black.  Plenty of burnt chocolate and woodiness in the flavor, plus a dry, hoppy finish.  Is a bit thin, but still very enjoyable.
"
1," Pours a ruby red color with large head.  Tastes of fruit (apple), spices (clove and pepper), faint roast, and it has vinous notes to it as well.  Astringent and bitter its a pretty nice brew.

Great selection!

1," Smoky fruity smell, like juniper dropped on a barbecue. Banana ester, burnt applewood, apples. Cloudy orange-brown with no head. Flat medium thick body. Smoky fruity taste, apples, burnt wood. Finish is mild smoky, light burning of the sinuses like standing near a htcdog roast. Smoky after.
"
1," ""Heavy cream scent with accents of cocoa, woody bourbon and vanilla. Sweet with a big creamy push and a fine smoothness. Roasted nuts, fudge, burnt toast and wood.

"
1," Draught at The Railway Club, Vancouver.  Clear mahogany colour. Coffeeish roasty malt aroma. Dryish with notes of nuts and coffee. Medium bodied with delightfully soft mouthfeel. Fairly low bitterness. Plenty of discrete flavours, yet very drinkable - this is a surprisingly good beer!

1," Wine barrels did a number on this beer. The base beer, other than the wine barrel flavors, is not wowing me either. Lots of dark fruit that is a little out of balance. Interesting beer to try, but nothing that I would search out.
"
1," Bottle.  Ok, so I cant believe Ive never rated this, having it so many times, but here goes.  Dark chestnut brown pour with a big, soapy off-white to beige head.  Nose is malty and notably belgian.  Caramel, dark fruit, slight spiciness, subdued hop notes.  Flavor is good - malt, slight smokiness, spicy, light bitterness, anise.  Good, but the aftertaste is a tad oily and leaves an artificial sweetner-like coating in my mouth.  I appreciate this beers quality in relation to its avialability, but I think there are many better BSAs out there, including many of the American ones Ive been able to enjoy.

Fantastic finish, this beer ages amazingly well!

0," I _may_ have had a bad bottle, but it was disappointing to the extreme. Skunky, sour, flat with a nasty palate. Not a beer I willing to try again.
"
1," A dark brown beer with a good head. It has an aroma of fruit and yeast. The flavor is sweet and that of fruits. It tickles the tongue with the high alcohol content, and leaves a mild alcohol almost acidic aftertaste. It has almost no bitterness.  I will have to revisit this beer as it is a style that I enjoy, but yet feel li ke I under rated.
"
1," 750 mL bottle.  Pours a cloudy brown.  Aroma is a bit yeasty, with a bit of a fruity zest coming through.  Flavour is intially spicy, followed by a bitter toastiness.  Carbonation is heavy, but works well with the spiciness and high alcohol content.  On the whole, a nice brew, but nothing superbly unique.

1," This one is now being brewed on contract for Sailor Hagars in North Vancouver.  Nice copper colour with a thin white lace.  Caramel malt and a nice citrus and spicy hop character to balance it out.  Soft mouthfeel and a bit of toffee/caramel becomes prominent in the finish.
"
1,"fruity,raisin,camrale....	Appearance"
1," Bottled. Hazy orangeish colour eith beige bubbly head. Sweet toffeeish plummy aroma with hints of licorace. Sweet sugary and caramelly flavour with hints of licorace. Alcohol grows a bit in the finish.
"
1," Huge head and good lacing on this pour.  Nice bubbles through the Cola color.  Smooth malty flavor without the alcohol bite one expects from a high alcohol brew.  Very pleasant and worth the price!
"
1," MAR 2, 2009 My Bottom Line"
1, Hazy peach with a small head. Nice color. Light lacing.		Aroma 
1," 12 oz. bottle.  Pours a slightly hazy dark amber color with a dense beige head.  The aroma is orange citrus, moderately sweet caramel malt, and a touch of pineapple.  The flavor has a good bit of caramel malt to balance the citrusy hop bitterness.  This one shows good balance and judging by the scores is a little underappreciated IMHO.  Smooth and easy to drink with a medium/full body.  A very solid IPA.
"
1," Not as full flavored as Blue.
"
1," 75 cl bottle - pours hazy amber with tan head and lots of lacing; yeast dominates the aromas; drinks very smooth and is not over-powering; i prefer the red over the blue though
"
1," Clear, light amber orange, white receding head. Light citrus hop aroma.	Big hop taste at first, gives way to some tropical fruit and background malt. Hoppy citrusy finish. Very nice. Not too intense for a Lagerboy.
"
1," This is like a champagne of beer. Very fizzy and bubbly, which gives it a fresh taste over the already well-crafted trappist ale flavor. This was a nice treat.
"
1," 750 ml bottle, poured hazy brown, forming huge off white foamy head.  Aroma slight of bananas, cloves and flowers.  Flavour smooth, banana, spices with a particular floral note.  Interestingly, some hop and malt character comes through as well.  Delicious beer from our friends in Belgium.
"
1," OCT 11, 2009 Taster at Great Lost Bear - Poured a nice coppery dark amber in color with a small off-white head.  Aroma was strong of bready Belgian yeast, fruity esters (dark fruits) and slightly sweet malts.  Flavor followed pretty closely, with some slight hop bitterness to balance things out.  Good...
"
1," AUG 3, 2008 Great beer - absolutely perfect with a good cigar (Fuente Hemingway Best Sellers!). Kick back with those two and life is good!
"
1," Small bottle. What a surprise. Even with my limited experience..I found this beer to be near perfection in a glass This beer was served in a local pub  in the proper Chimay goblet  glass and at the proper  temperature. You dont see that too often. (Other members in my group complained  that their beer was not cold enough !! ) A perfect balance of spices, malts and creaminess. Simply an very enjoyable  drinking experience. You just sip this beer  very slowly as oppose to gulping it. Makes a good  accompaniment with your dinner.
"
1," 75 cl bottle.  Poured with a large off-white head.  The color was a dark and cloudy ruby; very opaque with just a little orange/brown color.  The aroma is light--definite apricot and some yeast too.  The taste is remarkable.  The fruit taste isnt too intense.  The palate of this beer is so pleasant that the taste is secondary.  The flavor is light spice and some fruit.  The finish is smooth and malty.  I could have this stuff for dinner.  This is my first Chimay and I cannot wait to taste the rest.
"
1," JUL 27, 2005 Rating #1 (6/5/02)"
1," plenty of yeast, dried fruits, belgian sugar and spice; hints of citrus and floral hops, but keeping a mild bitterness.  Medium finish, with sugar and tea-like malts.  One of my favorite trappist beers; pairs very well with cigars.
"
1," This is a phenomenal beer. Had it dozens of times. It pours a great dark brown color with a  nice thick head. The aroma is sweet and fruity and the palette is nice and smooth. The taste is very warming this is one of those beers that just makes you feel good to drink it. A must try for any beer fan.
"
1," Poured a clear pale yellow with a decent white head. The nose had a malty sweetness ending with a light mustiness. The taste started with biscuit like malts and a sweet/spicy feel with a hint of hops. The finish was dry with a mild bitterness mixed with some sweet malts. Its OK, not that bad, but one 12 ounce bottle was more than enough.
"
1," Second best beer from Chimay that i have tried. Very tasty beligan beer with amber/copper cloudy color. Well balanced. Good anytime of year
"
1," Bottle, 75 cl. Decent nose, with copious servings of yeast and hops. Very pleasant on the mouth, and if youre someone who prefers the darker ale, then this is a treat. Great beer, great taste.
"
1," Bottle from Getrnke Fritze, BergtheimBlond color; small head retention. Delicate malt and hop aroma. The mouthfeel is quite dry, the flavor simple, but at least it manages to feature a very light malt crispness instead of the usual corn; correct bitterness. Easy but correctly brewed, a valid replacement for a macro Lager.
"
1," slightly cloudy golden-yellow colour, fine head, nice lace, grainy and slightly skunky with only few hops in the nose, sweet and full-bodied with a long herbal finish
"
1," Hazy amber orange, foamy beige head. Aroma is floral, orange, nut, toasty malt, grass, vine, fruit. Taste is nice and tropical, pine, orange peel. More flavor than I was expecting overall.
"
1," Wonderful, distinctive beer. I like the fruity notes in the aroma, and in the overall taste. I think the beer is malty enough to balance out the fruitiness very nicely. Looks all amber loveliness in the tumbler. Just a splendid beer.
"
1," 33cL bottle.  Poured a beautiful deep ruby with a well-retained creamy beige head.  Nose picked up boatloads of deep, dark fruits (plums, raisins), musty Belgian yeast, and a little bit of alcohol.  Flavor was able to take all that is great with the aroma, and really make it dance... dark fruit provided a sweet and salivating base, yeast gave the brew some spicy and musty character, and the alcohol was nicely warming at the top of the throat.  Balance was superb.  Smooth and velvety on the palate.  Finish was peppery, warm, and long-lasting.  This brew was excellent on all fronts!
"
1," Definately one of the best beers I have tasted.  Its deep aroma and flavor gives it an edge over other beers of its kind.  The blue is also the best Chimay that you can buy.
"
1," not sweet as some can be, but then again its not got any distinctive flavors either. Quaffable and pretty good.
"
1," Very sweet barleywine on the malty side of the style. Complex, but still too young when I sampled it.
"
1," belgian strong ale produced in the abbaye of scourmont.sold in 33cl and 75 cl bottle.dark colour with off-white head.aroma of fruit and toasted malt.flavour is really balanced with taste of caramel,toffee and fruit.leaves a pleasant alcoholic taste and a nice bitterness.despite being 9% its really drinkable.maybe my favourite beer
"
1," (650ml bottle) Purchased at the Sailor Hagars Off-Sale for ~$5. Lasting foamy almond-coloured head with a ruby body. Pleasant roasteed malt and slight coffee flavours. This is a good contender. I like the solid beers made by Howe Sound.
"
1," Sweet, almost fruity start, with unique dry finish, beautiful pour, stellar
"
1," The alcohol taste is very prominent. The taste does have a certain lightness to it though. Has spicy notes to it. Dark red with some sediment and medium lacing. Had something in the flavor that just didnt taste right to me. Good, but not great.
"
1," Nice hop aroma.  Nice maltiness in the body, with a slight hop bite.  Finishes a little to the dry side.
"
1," Nice golden cider with light applae and alcohol aroma. Very tart apples in mouth, with astringent qualities, very puckering. Thinish and light. May 2005.
"
1," Smooooooooth plus everything else jefcon said in his May 31,2005 review.  Really good, and the 9% certainly sneaks up and kicks you from behind!
"
1," Tasted at the Beer of Summer event at Oldsmar Tap House. Another decent IPA. pours a decent looking burnt orange with a light white head. decent citrus aroma with grapefruit and pine notes. pretty good taste, hoppy, citrus taste to start, then a bitter malty finish. medium mouthfeel, with a clamy mouthfeel. pretty decent.
"
1," SEP 20, 2005  Excellent beer.  The aftertaste is magnificent.  The only thing is the small bottle is not even close to as good as the big bottle.  The cork must make the difference.  If that werent the case I would give it a 19 or 20.  The pour and aroma are great. Malt and banana are very present in the taste and the aroma.  The aftertaste tastes like rum raisin.  Very impressive beer that will give you a nice buzz.
"
1," One of the first beers I had when I started getting curious about craft beer. I enjoy the balance of this beer as well as the finish.
"
1," Dark amber coloured, thin foamy off-white layer; fruity -malty nose with traces of roasted malt and hops; slightly sweetish and bitter flavour; soft lingering aromatic hoppy finish with distinctive traces of toasted malt and a citrousy fruitiness. Light to medium bodied, rather well made....
"
1," Bottle at the Febmergency tasting. Pours cloudy golden orange with beige head. The aroma is sweet caramel, grain, and some spicy hops. The flavor is sweetish caramel malt, some fruity hop notes. The finish is sweet. Decent, but needs more assertive bitterness.
"
1," Dark with thin tan head that quickly disapates.  Nice aroma.  Drinks very smooth, sweet with good balance of coffee and chocolate.  My first beer from Barley Island, and definately will go back and try others.
"
1," The strongest - and the best of the Chimay brews - to my taste. A good sweetness makes a rounded beer. Good hops gives a long finish, that turns dry, after a while.
"
1," Bottle (330 mL). Pours a bold, dark cloudy brown with thin white head. The aroma is strong plum with some flower petals and hints of bitter chocolate and yeast. I took a pretty deep sniff and the alcohol burned my sinuses a bit. The flavor is semi-dry, vinous plum, yeasty bread. It has a level bitterness across the board, but the finish gets kind of sweet, like caramel malt, and the aftertaste is almost like cocoa. The alcohol is very apparent, but not aggressive. This is a very multi-dimensional beer and comes together very well. Cheers.
"
1," Upon dumping this into a trappist glass it appeared to have a dark redish brown with a ton of yeast particles in it. There is a rather thin tan head that leaves some laceing along the sides of the glass. It has a nice sewwt malty aroma of dark fruits and bitter hops. as i sip on it there is a nice warming flavor of fig and dark fruits that overwelm your mouth, but there is a drying finish to it. overall this is a great beer although i have been drinking this for years i forgot that i have never rated it.
"
1," Sparkling gold head is gone immediately. Light piney hop nose and fore, hint of malt in mid. Medium hop finish. Lacks carbonation
"
1," bottle from bierpost. Cloudy orange colour, mid-sized off-white head. Perfumy hop aroma. Slightly grainy, malty sweetness with shy hints of caramel. Hints of coriander and spices, getting quite hoppy towards the finish. There is a very faint smoke flavour in the very far background. Lingering, perfumy, floral, slightly fruity hoppy finish that leaves delicious and nearly chewable bitter traces on the tongue. Unusal at first, delicious after the second sip.
"
1," NOV 24, 2005 Awesome beer.  Good for a lazy afternoon in any weather.  Just dont let the high alcohol creep up on you...  Pours a tea-brown with a nose of spice.  Flavor is fruity with a hints of winter spice and wood.  The flavors flow nicely on the tongue, like a smoothly running stream.  Finish is slightly congnac-esque.  Good stuff.
"
1," FBG07. Sweet malt nose, some smokey caramel. Amber brown, bubbly but thin white head. Biting palate, dry as all hell. Some sweetness but watery.
"
1," JUL 25, 2006 Poured into a wide glass from a 2/06 bottle.  My best efforts could not thwart the large foamy head.  Color was an opaque muddy brown with hints of red and yellow. Very pleasing complex aroma.  Hints of sweet floral bouqet mixed with a malty undertone.  Flavor bears a light/medium sweetness with a floral overtone and a malty aftertaste.  This beer is mildly hopped with a slight bitter flavor throughout.  At 9%, there is a subtle initial impression of alchohol flavor, which becomes less apparent in the aftertaste.  This is an above average beer with possibly the best aroma I have enjoyed.  I looking forward to buying more to age!
"
1," IPA is always my beer of choice.  Barely Island Barfly has the best aroma and flavor of all that I have sampled.
"
1," Deep, dark copper color with a short lived foamy head.  Smooth, fruity overtones with a slightly bitter finish mellowing, again, into a refreshing fruity aftertaste.
"
1," 75cl bottle @ home. Dark ruby/brown colour, creamy beige head. Aroma of dark fruit, yeast and chocolate, some alcohol. Flavours are dark fruits/raisins, caramel/brown sugar, bread. Lively carbonation, but still a soft mouthfeel. Too sweet imho, nevertheless enjoyable.
"
1," Found it to be a good Belgian Abbey ale, just wasnt bowled over by it, because it seemed slightly subdued.
"
1," OCT 28, 2007 11 ounce bottle purchased at The Fresh Market Pembroke Pines, FL.. Very good
"
1," Pours dark amber red, a bit hazy with a big frothy moccha head, which recedes quickly to a moderate one finger thickness.	Nose sulphury, easty, moderately fruity and a bit leathery, some prunes and raisins	Mouthfeel is very thick, viscous, big. This beer almost askes to be chewed. First flavours which hit you are big malt, biscuit,	pear, quite dry with minor residual sweetness. Spicy/peppery with some hint of raisins and pleasant alcohol warmth, slightly vinous. Finishes with a touch of roasted dryness, light but noticeable. Hop bitterness is very low, although aided with a light roasted character, overall impression is balanced but on a sweet side. A lot of subtleties which can potentially unfold with aging. My favourite beer!
"
1," Copper pour with white head and lace. Caramel malt and earthy hops aroma. Caramel malt with a nice light bitter. Medium bodied with good carbonation. Pretty nice beer.
"
1," Bottle; Pour is a dark, hazy brown/amber with a modest off white head. Retention is light, lacing is nonexistant in this Chimay glass. Brown sugars, raisins, sweet breads on the nose. Light spice note, dark fruits, brown sugars, mild hop presence, mouth feel is medium , finish is slightly bitter but the sweetness is present throughout the flavor profile. This is my kind of Belgian -
"
1," Sampled on draft at the Music City Brewers Festival.  Pours clear amber.  Sweet caramel and corn.  Decent to style I suppose, but still way too sweet for my taste.  Medium syrupy body.
"
1," (Bottle from Tescos, Diss) Poured dark with a hint of reddiness, and no head. A big smell with fruit, vanilla, and a bit of tartness. Had a high carbonation, and tasted fruity, with a good malt base and elements of herbs, spices, bread. Generally sweet with a bitterness coming in towards the end. A decent beer I could drink much more of. Complex but not over the top for regular drinking. Very good.
"
1," 33cl. bottle. Its been a long time since I had this. It tasted better than I remember. Reddish brown with frothy white/tan head. Flavors of bread, raisin, spices. Sweet with mild bitterness.
"
1," Draft at brewpub. Poured clear brown pour with a moderate off-white fizzy head that lasted and had good lacing. Solid toasted malt aroma. Medium body. Good toasted malt flavor with a medium bittersweet finish of moderate duration. Good drinkable brew.
"
1," Poured thick and coppery with a thin white head. Aroma very light, citris, but body tasted thick and rich. Complex flavors here... more going on than my palate can name, but overall a very balanced and pleasing drink..
"
1,")
"
1," raisin, banana, cloves. Sweetish flavor with a rather bitter finish to it. A good beer to savor slowly.
"
1," Draught at All Colorado Beer Festival.  Pours clear amber with a spare, fizzy, off-white head, diminishing with spare lacing.  Aroma is average malt (cookie, caramel), light hops (herbs, grass), average yeast (dough, meat) with notes of dates and toffee.  Medium bodied, slick texture, soft carbonation, and a bitter finish.  Average duration, moderate sweetness, acidity, and bitterness.
"
1," Tap at BI - Aroma is smokey toasted malts, caramel, toffee, peat and campfire.  Pours dark brown with a small lasting head and good lacing.  Flavor matches aroma.  Palate is dry and ashy.  I like the full bodied smokiness of this brew.  A lot better than their regular Scotch Ale (hint hint).
"
1," Nice malty aroma with some funky yeast notes--tennis shoes, spices. Pours with a decent, quicky attenuating head over a fairly dark amber beer. Has a nice solid, sweet malty body, a touch of bitter hoppiness, and some crisp notes from the yeast--cloves, maybe coriander?
"
1," FINALLY!!! A great locally bottled non-brewpub beer that I can make my regular tap. On tap at the Crescent Moon beginning in December of 2009. I hope to enjoy this for a long time. This is actually a bit better than SN Celebration. Incredible pine and cedar and fresh cut grass to the aroma. Rich and deep scent that is simply a delight to inhale. The flavor is big for a single IPA. Lots of grapefruit citrus and green hop taste, but also has the malt sweetness to the body to pull all this off successfully. This IPA can totally hold its own against many of the California Big Boys. And for me, the carbon footprint is low! Zack has hit another home run with this one. I hope the recipe does not get ""tweaked!""
"
1," After 2 years of spending $75 a week on Belgian beers, I have narrowed my favorites down to St Bernardus (1st) and Chimay (2nd).		I can really enjoy any of the St Bernardus or Chimay beers.
"
1," Very little aroma.  Slight maltiness w a touch of hops.
"
1," Quite simply my favourite beer in the world. Have had this on draught in my bar & would keep it on permanently if I didnt think Id drink too much of it. Easy-drinking for its strength, beautiful, lasting head, slightly sparkling taste to it. Just fantastic, like a stronger Orval.
"
1, Burned malt with typical cherry alcohol  notes. Little yeasty. Sip 
1," Bottle. Dark brown colour with a nice beige head. Aroma and flavour of yeast, spice, caramel, malt and dark fruit.
"
1," Hazy dark amber with a nice soapy head. Lt. hops with a green spice flavor reminiscent of cloves. Better than the White, but not as good as the Blue.
"
1,Light chocolate and coffe nose...	Appearance
1," 22 oz bomber from Josh.  Deep, dark brown color with a slight tan head.  Very subtle aromas, slightly hoppy with a touch of dark fruit.  Difficult to pick out much from the aroma.  Flavor is also very subtle which made it very hard to pick out exact notes, more hops with some dark fruit.  The finish had a touch of oakiness to it but  is what made things more difficult because it was very dry and made the flavors disappear very quickly.  Interesting and unique beer but was just tough to break down for us.
"
1," Bottle 75 cl. Pours a deep plum colour with a thin white head, the aroma is malty with plenty of fruit and some spice, the taste is also malty with fruit., with a smooth finish.
"
1," bottle thanks to thirdeye11.  deep amber with a thick cream head.  nose is hops, raisins, fruits, wood and a light tartness in the back.  smooth on the palate with flavors of fresh hops, raisins, wood, syrup, and light alcohol.
"
1," 12 ounce bottle.  Pitch black with a lasting brown head.  Smells like a morning breakfast.  Strong black coffee, and a bowl of Quaker Oats.  Nice.  This is a sturdy beer.  Oatmeal stout flavor with a coffee kicker.  Not the other way around.  Very nice.  Creamy on the palate.  Easy going finish.  Thanks to BBB63 for the hookup.
"
1," Nice yeastiness with a bit more alcohol than the other two chimays. Feels more carbonated on the mouth. Good balance and has an almost earthy characteristic to it.  Quite good -- my favorite Chimay.
"
1," Draft at Downtown Chattanooga location		Poured a deep ruddy color with an almost white head. Aroma was hidden so well had to foam my nose to find it, but nice when I found it. Flavor is light bodied for the style, but has nice toasted malt and bread flavors as expected.
"
1, Lots of hops and malt. 	Appearance
1," DEC 1, 2006 Very hazy dark brownish/reddish/amber color.  Initially a coarse foamy tan-colored head, settled after awhile and turned to a light layer of fine bubbles on the surface.  Fairly light malty, spicy, fruity, floral aroma.  Nice strong array of flavors"
1," Bottle.  Nose is strong citrus, sparkling golden malt, lager yeast.  Clear yellow-golden with a sudsy, brilliantly white head.  Taste has some drive-by grains and rough patches, but the mellow crispness with layered maltiness throughout more than makes up.  Medium-body with firm but low bitterness, above-avg mineral content, and mild pricks of spicy yeast.  Hops add an earthy floral component but are backed way off.  Clean and well-made.
"
1," Pours dark with a hint of red color.  Small white head.  Yeasty nose. Tastes like caramel with hints of fruit.  Definite alcohol in the finish.
"
1," Draft at Downtown Chattanooga location		Wow is this phenolic. Im not a fan of wheats in general, and this was over the top with bandaid, clove, and banana.
"
1," JUL 12, 2006 This and the Abbaye des Rocs Gran Cru are my favorite in this style.  Pours dark brown, almost black.  Aroma of cherries and dark fruit.  Also lots of roasted malt.  It just smells rich.  Taste is incredibly well balanced.  I look forward to every taste as I enjoy this baby.  Chimay is not as sexy as other, harder to find Belgians, but its hard to do better than this one.
"
1," OCT 11, 2009 A strong cherry-apple aroma - could not detect any other aroma.  Dark brown color with ample brown head.  Taste is spectacular - a perfect balance of fruity sweetness and malt.  Nice full body.
"
1," Pours dark mahogany with a nice head. Smells fruity and yeasty. Full-bodied with raisin, chocolate, and spicy flavors. Very complex; great beer...it is what it is...
"
1," This brew pours a semi cloudy straw yellow colour with a nice head that has aromas of coriander, spice and a little cloves. Mouthfeel is light and it finishes very smooth with a soft hop drop. Overall tastey, i hear its better than last years batch.
"
1," 12 oz. bottle from West Lakeview Liquors.  Absolutely gushed upon opening.  Pours a cloudy brown color with a massive beige head.  Upon smelling after the gushing settled, this showed some funky, fruity, brett-like character, which leads me to believe it may have been infected.  Either that, or they were shooting for something more like New Glarus Unplugged Old English Porter.  Anyway, I still wound up liking this, as along with the brett and fruit, there are some good barrel notes of vanilla, caramel malts, bourbon, and oak, and some roasty porter character.  Medium-bodied, with a tart, roasty mouthfeel and tons of frothy carbonation.  Infected?  Maybe, but still interesting and good.
"
1," Pours an impressive ruby brown, w/ a nice Belgian head.  Taste is a perfect balance between sweet malts & sugar, and a slight alcohol pucker.  Very well done.
"
1," Considering that this came in a giant corked bottle - I was more than slightly disappointed at the average-ness of the taste.
"
1,	Kinda simple fruit beer in which the blueberry remains very subtle. Not aimed at a ratebeerian public.		I like
1," 11.2 oz bottle.  Deep cloudy brown with a nice tan head that does not fade away.  Fruity aroma, but the taste is not overly sweet/fruity like some Belgians Ive tried.  Smooth ale, very enjoyable.  Will have to get the big bottle next time.
"
1," hazy, dark orange, medium carbonation. I think still a classic dubbel.  The dark friuits play nicely with malt sweetness and a subtle spiciness.  note - put a cork in it and finished the next day and it was still pretty damn good.
"
1," bottle
"
1," APR 28, 2010 Had this a few times now and I think it deserves a nudge upward.  Just tried it out of the 25cl bottle at Zephyr in Juneau and really dug the yeast chunks, the belgian sugary mildness but with the extra alcoholic kick at the end.  Belgian ales are not astounding me as they once were, but the quads like this one are still awesome.
"
1," 12 oz bottle from Princetons.  Cloudy caramel pour with a thin white head.  Aroma and flavor have dark fruit and yeasty notes.  Very pleasant sweet finish.
"
1," 11.2 oz Bottle. Pours a murky brown color with whipped cream fluffy tan head. The aroma is really difficult to pick up. I get just a sense of sweetness and spice. The aroma could be a bit more assertive. The taste is smooth malts, brown sugar and spice (maybe cinnamon and a bit of pepper). Really smooth. So much so that I cant pick out distinct flavors. Can a beer be too smooth?  Nay!
"
1," This is the standard dubbel I pretty much started my Belgian ale tasting career on. Available at just about any liquor store with a good beer selection. Not much to say here that hasnt already been said about its character. A decent brew with good a good rich fruit nose on the flavor and a soft palate, however there are many Belgians out there much more worth seeking than this.
"
1," Bottle. Poured a ruby red. Nose is very yeasty with light malts. Very mild and subtle with fruity notes. Creamy mouthful almost buttery, with classic Belgian candied sugars and yeasts. Not too sweet, almost dry. This is fairly mild and smooth, with the subtle but well crafted flavors.
"
1," FEB 12, 2003 vinous earthy peppery nose with a bit of licoriche.   strong full bodied yeasty taste with candy, rasion and mild hops. A solid beer
"
1," MAY 2, 2003 One of the greatest disappointments in my beer drinking career. Cloudy brown color. Head is initially very thick and attractive but mostly diminishing leaving little lace. Yeasty aroma with overly-sweet malty flavor. Hints of smoke maybe a little fruit. Alcohol is apparent in both flavor and aroma. Slight alcohol burn in the throat but nicely carbonated. Don't get me wrong, this beer is good but aside from champagne corks and a 4.2+ score on ratebeer it really didn't impress me.
"
1," 22oz bottle from StFun. Thanks, Josh. Nice brown pour, with some glinting red in the appearance and a lively carbonation. The nose was rich and very fruity, and this more or less characterizes the taste as well. I was expecting something with more bitterness, and some roasted flavors. This actually comes across far more like a dubbel than anything else, though certainly an enjoyable one. Lively mouthfeel, tasty blend of ripe dark fruits and malts, long finish. Tasty beer.
"
1," A very good tasting beer and very strong.  Has a lot of taste and a noticable taste of alcohol.  A strong beer that is good for sipping.
"
1," 0,5 l bottle shared with Rune in the brewpub 22 Jun 07. Golden colored. Unclear. A large creamy head. Fruity aroma. Soft citric flavor. Sweet finish.
"
1,"  Lightly hazed deep amber color with a very long lasting medium sized off-white head.  Light citrus aroma that turns to malty nose.  Some dusty dry notes.  The flavor was moderately citrusy with some candy notes and sweet caramel.  Smooth typical cask condition mouthfeel.
"
1," 33cL bottle in Brussels. Pours a hazy brown red. Smells of yeast and light alcohol. Very fine mouthfeel with extremely fine carbonation. Light-to-medium body; feels smooth and caramelized. Taste has some malted barley notes with a slight fruity taste (a bit of cantelope), and a boozy character. A great beer.
"
1," Yawn. Pale ales can be boring as it is, and this one falls into that general pool of beer. Take it or leave it; its not bad but its not great either.
"
1," Again, I drank this beer last week at Sailor Hagars.  		An excellent balance of grapefruity hops and tobacco notes, ending juicy and bitter with notes of apples.
"
1," Bottle 50cl. @ home. [ As Andorfer Weizendoppelbock Claudiator ]. Unclear sparkling medium orange amber color with a huge, frothy, excellent lacing, fully lasting, off-white head. Aroma is moderate malty, wheat, caramel, moderate yeasty, strange sharp yeast, banana - rubber. Flavor is moderate to heavy sweet and moderate rubber bitter with a average to long duration. Body is medium, texture is creamy, carbonation is soft to lively, finsh feel is light to moderate alcoholic. [20090603]

1," I missed Janet's ""costume malfunction"" while pouring this because Justin made me walk away from the TV.  turns out it was worth pouring over any part of the game!  nice and darker than the red, light candy sugar flavors like a true trappist at 9%.  good fruity notes and happy finish.
"
1," Skunky, grain/toast aroma.  Green bottle, awkward label, generic lager yellow with foamy white head.  Lots of nutty bittering, an overbrewed Saaz character which I found unpleasant, but outside of that a very unremarkable brew and generally unremarkable across the board.  Yawn.
"
1," Brown pour, hazy with a light tan head.  Chocolate and alcohol aroma.  Chocolate malt flavor with some alcohol on the finish.  Very mellow and easy to drink despite the alcohol content.  Didnt think it was really anything special.
"
1," Bottle at Highland House.	Copper with  a white head. Light sweet (caramel, roasted), moderate acidic/bitter. Light body.
"
1," Hazy, deep amber coloured, rather quickly collapsing off-white head; sourish dark-malty nose; moderate sweetish-sourish flavour, medium bodied, soft; almost adstringent acidity in the lemony-caramelly finish. O.K., not overwhelming.....
"
1," Dirty and astringent nose. Nice color with big carbonation. Dried dark fruit notes are very well hidden.Starchy mouthfeelwith an acidic finish.
"
1," bottle thanks to sigma23.  poured black with a tan/copper head that stays for the life of the beer.  aroma was chocolate, slight bourbon, some faint coffee, seemed to have a slight presence of vanilla.  flavor was bitter coffee, dark roasts, some bourbon but not much.  body was about medium with high carbonation.  not bad at all.  thanks for the bonus tim!!

1," .33l bottle. Rouge color with a creamy white head. Very nice smell of malt and raisins. Average lacing. Taste is of sweet raisins and cream, wood, and berries. What a loveable beer that can be savored over and over.
"
1," 750ml bottle.  Obvious signs of bottle fermentation.  Nice copper colour, tan head.  I have to admit, I was pretty ignorant on this style going in, and so I was very surprised to find in this Belgian beer a great malt character, with hints of bitterness to balance it out.  The carbonation was perfect, and the alcohol was not even noticeable.  Im not sure what I was expecting, but this was very good, maybe without being truly outstanding.
"
1," Bottle. Pours a cloudy dark brown with a medium off white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is dark fruit, yeast, sweet malt, alcohol - delicious. Taste is dark fruit, sweet bready malt, finish of semi-sweet dark fruit lingers on the back of the tongue. Palate is moderately carbonated. Definite alcohol presence.
"
1," All of the Vhimary products are very good. Apricot is present in both the smell and the taste. Very creamy, and smooth. Full of flavor like its siblings.
"
1," Bottled. I had to wait for the beer to warm-up somewhat before pouring (it was too cold out of the fridge). Poured  dark reddish-brown,hazy, with an ample tan head. Aroma of sweet malt and trappist yeast. Deeply malty flavour with fruity (raisins, prunes) and caramel notes. A touch of sweetness balanced with light bitterness. Complex aroma and flavour unfolded as the beer warmed. Alcohol was detectable but did not detract from the flavour. This brew had a long dry finish with light hop bitterness. An outstanding trappist ale.
"
1," Poured from a 12-oz bottle with a smallish white head. Poured an amber color, a little cloudy. A nice biscuit malt aroma. Taste of sweet malts. A good offering.
"
1," APR 21, 2007 Strong, complex, but not overwhelming.  Just an overall great ale that fits in on almost any occasion.  Beautiful pout, nice aroma of light fruit and fresh malts.  A pleasure to sip!
"
1," 31-DEC-2009, bottle.	I quite like the blue, so what can the red do?	Brown, off-white head.	Definately belgian. Brown sugar and sweet, very sweet, actually too sweet.	 This is dissapointing. I was expecting much more from this. No rebuy.
"
1," Hazy caramel color with big, foamy off-white head / Nose of pine, caramel, and citrus / Medium body, with good malts and sharp, biting hops, and good finish / Muted but solid flavors of cut pine, caramel, grapefruit / A very fine ipa, reminiscent of a double in body.
"
1," Big thanks to TAR for this one!  22 oz bomber acquired in a trade!  Impressive lasting chocolate brown head on a dark chocolate brown body.  First whiff is watered down whiskey/bourbon.  Beyond that its chocolate, light roasty malt with a very, very subdued raisiny dark fruit character.  Toasted oatmeal when it warms along with oak woody notes and hints of vanilla.  Very smooth complex aroma IMHO!  Well balanced flavor with roasty & vanilla flavor; Chocolate & caramel  with resiny hop. Whiskey in the finish & aftertaste, but more subtle than the aroma.  finish is on the malty sweet side.  Minimal fruitiness.  Medium high carbonation...way too much for the type of beer that this is.  A little dry in the mouth, very thin, probably due to over carbonation.  A little thin in the mouth, but overall I think a very fine beer!  Great nose, above average palate, but the body killed the overall experience for me.
"
1," Dark brown with a tan foamy head. Malty nose similar to Aventinus wiezenbock. Spice & fruit flavors.
"
1," JUL 19, 2011 Trs rafraichissante avant tout. Le fruit de la levure trs caractristique, sans surprise mais trs efficace.
"
1," Copper color, off white frothy head. Buttery, malty aroma and flavor. Mango, grapes, fresh cheese, licorice and hops fight for attention. Interesting, good looking beer with an odd, but fine flavor. Maybe a bit thin.
"
1," Pours opaque with a fading head that left some lace on the glassware. The nose detects a lot of espresso, roasted and burnt malt, oat, chocolate, plum, a hint of pepper, and grassy hops. The taste profile is one that starts coffee-ish and mostly stays that way throughout the tasting. What helps is an addition of fruity rind acidity and some hop character along with a dash of ashy yeast character. The finish is quite bitter and dry. The mouth feel is thinner than that of the regular Oatmeal stout for some reason, maybe the coffee bitterness gives a sense of thinness. It is very oily however. A good brew and I like it because I like coffee stouts but the average person may not care for a much, not subdued for sure.
"
1," deep orange with a perfectly formed white head. Hops are quite obvious in the aroma, but not necessarily intense. Its floral with grapefruit and some evergreen as well. The hoppiness is more pronounced in the flavor. Lucky Bucket has made a really nice, dry and hoppy brew. This is quite resinous with pleasing piney notes all over.
"
1," Sorry if I'm being sacrilegious, but I just can't see what all the fuss is about with this one. Sure, its quite a nice beer, but seriously over-hyped in my view.  There's not much I can say in the way of description that hasn't been said a hundred times before. Definite prune/raisin and dark chocolate character. However, what comes through more than anything else is the caramelly candy sugar that gives it an oddly synthetic feel and a slightly cloying finish. All this may give the impression that I didn't like it. That is certainly not so, but, in my opinion, there are plenty of better Belgian strongs out there. Bottled (330ml).
"
1," Black pour, head of tan with sticky lace.   Strong coffee component in aroma and taste.  Good, but missing some complexity.
"
1," pours an amber color.  floral scent with belgian yeast and carmel.  taste is the same with some roast as well.  Alcohol is well hidden as well.  I would purchase again.
"
1," JUN 21, 2009 This ale can be described  using just one word"
1," Bottle. Dark amber, clear, decent tan head. Little aroma of caramel, nuts, toast. Light body, soft carbonation. Taste of toffee, nuts, a little hops.	An ok nut brown, nothing more.
"
1," 12 oz. poured into shaker (purchased at Liquor Barn- Louisville, KY)- poured transparent orange/amber color, small off white head formed and quietly bubbled away with some lacing, low carbonation.  Aroma of floral hops, citrus, and malt.  Hits the mouth with a low-medium body, malt comes in at first but quickly transforms into hops that strike the back on the tongue.  Finish has a tendency to drop off, sharply.  Its welcome in my fridge anytime.
"
1," On draft at the Hamilton Place location. Pretty standard micro brew light lager. Mostly inoffensive, except for a slight cardboard note.
"
1," AUG 2, 2006 Poured from the 11.2 ounce bottle to an orangey brown color, with one finger tan head which quickly faded to a thin tan cap. Lacing was excellent. The aroma was malty and dark fruit, mostly grapes and alcohol. As the glass warmed, the alcohol became much more evident in the smell. Ditto for the taste. At first, the flavor was slight malty sweetness, and pleasant clove spices. At mid-glass, the alcohol became the dominant taste. The finish, whiile pleasant, was warming and again, dominated by alcohol.		In conclusion, I enjoyed this beer, and it is definitely a classic rappist Ale. I might drink another on a cold winters night (instead of todays 90+ dgree weather). But at only 9% abv, the alcohol was a little too noticeable in taste and smell, as I felt more like I was drinking shots of whiskey.
"
1," POurs hazy straw with sweet notes of malt that show off very light hints of hops.  It drinks smooth and has a flavor from the malt that seems distracting.  Better than your mass lagers.
"
1," Excellent beer, the thing I love the most is that non-beer drinkers enjoy it thoroughly.  For a beer with such a high alcohol content it has a very subdued alcohol taste.  Somewhat of a clove taste in the palate.  Wonderful beer.
"
1," Bottle.	Clear golden coloured with a small white head.	Malty aroma of caramel and hay with notes of hops.	Malty flavour of caramel, hay and hops.	Hoppy finish.
"
1," Thick, dark, black body with no head.  Metllic, matly aroma -  its not really that great. just OK.  The flavor is surprising filled with bitter cocoa, and roasted malts.  I really dont detect anything oatmealish about this beer.  Slightly sweet finish.  Very light and refreshing, and would go well with food.
"
1," Aroma consists of... raisin cookies!  Awesome...  Dark cloudy leather brown in appearance.  Slightly sweet yeasty malt flavor and very effervescent on the palate.  Overall  this is smooth, drinkable and awesome.
"
1," 19.09.2004, 0,33l Bottle. 2003 edition. The colour is brown. Rich beer that tastes a lot. Aroma is dark-malty. Sweet.
"
1,"	This quaffable Pale Ale focuses on its amiable union of citrusy, leafy hops and lightly honeyed malts to offer a clean and easily approachable brew for long evenings.		Further Personal Perceptions"
1," This brew poured a small head of large light brown mostly lasting bubbles that left behind an excellent lacing and a semi-opaque uncarbonated dark black brown colored body behind.  It had a very nice caramel aroma and a strong coffee flavor with some noticible caramel.
"
1," Aroma of plums and dates with a slight hint of malt.  Medium tan head with some noticeable lacing.  Fruit flavor of plums and raisins with the alcohol hidden well.   Somewhat sour across the palate with a slight aftertaste of citrus.
"
1," KegHazy blond color; generous head. Nice hop aroma. Quite malty body, with a good hopping and good hop aromas; very good final as well, dry, strongly bitter, well aromatic.
"
1," 750mL Magnum poured into a snifter.  Pours dark brown, cloudy, with a large beige head that fades pretty fast.  Aroma is very belgian.  It smells malty and yeasty with an earthy quality.  Theres just a hint of alcohol in the background.  Take a sip and its very creamy, but not too thick.  Flavor is very much like a red wine or even a port.  Theres a touch of alcohol warmness, but its held nicely in place by the incredible sweetness of this brew.  It finishes quite dry and leaves a nice aftertaste of sweet grapes and raisins.  Very good beer.
"
1," Pours a murky iced-tea brown with a quickly dissipating khaki head. Aroma of lemon, tea, clove, malt, floral hops, and yeast. Flavor is caramel, malt, currants and a touch of floral hops. A little too prickly for my taste. There is a lot going on here, but overall its well balanced.
"
1," JAN 8, 2006 Cloudy light brown (slight amber accent) with bone-coloured head.  Aroma of raisin bread (candi sugar), brown sugar, plums, and a little nuttiness.  Flavour starts sweet (apple pie, plum, raisin), picks up a bit of demerara accent, then turns more yeasty with a bit of dustiness and astringency late.  Alcohol comes in at the end to dry it up.
"
1," Sorry thedm, but I call them the way I smell them!! If my remark influenced your decision, I apologize. This is rating #300 for me!! This beer poured a medium tan head with fine sized bubbles. Yes, the nose did remind me of vomit. The body was murky and there was carbonation observed. The hue was that of cider and the lacing was sparse on the sides of my glass. The flavor was spicy and the mouthfeel was smooth and tingly on my tongue.
"
1," Red pour.  Caramel and toast.  Bready notes with caramel, honey and light hops.  Thanks hellbilly!
"
1," Bottle, 6.3%. Peppery banana aroma. Muddy grey/brown colour. OK bubbly head. Rather peppery and yeasty flavour. Soft mouthfeel in spite of high carbonation.
"
1," 33cl bottle.  Pours an average, frothy, off-white head.  Has a muddy, burnt red body with generous yeast particulate.  Heavy malt aroma of caramel, plum, cherry and some grape.  Fairly abundant yeast phenol presence - nice spiciness.  A little fruitiness from the esters.  Medium body balanced by lively carbonation and a light hop bitterness.  Candi sugar dry finish keeps the caramel malts in check.  Pleasant, warming alcohol lingers.  Surprisingly easy drinking and tasty, though not quite as interesting as I had hoped.
"
1," wonderful beer that is, for the most part, easily accessible. has a nice texture and a good balance of flavor, leaving you with a very satisfying taste in your mouth. enjoy this one and compare for yourself!
"
1," Big bottle. Nice red-brown colur with a big fluffy tan head. Aroma of malt indeed, sweet with a good fruitiness. The flavour has roasted malts, dark fruits, caramel, some alcohol. Long somewhat bitter aftertaste.
"
1," FEB 5, 2007 (Bottle) Pours a bit hazy redish brown. Spicy and fruity aroma with apples, some alcohol and yeast. Undertones of caramel, banana, herbs, malt and sugar. A bit sourish in the nose and taste. Light spicy, malty flavour with some fruits and just a touch of roasted and bitter tones. Meduim sweet. Pretty creamy mouthfeel. Medium body.
"
1," FEB 28, 2008 Pretty good Oatmeal Stout. I would have this again for sure. Doesnt rate up with Sam Smiths and Milk Stout, but would fall in the next group below the elite (not a bad place to be). Not terrible thick, but not watery. Aroma is nice, again not too strong but not weak. Flavor is better than I expected. Nice and multi-dimensional. Nice mix of malt, oats, and grains in this one. Creamy and smooth. Tasty!
"
1," Fruity aroma and taste.  Shared a 1pt6oz bottle and determined apple was the predominant fruit flavor in our minds. Very sweet like you would expect but didnt manage to have to heavy a mouth feel like some of the other belgian ales.   Alcohol was well hidden.
"
1," Bottle. Dark brown colour with a huge head. Aroma and flavour of malt, spice, fruit, caramel and hops.
"
1," Cask@GBBF2009. Deep ambery orange colour with small head. Aroma is hops, quite nig on caramel malts and also some bready notes. Flavour is wood, some not-too-sweet syrup as well as mild sweet malty notes.
"
1," JAN 31, 2006 The nose is salty, lemony, and pilsner-esque, but with a slight altbier tinge.  This one pours a brown amber that is unfiltered with a nice white head.  The mouthfeel is dominated by a thick carbonation upfront that thins out into a medium finish.  The first taste is banana-pepper and perhaps yeast followed by a ""juicy fruit""/fig middle and a medium, dry, and bitter finish.
"
1," OCT 8, 2007 The color was a hazy red/orange.  The head was fizzy and white.  The aroma was raisin and sweet with some citrisy notes.  The flavor was not as complex as I had expected.  There was a very slight sour/yeasty element as well as alcohol, raisin, and an aged taste.  The palate was carbonated and the finish light and a little waxy.
"
1," Dark clear amber, beautiful foam and lacing, good hoppy aroma and a complete and well-balanced bitter. Ive been looking for interesting variation in the usual West Coast micros and this one may not provide it, but it surprised me by having detail in aroma and bitterness that others just dont have.
"
1," 750ml Bottle. Hazy Brown, thin tany head. Yest, fruit, bubblegum, caramel and malt - typical Belgian flavours. Fairly dry and not much carbonation. Nice brew.
"
1," Tap at the brewery. Pours a dark clear brown, sizeable beige head. Aroma is light roasted malts. Taste is quite roasty, finishes with a touch of chocolate, bitter hops. Not bad for a middle of nowhere brewery.
"
1," Another fine beer gift from Steve-O, Beer Magician Extraordinaire.  Poured from 12 oz bottle, a little hazy, medium amber.  Forms nice head of foam, aroma of hops, malts and flowers.  Flavour of a malty character, with a accented hop lingering.  Reminds me of an English type IPA, perhaps a bit more hopped up, clean and refreshing beer.  Drinkable and sessionable brew.
"
1," ANother good beer of Chimay. Nice classic dubbel. Rocky white head.  Good brown color. Nice beer.
"
1," bottle. pours a dark ruby color with a thin orange head. lots of sediment floating around even though I took care not to disturb it. smells of fruit, mainly apple, cherry, and raisin, also hints of coriander and smoke. fruity and slightly bitter this beer is nearly a sensory overload. delicious but not really the type of beer that you can drink more than one of at a time.
"
1," Deep clear red with A moderate beige head. Aroma of pine, citrus, and caramel. Nice malt profile with a nice bitterness. Medium bodied with average carbonation. The best beer available at the Disney world location when we went.
"
1," (12oz bottle) Medium white head, clear straw body.  Aroma is medium sweet, grass, some skunk, apple.  Taste is medium sweet, bread, some caramel, light apple, grass.  Light body.
"
1," Poured a cloudy golden color with nice white head that lasted a while. Aroma is yeasty and is also fruity. Flavor is crisp, clean and fruity with a touch of bitterness. The mouthfeel is very nice and this beer disguises the 8% alcohol very well. Nice beer to sip and savor.
"
1," Bottle . A cloudy dark brown color pour with a thin tan head , spotty lacing , highly carbonated. Aroma of sweet malt , Belgian yeast , bread, rasins,lightly flopral and a hint of apple. Flavor is slightly bitter, nice sweet caramel taste, dark fruit , bread and a hint of spice. The high ABV is pretty well hidden and with the tiny carbonation bubbles helping to give a dry finish, well balanced , Full body with a smooth mouthfeel. Very drinkable , and quite enjoyable all around.
"
1," Bottle.  Woody bourbon and chocolate caramel aroma.  Dark brown color with small head.  Chocolate malt, coffee, and ash/dry grass flavor - a hint of bourbon in the finish.  Nice beer - a bit light.
"
1," I tried the Blue first and expected this to be a somewhat lesser version of tat.  The Red is a completely different beer, and a good one.  Very nice sweet aroma, and nice lively carbonation.  I actually like this a little more than the Blue.
"
1," Bottle. Extremely sweet caramel and malt aroma. Medium Amber with a thin head. Flavour is sweet syrup, you can almost feel the sugar on the lips. Finish is herb and bitter.
"
1," (Draught)  Pours a brown body with a moderate off-white head.  Aroma of cola, nuts, toasted malt, and caramel.  Flavor of chocolate, nuts, and mild hops.
"
1," Rich chocolate brown, hazy, with a thin tan head. Aromas of raisin bread, clay, cocoa, and something vaguely banana. Richly complex palate incorporating all of these elements, sweet, with a moderately heavy alcohol presence. Worthwhile as a treat, but I not a diehard fan of the belgian strong ales as a regular beverage-of-choice. It would be like having a huge piece of chocolate ganache for desert every single night-- waaayyy too rich and heavy, and as such, in danger of losing its appeal. Still, I admire the craftsmanship, and do enjoy them as a change of pace.
"
1," My serving of this was not all that great, if I can get this served in the propper way and under some better conditions then I will definately re rate this thing. Darker in colour with a big white long lasting head. The nose is mostly wheat and just a dab of malts which gives it a faint fruit presence. The tasete is bitter with some sourness to it. We had this at room temerature as well, dont think that this helped it too much. Different particurally from the white in that there is a nice kick of spice that is just sharp, Nutmeg? maybe?
"
1," AUG 18, 2003 Brown color, frothy head.  Spicy aroma.  Lingering, semi-bitter aftertaste.  A very nice beer and a definite must-have.  Much better after I had a few other Belgians under my belt and could notice and appreciat the complexities.
"
1," Aroma of alcohol, coffee and dark chocolate. Dark as night, small toffee head. Tastes of pitfruits, bitter and medium bodied. A fine and interesting treat! Thanks to qdog.
"
1," Pours dark brown with off white head. Aroma has nice fruit and sweetness. Flavor hasthe fruit but also a bitterness in the finish.
"
1," Pours a nice dark amber brown color with a solid head. Aroma of yeast and spice was excellent. Flavor was very complex, but never alcoholic. Toffee/roast malt  flavors were subtle with  yeast flavors playing the primary role. My favorite chimay.
"
1," lovely dark trappiste ale.. rich malty, oak taste with other subtle undertones...very nice beer indeed, altho i prefer chimay red over the blue or white.
"
1," FEB 25, 2011 Pours a dark brown color with a lasting white head. Aroma is malty with some floral notes. Tastes of roasted malts with nice dark fruit undertones. The finish is rather mellow and smooth. A good trappist, but not the best.
"
1," one of my favourites, the bottle I have was from 2006 (not sure on ideal length to age it, anyone?)  Regardles is a great beer, nice light fruity aroma.  MAlts give a nice sweetness(but not overly so)  to go along with caramel and slight spiciness.Carbonation is low (almost like a cask)  Very easy dirinking and very tasty
"
1," JUN 15, 2007 THe bottle was terrible with the cask barly better, amber colour, with funny aroma, clacwing malt.		Edinburgh beer festical 2007 ... CASK tk2 ... light ruby brown ... sweet malt nose ... sweet malt fruit... nothing special but drinkable. 1.1 > 3
"
1," This beer had a fairly dark body with descent head.  The high alcohol content was very well covered up and I recommend this beer to everyone.
"
1," On tap at Big River Grille, Nashville.  Pours chestnut brown in colour, decent head, nice lacing.  Nice floral hop aroma, and well balanced flavour, maybe a bit on the sweet malt side.  Enjoyable.
"
1," APR 6, 2006 100% blind rating.		Head is initially large, frothy, light brown, mostly lasting.		Body is hazy dark amber, bottle conditioned.		Aroma is lightly malty (bread, nuts), moderately yeasty (mold, wet cement), with light notes of raisin and clove.		Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter.	Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter.		Medium body, watery/velvety texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic.		Virtually identical rating as when last done non-blind, pretty much sums it up.
"
1," DEC 19, 2003 Better than your typical light lager. Decent head with a golden appearance. Flavor is smooth with no hops present and some malt. No reason to go after this considering the other quality beers this brewery offers. A good light summer beer. Head of the class in a class full of students on the small bus.
"
1," The first ""strong"" beer I liked. Dark brown, served in it's own special glass. Classy. I nice fruity taste and a wonderful aroma.
"
1," Dezent malziger Antrunk, der bereits trockene Akzente aufweist. Dazu eher wssrig hopfig. Zum mittelteil wird das Malz intensiver und breiter, den Hintergrund kann es aber nicht erobern, hier herrscht die Wssrigkeit. Karamellig, behindert durch die nun strkeren trockenen Teilen, wenig herb, insgesamt sffig. Ausgewogenes Mrzen mit angenehmen Rstnoten vor allem zum Ende. 6/8/9/9/6/8
"
1," Amber in color with a light hoppy aroma. Fairly balanced malt/hops, not much of anything happening here though.
"
1," Props to TAR for this one!!!!   Short lived white head w/ a ghostly light golden body.  Big time coriander nose w/ some wheat malt and peppery yeast.  hints of orange citrus. Very appealing!   Well balanced, spicy coriander & orangy citrus up front, but finishes a little dry & bitter in the aftertaste.  Cream of wheat flavored malt in between.  No tartness or crispness in a true Belg. Wit.  Medium carb., dryer m/f, lighter body but not watery.  Not a bad Wit, but not a classic either.  Very quaffable & has lots of flavor, but missing a few key elements to be a true classic.
"
1," Birra dal colore rosso mogano con una schiuma compatta e persistente.Al naso si percepiscono frutti di bosco e spezie.Al palato si presenta con dolce di malto.Il finale  lungo con le note amare del luppolo ben bilanciate.
"
1," This is what a Belgian beer tastes like. Pretty standard in all respects. What more can be said?
"
1," OCT 16, 2006 great beer,texture and a smooth and very unique taste.Love the trappist beers!
"
1," Bottled. Golden colour with a white head. Light malty and fruity aroma. Weak malt and fruity flavour
"
1," It poured out brown and had wonderful fruit tones, a high level of carbonation and a great balance between malts and hops. I didnt really notice the alcohol in the flavor. Its there alright!
"
1," Bottled, 0.33ltr. (vintage 2003) Dark brown beer with lots of yeast floating around, and a small, dense beige head. Looks delicious. Aroma is lightly roasted malt, with caramel, dried fruit and a little spicyness. When tasted, youre first stuck by a fizzy mouthfeel, then the flavors of caramel, roasted malt and a little alcohol. There is some spicyness too. The finish leaves you with a balanced bitterness, and a light stickyness in the mouth, due to the sweetness of the beer. This is absolutely a beer to enjoy in the evening, much better than a night cap or a cognac, as it leaves you relaxex, comforted and pleased. I was enjoying it so much that I almost forgot to rate it before I hit the ""Add Rating""-button. The colour, ABV and all the other aspects of this beer would make it an appopriate beer for the Christmas dinner, maybe I should try that this year. It has to be a 0.75ltr bottle then. (060202)
"
1," 33cl bottle from Systembolaget.	Grey/brown/plum with a yellowish head. 	Lots of fruit and belgian yeast in the aroma. 	Sweet smooth mouthfeel. I get the impression of a distorted kind of macro brew.
"
1," Pours a deep brown. Dark fruit, sweet malt, molasses, brown sugar , booze nose. Flavor is a rich malt, booze, vanilla, fig. Pretty viscous mouthfeel. Enjoyable beer.
"
1," Sampled at the Fall Crawl 2006 (our camping trip). Pours a deep amber with a huge lasting head. Good carbonation and sticky lacing. Flavor and aroma were of spicy malts and yeast with a well hidden alcohol punch. Another Belgian winner.
"
1," Had this beer at the All Colorado Beer Fest on 11/10/2007.  Aroma is light with with just a hint of malt.  Color is an brownish gold with good carbonation and a thick fairly tight head.  Taste is mild all the way around with light malt flavor and very light hop flavor.  Its just not as bold as I feel a Mrzen should be.
"
1," bottle thanks to blutt59.   murky brown with a beige head.  nose is wheat and circus peanuts.   not bad on the palate with a heavy flavor of circus peanuts.
"
1," 4/28/10.  12oz bottle into a pint.  Super cloudy orange pour with a 1.5-finger white head that fades fast.  The aroma and flavor is yummy citrus and tropical fruit, but it is either a bit watery or fading.
"
1," 75cl bottle from Willow Bend Liquors (Tampa, FL). Pours a dark golden/orangish/honey color with a thick frothy white head that slowly settles to about one finger. Good head retention. Aroma is ripe fruit, apple, spice, yeast, bread and complex aged cheese. Flavor is yeasty and fruity with notes of bread, honey, and hops. Light to medium body with a slightly bitter finish.
"
1," Bottle 37,5 cl. Courtesy of yespr. Pours a clear golden. Intense yet fresh apple and vanilla accents. Very intense body, sophisticated and sweet apple with an almost perfumy touch. Again vanilla accents. Lovely alcohol in the finish. Wonderful - as most ice ciders. 110110
"
1," Cask (gravity dispense) at Battersea Beer Festival 2006. A bronzed copper coloured beer. Difficult to categorise. Certainly not a ""Stout, Porter or Old Ale"", which the festival programme suggested. Toffee malt aroma. Fruity with a slight vinous tang. Sweetish, becoming a bit sickly. Alcohol is not very apparent. lacks clout for a big beer. Full marks for trying though.
"
1," Bottle.  Fruity orange-banana aroma with a hint of clove.  Clear orange-yellow color with small head.  An orange-banana blast of flavor with slight hops finish.  A nice tasting summer beer.
"
1," 12 oz. bottle via trade with decaturstevo - Pours a clear amber color with a 1/2 finger thick off white head.  Faint lacing.  Aroma is a bready, toasted malt.  Flavor is biscuit malt and light spice.  This beer is very Fat Tire like and thats a good thing.  Medium body.  A pretty good beer.  Thanks Steve.
"
1," Courtesy of Pailhead. Black with huge tan head. Way too carbonated. Bottle was borderline gusher. Aroma and flavor for the most part is all bourbon through and through. Flavor has hints of smoke and coffee grinds in the finish. Way overdone.

"
1," Draught at the brauhausVery nice arom aof noble hops, and some crispy malt too. The mouthfeel is dry initially, then the malt brings some light sweetness; the malt flavor is moderate but of fairly good quality; quite strong bitterness but not much hop character. Solid, pleasant and fresh.
"
1," Pours a dark dark brown colour with a thin white head. The aroma is stong mint and light malts. The taste is very light chocolate with a strong mint aftertaste and light on the palate.
"
1," bottle-thanks to vyvvy for giving me this one.  pours cloudy yellow with a sudsy white head-thick and smooth.  nose is a bit lemony with undertones of pale grains (wheat).  A bit on the egg notes as well-sulfer.  flavors are more in the american wheat character with tons of lemon and grainy notes.  lite body and mild carbonation, at least on the mouth.  long lemony finish.  pretty decent wit!

1," Hazy orange with a large off white head. Sweet yeasty aroma with wheat and banana notes. Sweet yeasty flavour with wheat and bananas. Finished sweet and yeasty.
"
1," 330 mL bottle from LCBO, served in a branded Trappist glass. Pours a murky mahogany with  a tall tan head. Great retention and good lace. Aromas of yeast and flowers with some fruit. As it warms, the aroma becomes more alcoholic. Flavour is quite yeasty with floral notes from the hops. A malty sweetness develops through the middle, accompanied by notes of candied fruit, brandy and grapes. The finish is long and malty. On the palate, this beer is moderately astringent, medium-full in body with a smooth texture. Overall, an excellent brew. Complex and subtle, its the ideal accompaniment to an evening of philosophical meandering. Considerably less malty than Chimay Rouge, but notably more aromatic and alcoholic. 2010-03-20
"
1," FEB 4, 2007 Beer 16 and the final brew of the night at  Obriens Trappist Tasting 2/3/07.   From a 2005 dated magnum.  Pours dark brown with almost no light penetrating.  No head, and a very light aroma, sweet strong taste.  Its a good beer but really not very memorable in comparison to other trappists.
"
1, Red brown. Long lasting head. Smell
1," Bottled. Deep golden coloured. Malty aroma. Malty and slightly hoppy flavour. Light bitterness in the finish. Soft and bready.
"
1," The color turned me off.  A murky brown pour that looked like blended muddy water.  Aroma and taste are ok though.  Heavy with a sweet malt on both nose and mouth.
"
1," 11.2oz bottle in a Trappist glass.  Pours opaque brown with a lingering, thick beige head.  Aroma of spicy yeast, brown sugar, caramel malts, and light hops.  Flavor mainly from the yeast and malts, but there is a hoppiness at the end.  Silky texture.  A pretty good beer.
"
1," Of the Chimays I have tasted this was good, a decent brew but kinda in the middle of the pack so to speak for Chimay.  this had a sweet herbal nose with a cloudy amber appearance.   Definitely a dried fruit flavor with some herbal notes mixed in.
"
1, Strong yeast smell with a hint of fruity	-Appearance
1," 375 ml (?) bottle shared with Capflu, Goldorak, beerbuzzmontreal,  Boutip and DumDum at the Ciderwinder tasting in Ottawa.  Still light amber, no legs, appears a bit thin...honey hints in the medium-sweet fresh apple nose...bit of sharpness and spice as it warms...average sweet-tart balanced body...not much to say here, really.
"
1," JAN 17, 2003 Rich, chocolate nose and taste.  Not quite as heavy as I would have expected.  A very good seasonal.  This was in the  Chattanooga branch.  May be the same as the Winter""s Nip.
"
1," (bottle, purchased at the brewery) Clear, pale golden colour with a medium-sized foamy white head. Slightly draffy pale malty aroma with citric and slightly herbal hops. Bitter-sweet flavour, light to medium bodied with a pleasantly carbonated mouthfeel. Pale malty base with notes of draff and a whiff of fruity and herbal spicy aroma hops; moderately dry and malty, slightly hop bitter finish with a good bitterness-sweetness ratio. Well done. 08.V.10
"
1," 300ml vom Fass. Ohne filter. Slightly hazy, golden body colour under a fragile white head, mostly lasting. Grass and hay smell. The flavour contains hints of lemon and orange. Moderate sweetness. Quite refreshing. Foamy mouthfeel (WestParkBru, Ingolstadt 22.06.2007).
"
1," 25.4 oz bottle.  Pours a clear brown with a good head.  Somewhat lighter taste than other trappists, but malty and fruity, it is brewed with water from the brewing monestary which gives this beer a pleasently interesting flavor.  Reccomended.
"
1," Hazy brown pour with a white head and nice lacing on the glass.  Pretty weak in terms of aroma.  Some grain and yeast with the slightest hint of fruit.  Smooth bitter malt flavor with some yeast and alcohol on the finish.  Nothing too special.
"
1," I was pleasantly surprised by this.  Pours a murky, dark orange color with a small white head.  Decent lacing.  Floral and piney hops at the forefront of the aroma along with some citrus and malt undertones.  Thin, dry citrus on the initial taste with a big infusion of the hoppy bitterness following.  As this warmed the hops dominated but not in a bad way.  Has a bit of a tart finish.  Good brew.
"
1," Nice presentation, good lacing, clarity and color. A mentionable amount of skunk and more bitter than youd expect. This tastes like a well-crafted typical West Coast recipe.
"
1," Draft at brewery. Deep glowing orange with big head. Cheesy, off aroma is similar but also different from the weizenbock. I almost smell ammonia but then again, it really just smells rustic more than anything else and manages to remain ok. Sweet finish with not a lot of banana esters. Has a nice cereal grain entry and a correspondingly granular body. Finishes light, and dry with a hint of malty sweetness but isnt sticky or yeasty or even very fruity. Odd as its sister beer!
"
1," An all-time great beer. Slightly sweet, but with real beer flavor. One of my top five beers of all time.
"
1," See the other few thousand positive comments! I cant believe how great a finish this beer has. Picked it up in Gubei Carrefour, Shanghai.
"
1," I think that this is great from start to finish.  Wonderful aroma, great color, amazing smooth taste.  Each sip you take seems to get better then the first.  This is one incredible beer!!!
"
1," Bottle looks simple, but good, the beer in the glass not very zippy, small head. Starts mild, a bit moldy-grasy, malty-sweet. Soft-hoppy background. Well balanced finish, spicy-grasy, very fresh. Quite drinkable. Good beer!
"
1," Amber body with an orangey hop nose.  Head is really creamy. Flavour is thin but lasts.  A nice light beer that can be an easy drinker.
"
1," Very nice dark ale.  has a noticable taste of alcohol, but still a nice finish.  Only thing is it is extremely expensive, bout $85 for a case
"
1," Bottle 50 cl. Courtesy of fonefan. Pours a clear yellow with a white head. Sweet and clean malty nose - very German. Medium body, sweet clean malts with some sulphur. Very subdued hops. 290111
"
1," Bottle from strykzone.  Thanks Dave.  Almost a black pour with a very small brown head.  Aroma is dark chocolate, molasses and maybe the faintest hints of bourbon.  Flavor is pretty roasty with notes of chocolate and a tiny hint of sourness. My only question is how long did they age this in bourbon barrels, 1 hour or 2 hours.  The bourbon flavor is so light and so faint you would never notice it if you didnt know what you were drinking. Still its a pretty good stout.
"
1," Oh man was I looking forward to this.  Ive been stuck in Japan, the beer black hole, and this is the first good beer Ive been able to drink in too long of a time.  Poured an opaque brown with oat-colored rocky head.  Taste was deeply malty, surprisingly not very sweet, with good warming alcohol.  Not quite as full boadied as I expected for a Belgian, with lots of carbonation, and almost resembled a bock.  Nevertheless, quite enjoyable.  Not the best Ive had, but certainly better than what I have easy access to.
"
1," MAY 22, 2005 Im really not sure how I feel about rating it for I will tie Emily (ChimayBabe) in overall ratings and do it while drinking Chimay Red. I know she would understand. Now the day I equal Aaron, Jeff, or Eric will be cause for celebration. This is one of the beers that created the beergeek I am today, 15 years later and it is still one of my first loves and something I drink 3 or 4 times a year. Anyway, on to the rate"
1," NOV 18, 2006 Bottle.		Pours a deep caramel brown with just a bit of fine sediment and a full if low-density head. The aroma is just marvellous - bready and spicy yeast, long caramel notes,  a hint of lemon. The flavor is very subtly sweet, slight cola notes, a hint of spice, a reasonable twist of hops into the finish, overall just a very balanced dubbel. The mouthfeel is on-target, amply carbonated, no alcohol burn.
"
1," Bottle. Poured a clear copper color with an off white head. Smelled of date, clove, subdued flowery hop, anise, and cereal grain. There was also a whiff of mint. Light to medium bodied and dry. I tasted mixed spices, light pine, anise, and a bit of oak.
"
1," Dark mahogany, no head or lacing. Nose is light with blood, sherry and engine grade oil. Old and oxidized. Why an 8 for aroma? I really liked the layered combination of those smells for some reason. The flavor is sweet and fruity, nice but a bit old. Finishes sweet like sweet-n-low but with a little cardboard in there for good measure.
"
1," Tap at San Diego brewery. Not as good as Duvel in my opinion. Flavors were mostly alcohol and some yeast.
"
1," Poured a reddish brown with a medium thin, light tan head. The aroma had spicy notes, with the yeasty/earthy/sour Belgian smell, and some citrus notes. The flavor was big up front yeast taste, some citrus/spice taste, a little thin and lacking complexity. The palate was a little thin, yet lively with carbonation. The finish was warming from alcohol.
"
1," Another great Belgian beer. Aroma was sweet and fruity, and appearance was a rich cloudy brown. The flavor was of  yeast, malt, spice, sweet fruit and barely noticeable alcohol. Medium-bodied, the palate complemented the flavor well. Very enjoyable.
"
1," After trying more belgians over the few months, they are definitely evolving into my favorite style.  The Chimay is an excellent representative and hits all the typical trappist notes, which a the flowery nose, sweet flavoring, complex character, and pleasant finish.  Good stuff.
"
1," From my notes, February 06. 330ml bottle. Dark reddish brown color with a thick head that lasted through the whole drinking experience. Spicy aroma with hints of yeast and malt. Light alcohol presence, taste of dough and dried fruit. Malty and yeasty undertones. Better than Chimay White IMO, but no match for Blue.
"
1," SEP 1, 2005 Sam and I tried this one blind amongst other strong Belgian ales. Could drink just the one. Aroma of cherries that leads into the taste as well. Theres also pepper - odd. Spice makes it feel stronger. Sam"
1," Great flavor.  Malty, fruity and rich but the alcohol flavor is quite noticeble.
"
1," (On tap) Nashville. Clear, pale amber with a creamy, off-white head. Fresh, lightly citrusy aroma from the Cascade hops. Medium body with a vague hint of caramel. Distinct, hoppy finish. 290306
"
1," A very mild example of a belgin tripple. Sweet with hint of fig. Really all about the yeast.
"
1," Bottle. [Tasting session @ Papsoe] Huge thick light beige head that really lasted. Excellent display of lacework. Light cloudy mahogany color. Aroma of light toasted malt, grain, yeast, fruit. Over the palate came strong notes of toasted malt, light rue bread, mild alcohol, grain, caramel. Medium bodied with an average carbonation and light alcoholic texture. Moderated sweet flavour. Sweet toasted malty finish.
"
1," Draught in Chattanooga location.  This one pours a crystal clear golden color.  there was a small white head on mine.  The aroma is milder, with some grass and floral notes.  It is a lighter body beer.  Its taste is somewhat dry, and a touch biter.  Nothing impressive about it, but nothing bad either.
"
1," Dirty red-brown beer with a nice off white head. Aroma is malty and light fruity. It has a good nutty caracter and a maltyness. Taste is very refreshing for this style. It has a nice earthy touch, a fine fruityness and a great nutty feeling. In the finish there is a subtile bitterness..
"
1," Pours a clear, reddish-amber body with a small, off-white head.		Smell"
1," Growler from brewpub. Pours is a clear red. These guys make some solid beers assuming they are not infected. Toasted grain aroma a little more on the wheat side. Caramel malt aromas as well. Clean and clear flavors up front with a bitter and dry finish. Nice grassy hop finish with some citrus peel that lasts for a while.
"
1," I have long heard about Chimay, I guess there was so much momentum put into this ale and so much positive talk that I expected this mind blowing, earth Shattering, divine and sarced momentous experience the likes no man has ever experienced before...I was sorely disapointed. I would say that this was alright but nothing great. Smooth, bitter, rich it is nice, just not that nice.
"
1," [3200-20100731] Cask. Sweet apples aroma. Clear, pale yellow body with no head. Rich apple flavour is sweet throughout with a light driftwood finish. Medium body. Quite pleasant.	(@ Middle Farm, Lewes, England)
"
1," From a 33cl bottle.		Hmm, my first trappist and Im a bit underwhelmed.  Maybe my palate isnt as experienced or sophisticated, seeing as how Im 22, but this beer is a bit overrated in my opinion.  Very yeasty smell, but a good one, and probably the best feature of this beer.  Fizzy as all get out, like a champagne, the mouthfeel is medium with a warm, numbing alcohol sensation.  The flavor is caramelly sweet with a spicy background which becomes stronger as you swallow it.  A spicy, almost peppery aftertaste follows.  Not bad, but not something I would try again.
"
1," I cant believe Ive been on Rate Beer this long and havent rated this beer.  Admittedly my least favorite of the Chimay beers, still a nice Dubbel.  Sampled out of one of the little bottles.  Murky brown color with a big rocky beige head.  Light pit fruit nose with some dark sugar.  Warming alcohol sensation.  Tastes of ripe plum and other juicey fruits, and dark brown sugar sweetness.  Solid beer, and readily available.
"
1," Pours a dark chocolate brown with amber notes abd frothy off-white head.  Spicy-sweet aroma with a bit of an alcohol kick.  Incredibly smooth and sweet balanced with nutty maltiness.  Money in the bank.
"
1," Cask Handpump at the Borough Arms, Crewe 14/07/2005	Copper amber coloured with a fruit aroma. Some wheat flavour in a slightly bitter dry lasting malt finish.
"
1," Very sweet and floral.  Smooth, despite its strength.  Pretty well balanced, but it doesnt stand out against some other Belgians Ive had, even if they arent my favorite style.
"
1," This set the standard for me for a long time. Now its an old standby that never lets me down. Even gave one to a neighbor whos a Pacifico drinker and he loved it.
"
1," Bottle. Pours a cloudy dark reddish amber with a large, white thick head. Aroma is a lot of Belgian yeast with tones of banana and cloves and spiciness, some candy sugar. Taste is strongly clovey, with some pepper and Belgian yeast. Palate is alright, not as strong as it should be.
"
1," Premire impression peu convaincante mais qui prend de lassurance au fur et  mesure quelle se rchauffe. Un peu de tannin comme le vin avec un fini mtallique. Lamertume semble provenir de houblons gnriques. Bonne ide mais manque de finition. Une porter?
"
1," Unfiltered dark ruby pour with medium head. Pleasant aroma of yeast, floral and mild sweetness. Taste is of strong spice with some notes of raisins. Finishes only noticeably bitter with a light alcohol note. Although not thick, it has a way of almost numbing your mouth for a second. Very unique in that way.
"
1," 8th Big Beers, Belgians, and Barleywines.  Pours clear amber with a spare, rocky, white head, diminishing with spare lacing.  Aroma is heavy malt (cookie, caramel, nutty), average hops (flowers, grass), average yeast (earth) with notes of dates, apples, and pears.  Medium bodied, oily texture, soft carbonation, and a metallic finish.  Average duration, moderate sweetness,  light acidity and bitterness.
"
1," deep golden, small head; light sweetish-grainy nose with a very delicate herbal touch; light to moderate bitter-sweet flavour; a light tinge of hops in the grainy finish. A bit boring......
"
1," Redbrown and a nice head.	light taste of strawberries and bananas and nearly perfectly balanced.
"
1," These monks make the most of the one vice allowed.  A beer with complex wine-like qualities.  Hints of various fruits come through as it warms.  Try it with Havarti or another soft cheese.  Outstanding beer.
"
1," Aroma begins with mild noble hops and finishes with grapes, reminiscent of Pinot Noir, heavy fruit.  Pours a woody brown with copper highlights.  The off white head laces fairly.  Flavor is big fruit with early bitterness and the trifecta is completed with  complex malt.  Surprisingly light-bodied and the finish is very dry.  Overall, as complex and fruity as a dry wine, yet the malt and hops add more than you can get from wine alone.  The alcohol sneaks up on you and I keep wanting to soothe my dry tongue, a deadly combination.
"
1," Poured from a small bottle; has a deep red-brown color and a thin head. Smells of bread and malts with a hint of fruit. Taste definitely has some alcohol in it as well as some dark fruit, giving it a nice semi-sweet taste with a slight kick, definitely something to keep in the mouth to savor.
"
1," On tap at Hamilton Place. The body was deep gold with an off white head. The aroma was earthy and light with some grapefruit. There was also some fresh cut wood. The taste was grapefruit with some bread crust. Decent.
"
1," Pours coppery golden with an off white head. Aroma is citrusy hops and a little malt. Flavor is piney hop, sweet caramel malt, and a little fruity citrus.
"
1," Better than the red... much better.  The aroma seems a little weaker, but great character...  Flavors of yeast, burnt orange, and wine.  And speaking of wine, has about the same alcoholic ""bite"" of a pinot, etc.  Great beer.
"
1," No nose.	Amber, creamy lacing head.	Light roasted, honey heather fruity malt. 	Honey finish.	Ok
"
1," a bit too light for my taste.
"
1," Out of the Blue, Red, and White, this one is least impressive.  Even though, it still features complex and smooth palate.  Amber unfiltered color with mild fruity aroma succumbs to well disguised alcohol bliss.  Well Played!
"
1," Although not quite as heavy as its cousins, Chimay Blanche and Bleu, the Rouge is a very tasty abbey dubbel. Like most dubbels, its malty and full-bodied, but unlike most of them it has a particularly yeasty flavor. Taste is of brown sugar, as brown as the brew itself when it hits the glass. A moderate, off-white topping gives of a faint scent of clove. This is a very nice beer; light enough to go with most foods or to be drunk rather easily, beefy enough to weigh in with the pros.
"
1," Pours dark brown with a slight deep red color. Has a good head that stays. The taste is complex; first you notice slightly bitter hop and warm alcohol. Then the much stronger sweet fruit and roasted malt flavors kicks in. The beers body, head, and aroma are great, and the taste is well balanced. Great brew.
"
1," Different brews can vary wildly in style. From deep brown and tart to light and Wit-like. Very much an acquired taste and generally not appreciated by anyone except the islanders themselves. I have a story Id like to share. Back in the days of the cold war I was doing military service on the island. On new years eve about 20 or so of us had to stay while all the others went to celebrate with friends and family. Somehow one of the locals managed to conjure up about 40 liters of ""dricke"". We made a campfire on the beach looking out over a wintery Baltic sea and had one hell of a party. The evening ended with everyone not from the island (except me) being very sick. That is dricke for you, dangerous stuff! 
"
1," Pours a murky golden color with a small fizzy off white head.  Small Particles. Aroma of spicy bready malts.  Intitial spicy flavor with a sour finish.  Watery texture.  Pretty good beer overall but the Rochefort 8 and Westmalle Dubbel are way better.
"
1," Poured a nice orange/copper color with nice head and lacing.  Aromas were average, really had to sniff hard to get all of them.  Tasted pretty well balanced, with a nice malt profile mixed with a decent hop presence.  The intensity wasnt really there, as it lacked the punch I like.  It was drinkable.
"
1," JUN 26, 2004 Chimaaaaaaaay! Had quite a bit of floating crap while inside the bottle. Coppery with a big foamy head. Has kind of a metallic smell to it. Has some sort of spicey yeast smell I cant put my finger on. Does kind of have the skin of the apricot smell. Has a smooth dry nutty metallic taste. If this is what monks do then I am in the wrong business.
"
1," A really good beer as I can drink more of, have a lovely aroma and is slightly cloudy orange in it.
"
1, 7/6/2006 Total Score
1," Mint, vanilla, caramel and chocolate in the aroma.  Opaque and murky tan-brown body is topped by a dense, fine bubbled white head that lasts well and coats the glass as it descends.  Nutty flavour is strong and the hops shine through nicely.  Oak is subdued and offers a pleasant counterpoint.  Medium body with creamy smooth carbonation and very soft, quiet but lasting carbonation that works really well.  A very well-crafted beer although, Im still not entirely sure its my thing...  Sampled on cask at Dix (Caskival 2007).
"
1," FEB 17, 2011 bottiglia 33clcolore tonaca di frate con schiuma caramello fina e abbastanza lunga!profumi di prugna uva vino e anche un po di malto tostato!buona frizzantezza buon corpo e un piacevolissimo retrogusto di prugne e di noci!forse un pizzico troppo astringente!ci saranno anche delle polemiche su questa birra ma per me rimane un piacere berla ,non stanca mai e facile da trovare
"
1," MAR 4, 2011 Bottle. Malty, brown sugar, yeasty aroma. Dark brown colour, slightly cloudy. Big semi-stable head. Peppery and brown sugar flavour. Alcoholic, very dry aftertaste. Good mouthfeel, as if there is rye in there and with pleasant carbonation.
"
1," 330 ml bottle. Slightly cloudy golden color, very big head. Bright aroma of citric hops. The taste is extremely smooth, with great undertones of hops and fruit. Very drinkable and quite appealing, Chimay cant seem to go wrong.
"
1," No head over pale copper-coloured beer. Hayish, slighlty sourish nose, as hay or grain gone wet. Bit of thin caramel and toaste. Caramel more prominent in the mouth; acidity seems to play ""now you see, now you dont"". Sweet malty grains, biscuit. Flat as a pancake. I wonder about lightstruck, but no cats pee smells. Something wrong with this bottle, I presume, pity.  Txs to Honza! 
"
1," Pours a reddish amber, white foamy head.	Spicy aroma, coriander, black pepper, wild cheesy yeast aroma.	Crisp sweetness.	Full bodied, oily, lively carbonation, long chewy finish.
"
1," (12oz bottle thanks to Cavie) clearish orange-brown with very few bubbles. Nose is herbal, floral, wildflowers, a bit weird. Taste of toasty grain, light caramel and spices. Very dry finish and a bit undercarbonated.
"
1," August 09. 2005, ""The Seaforth"" in Ullapool, Scotland, bottle, cold. Re-rated at home in Denmark later on. Its a black/brown beer with a moderate head. the aroma has weak notes of roasted malt and aroma hops. The flavour is thin as well, but I look hard, I do find discrete notes of licorice, caramel and coffee. The finish is slightly bitter. If it had had some more power and fuller body, it would have been a really nice beer.
"
1," a bit dusty, slightly sweet malty with a touch of citrus and slightly spicy (nettles) hops. Moderately bitter flavour, light to medium bodied with a crispy mouthfeel. Malty, slightly strawy taste with subtle fruity notes; Light-bitter finish with malt and herbal hops in good balance. Still a decent one.
"
1," Definitely a pleasant experience, not what one would expect from such a tiny, understated bottle.  Doesnt taste like any 9% beer.   NIce aroma, great muddy brown appearance and the flavour is a fine and sweet.
"
1," Deep, but not impenetrable brown and gives a voluminous creamy white head that leaves excellent lace and takes a white to settle. The aromas are of powdered chocolate, cinnamon, brioche and full, lush stonefruit. Those chocolate and baking flavours hit first and then dehydrated apricot in muesli. Also nutty almond and  brazil nuts dance on the palate of this creamy, sexy ale. The finish is one of dessert and pistachio. There is nothing not to like.
"
1," pour is a light orange color. Medium sized white head initially which subsides quickly. Aroma is lightly herbal. Flavor is herbal, albeit light with low carbonation. Mild bitterness in the finish. Nothing to write home about but easy to drink.
"
1," Transparent and cherry chocolate when put to light. A thin pin-dotted strain swirls around the head. Aroma heightens the anticipation, emitting black fudge brownies, unrefined mocha beans covered in dark chocolate, hints of Madagascar vanilla bean and baked mocha torte sauce. Flavor onsets with too much frits and feverishly dissipates across the palate. Astringent edges curtail around the outer realm while a charred, French roast coffee flavor gets hard pressed to the top of burnt brownies. Hallow in all areas, and at its best in the sweetened vanilla mocha finish. Stretched too far to make an impact. Thanks for bringing it, MrFacto!
"
1," On tap at BR in Chattanooga. Wow color me impressed! This beer poured a copper color with a white head. The aroma is full of lemons, grapefruit, pine, and oranges. The flavor is extremely bitter with some lemons, oranges, and grapefruit. The standard Big River IPA is rather malty but this is much more in the IPA mold. Overall this was very enjoyable!
"
1,"	Another one of the Chimay Cultus I have had many times in the past.	Recently re-drunk this one and after having some of the finest beers in the world, this one still taste damn good.	A nice ruby warm beer, which is maybe even better than all those so called herfst bock beers, yes, definitely better.	A glass of this beer with a good autumn/winter meal makes you enjoy life even more.	This brew still kicks ass!
"
1," Alcoholic smell, golden  colour, almost no head. Quite typical trippel which is not extremely interesting, but not bad either.
"
1," Simply amazing.  I drank this beer like water while in Brussels.  I brought home a 4 pack and some chimay glasses.  It is amazing there is 9% alcohol in this, as it has a very smooth malty flavor.  I could get by drinking only this for quite some time.
"
1," Fantastic. Poured a dark caramel color, with a malty yeasty aroma and a light fruit scent. Nice bite after the fact. Smooth. Highly drinkable. Excellent. Although, unlike most posters, I believe the Chimay Rouge edges it out a bit. Perhaps it's the lower alcohol content, but the rouge was more enjoyable to me.
"
1," Bottle at Austins Steakhouse. Pours a cloudy copper with medium off-white head. Aroma is predominantly raisin, yeast, and caramel. Theres a background of pepper and fruity esters. Flavor has a sweet malt backbone with a wonderful mix of spice and yeast. Some sharp hops bring out the bitterness but are softened by a raisin-caramel finish. This was great with my perfectly seared blue cheese burger.
"
1," Tasted 8/11/10. Sampler from the Brewpub. Hazy with a dark amber hue. Brainy and ring of off-white head. Woody and earthy aromatic notes. Undertones of vanilla. Medium bodied and somewhat unblended. The base altbier is nice but it is completely overwhelmed by the bourbon barrel flavor. Earthy and spicy flavors with the vanilla oakiness taking the front seat as far as flavor goes. Nice to try, but this was overpowering and overt.
"
1," Aromatic sweetness, hops, and a whif of pine. Pours a very dark brown, cloudy, lacing is quite nice. Mouthfeel is enjoyable, complex and robust. A balanced beer; alcohol is well hidden, fruity flavours come through, hops are present but not overpowering. A quality beer. Love that stubby inspired bottle.
"
1," Great beer. Pours dark brown, very large head. Lots of fresh yeast on the nose. tHe flavor is fantastic, good balance of yeast and spicyness. Not as strong as I was expecting, but very good.
"
1," AUG 1, 2008 Unclear golden beer with a thick, creamy head.  Lingering.	Herbal/citrus hops, slightly spicy yeasty aroma.  Cloves or nutmeg?	Crisp hops up front, some almost solventy hot alcohols. Lingering grassy herbal bitterness, balanced by light crystal sweetness.  Very dry, light-bodied.		Idiosyncratic. I like it.
"
1," 12oz bottle. Popped it open and its definitely a gusher...infected? Well see. Pours a very deep brown, mostly black colored body with a two finger-width, dense and foamy, light brown, gushing head that continues to grow until it slowly collapses and leaves lots of lacing. Aroma is a possibly infected sour dark fruitiness mixed in with a decent barrel-aged porter. Some caramel, roast, vanilla-bourbon, chocolate, and wood. Flavor seems less infected and is actually quite enjoyable despite the light sourness. Lots of roast, vanilla-bourbon, and wood up front with a moderate caramel and chocolate. Sour dark fruits, some coffee, and more wood before this finishes very dry with a moderate, roasty, woody bitterness along with a good amount of vanilla-bourbon, coffee, and dry cocoa. Just a slight sour dark fruitiness in a lengthy aftertaste. Medium body and fairly high, lively carbonation. Overall, I initially thought this was infected, but it may be what they were going for. The sourness has more of a negative effect on the aroma than the flavor. The flavor is actually pretty solid with lots of dry roasts, vanilla-bourbon, and cocoa, but I cant get past the thought that this is infected. Either way, infected or not, this was okay, but Id like to try it without the attached sourness...if thats possible.
"
1," Bottle. Wheaty, worty aroma. Banana and pineapple in the worty flavor. Pineapple. Very fruity and quite drinkable weizen.
"
1," Smells like an O Douls.  Decent head, light golden hue.  Sharp aftertast in the nose.
"
1," 33 CL Bottle.  One of the first times I've had the small bottle of this one.  While I enjoyed this one, the bigger bottle does tend to have more complexity.  This one was a bright deep copper color with a moderate off white head. Malty aroma with a touch of fruit and floral hops.  In the small bottle very clean and more refined.
"
1," Bottle, about two years old.  And a bit of a gusher.  Lost about a fifth of the bottle, but what was left poured a deep dark ruby brown with a thin to medium sized (I think it may have been medium sized at one point, I was wiping down my desk at the time so I may have missed that part) head.  Big spicy malt and old dark fruit.  Caramel and toffee, big and sweet, dark cherries and fruit leather.  Medium bodied, sweet and malty, much more subtlety than the nose would indicate.  Smooth and cool, even a bit empty in the middle.  Long slow finish with figs and touches of anise spice, and a gracefully developing little bit of warming alcohol.  Nice stuff.
"
1," MAR 17, 2011 Lovely. I hadnt had this in a couple years, and knocked back a couple bottles this evening at the Broad Street Cafe, Durham. Not quite as fruity and sticky as a lot of dubbels Ive sampled, this one is surprisingly lively and refreshing. Heavily carbonated, you still get a sense of the craft, with spices and some figs or matured apples coming through. Very fine.

1," Dark brown, nearly opaque, with a thin, tan head.  The aroma is pretty strong with nice coffee, sweet chocolate, caramel, burnt toast and a hint of light fruit.  The body is full, lightly oily and smooth with light carbonation and total tongue coating.  The flavor is pretty good, but the coffee comes across a little old.  Otherwise, the combination is good and the sweetness of the malt is balanced by the bitter coffee.  Its pretty good, but just a little short being top notch.
"
1," Growler from Alt Platz.  Murky brown settles to faint swirls and a tan ring of tiny bubbles.  Aroma is chocolate dipped banana covered in hot fudge.  Velvety coffee cocoa with a bright plummy tang.  Black grapes, hints of licorice.  Light drying with espresso. Excellent.
"
1," 1 year old stored in plastic bottle - Thanks a lot Per for bringing it to Denmark!!Pours hazy orange with no head. Lots of smoke, tar and ropes in the aroma with hints of sweet orange. Very odd and very extreme! Dry flavor with lots of smoke and fruit. Very weird and very interesting but a little too much in the long run. Still very fun to taste!
"
1,"  Deep brownish-ruby, clear for now, rocky off-white head.	  	Aroma"
1," Cloudy brown with a tan head that is course and disappears quickly.  Aroma is of refreshing yeast/apple, spiced bread, and a bit of cider.  Flavor is overwhelmingly apple-yeast-spice-alcohol up front, very refreshing.  This is then overtaken by a more bready, spicy flavor as the yeast subsides.  This is incredibly drinkable, and much more apple-yeast, and less harsh spiciness than I remember.  Tickling, fuzzy carbonation with a light body also makes this a nice break from the other big beers Ive been drinking lately, or the not-so-fine BDSAs Ive been attempting to brew lately.
"
1," Available at the firkin section of the Brewers of Indiana Guild Winterfest. Little cousin of Barrel Aged Count Hopula. The bourbon on this took a back seat to the brew, which I liked a lot. Aroma was Barfly with notes of vanilla and a hint of bourbon. Flavor was much the same, with a nice woodiness thrown in. Very smooth and drinkable, the hops and wood mixed very well together. Nice.
"
1," Large bottle bought at Whole Foods, cork says 04/07. Looks like cola! Aroma is malt, figs and dried fruits. Bitter up front with the taste of dried fruit and spice, followed by malt.  Very nice and unique brew.
"
1," Beer poured copper colored with a big white head that slowly sank into a film covering the top of the glass.  Aroma was fruity with some banana and arpicot, and some phenolic spice.  Flavor is matly with fruity yeast esters, and some spiciness.  palate is soft and full of small bubbles.  A nice brew.
"
1," 12oz. bottle.  Aroma is full of roasted coffee and chocolate malts, along with a touch of toffeeish sweetness and faint earthiness.  Largely opaque ebony color with a lasting, fine head.  Flavor contains a blend of bittersweet cocoa and gentle hop flavors up front, drying out a bit and seeing an influx of roasted, nearly burnt coffee that becomes stronger at the finish and brings a certain bittering, blackened grain quality.  Texture is fairly smooth and creamy, body is medium-full.  Nicely blended coffee stout.
"
1," JUL 28, 2007 July 2007. Hazy brown body with a moderate beige head (3+). Sweet aroma of malt, caramel,  and lightly scorched toffee, hints of brown sugar, and wisps of yeast and alcohol. (7+) Sweet caramel malt flavour is relatively simply with dry alcoholic undercurrent that lingers long in the aftertaste. Tangy malt bite in the finish (7+). Smooth but light medium palate (3+).  7+/3+/7+/3+/14-16 - 3.7	<P>Dec 2000. The first of the gift set... Nice foamy head. Taste the spices more as it warms. Hint of fruit, goes down deceptively easy. 7/4/7/15 - 3.7
"
1," Pours hazy with a dark amber color and copper highlights; head is off-white, full, and fizzy, but settles to an average, frothy, and somewhat lasting head with minimal lacing.  Nose is decent and somewhat subdued for the style but does carry a Chimay character; notes of yeast, prune, light brown sugar, some apricot maybe, and touch a a typical Chimay herb character.  Flavor is similar being sweet with a touch of bitterness carrying mild notes of herbs; brown sugar is dominant with some yeast, a light toastiness, date, and some faint apple note.  Palate is not quite medium, almost lively, and with a nice smooth feel, almost silky.  Finishes with some bitterness and an herbal note with short sweetness of brown sugar.  Fairly well put together dubbel and remarkably drinkable.  Nice to drink, but just not to the incredibly high expectations of the other Chimay brews; lacks the great complexites but does enjoy the smooth, drinkability of the white and especially the blue.
"
1," pours cloudy off-yellow white, quickly dissipated head, sliding lacing. Drank at 10C, very minor toasted flavour, almost non-existent coconut flavour. Somewhat sour aftertaste, with orange notes occupying the middle stanza. A little creamy, but somewhat disappointing thin body, hard rough bitter finish. Will not go another round.
"
1," Bottle @ Ulfborg Weekend, Jan 2011. Pours  clear pale yellow with a bubbly white head. Dry, grainy and bitter. A bit of vegetalbes and dust. Medium to thin body. Ok
"
1," MAR 20, 2009 bottle, pours dark brown with a tall off white head.  Extremely sweet full bodied beer with a rough bitterness that fails to balance all that sugar.  Good, but doesnt do it for me.
"
1," (bottle) Murky and hazy mahogany coloured effervescent hue with yeast floaties and a mid-sized brown head. Sweet dark malts aroma with fruits (plums, blackcurrants) and yeasts. Moderately sweet toasted malty taste with light notes of caramel, raisins and dried plums, medium to full bodied, crispy mouthfeel. Warming alcoholic, slightly vinous and spicy finish. Complex and harmonic brew.
"
1," Puncfhy citric aroma, but the flavour does not add much. A one sided hop showcase.
"
1," bubblegum and cherry candy. Wow! This beer is sweet in a way that it doesnt assault the taste buds. Its a mild fruity-sweet and not a harsh / sharp sugar-sweet. The taste is a complex combination of malts and fruits although I can make out bubblegum and Maraschino cherry in the aftertaste. Astringent but velvety fruity finish with a nice clean ending. Belgium, this has got to be one of your aces. Hey Bartender (brandishing my empty glass).
"
1," Bottled 750ml (BB 07/2011)	Thanks bierkoning for this spcial German.	Slightly amber color, small white head. Not fresh bready and grassy aroma (this is reasonably fresh bottle). Medium-bodied. Really sticky grassy, almost ganja.-style hoppyness. Hard mouthfeel. English style IPA --- weird beer.
"
1," Amber coloured, mid-sized off-white head, slowly diminishing; dark-malty - traces of roasted malt - nose with a metallic tinge; sweetish (-malty) bitter flavour, light to medium bodied; slightly drier malty-bitter finish with a faint, but lingering bitterness in the aftertaste. Not unpleasant at all...........
"
1," JUN 23, 2009 Hazy dark amber/brown. Dense and creamy medium-sized tan head. Pleasant and strong aroma of both sweet and fresh acidulous fruits. Notes of bubblegum, caramel and mild hops. Fruit and malts in the flavor; ripe green apples and grapes paired with light sweet caramellish malts. Some spice notes. Medium body. Smooth texture. Dry malty finish. Top end Dubbel.
"
1," Draft-Big River-Chattanooga, TN. This IPA was way too hoppy for my taste and palate. It had a small sized ivory head. The body was uncarbonated and clear with an orange hue. The nose was hoppy and the flavor was bitter and very hoppy. The mouthfeel was tingly and very hoppy. This was a medium bodied IPA with a fair lacing.
"
1," APR 26, 2005 Sampled at a small bar in Dijon, France during the France vs. England futbol game. I had heard that the Chimay we received in the states was a different recipe than what the Europeans received so once again, I gave this beer another chance.		Dark Brown.		Nearly non-existant aroma. Faint, but the slightest faint of brown sugar, plums and raisins.		Absolutely disgusting. Alcohol is very prominent. The mellow dark fruit flavors are hidden by the candy sugar and must ""dirt like"" overtones. But the worst thing about this beer is its complete lack of body.  Its every bottle as well.  Chimays beers just dont taste good.
"
1," Pours a tan creamy head that lingers.  Very dark in low light but when held up to a light, it reveals a remarkable ruby color.  Aroma of figs, molasses, toffee.  Taste is smooth, creamy...starts with taste of dates/raisins and fades to a malty-caramel sweet finish, ending with a touch of hoppy bitterness.  High ABV is well masked, only a slight warming sensation.  One of the finest beers Ive ever had.
"
1," this is a bit of a dodgy rating but this was the first german wheat beer i tasted so it left quite an impression. i tasted it 8 years ago when visiting a friend in passau. i couldn't get over how good it looked compared to flat aussie schooners of lager. i was also taken aback by the vanilla aroma and just how drinkable it was. i will have to try this one again
"
1," MAY 21, 2007 I recalled this being listed as 18% ABV and now I see someone has changed it to 7.5% ABV. (NOTE"
1," Dark brown porter with a thicj mucosy off-white head, Alcoholed filled choclate aroma with vanilla. Sharo alcohol knife cuts thorugh chocolate and roasted nuts, Grainy mouthfeel, rich body makes this an excellent beer.
"
1," Fine head, dark golden	Light nose, caramel, herbs and a little citrus	very lively w medium body and a fine length	Taste w. Orange, light caramel	A bit dissapointing
"
1," Tried this in Denver.  A bit fuity for my liking and not enough carbonation.  I am partial to the Pale Ales so the hoppiness just wasnt there.
"
1," A very generical IPA, not incredibly hoppy, lackluster aroma.  Balanced and easy drinking, refreshing.
"
1," Slightly bitter aroma, thick off white head. Light copper in appearance. Delicious taste, a great ale.
"
1," I got to taste an eleven year old Chimay Blue and it was life-changing - smelt like fruit cake and tasted like port. Mind boggling!
"
1," Hint of hops in the nose. Some sweet malt evident as well. Promising. Nice amber/red color. Nice lace. Hops! Now I know why its the 2nd highest rated Big River brew and the 11th highest in the state of TN. Still, there could be more flavor here. Needs to be sweeter to balance the Cascades.
"
1," MAY 5, 2004 The Brew Pours a very interesting Colour and Head. The Colour is dark and Murky like the Red. The Aroma is strong and unyeilding with the presence of Raisins and Plums and Caramel and Toffee.  The head is pronounced and creamy.  The Flavour is that of Roasted Malts, Toffee, Coffee, Raisin, Alcohol, Eggnogg, and Hopps. An extraordinary combination of flavours that is quite appealing to the Palate. This is a very good brew. One that I will have again and again.

1," Pours a hazy burnt orange with little head. Aromas of soft and dark fruits, spice, and bready yeast. Tastes plums, bananas, bread, and cloves. Great mouth feel with light small bubbles. Really nice dubbel.
"
1," Pours cloudy amber with a reddish hue. Has a thin to medium tan head with little to no lacing. Smells of caramel and hops. Tastes of bread, caramel and sweet malts. Leaves the palate with an exotic fruit & malt blend.
"
1," Very dark brown beer with light brown colar. Taste bit of coffee, toffe and chocolat.
"
1," Bottle.  My buddy Dave decided that I finally had to try this one.  It turned out to be just what I had guessed it would be... a pretty nice beer that has become overrated because it is now so mass produced.  Pours a nice dark plum color with hints of ruby.  Small particles float for a bit and sink to the bottom.  Big head, but not creamy and not very long lasting.  Nose is sweet, tart and sour with a great nose of Belgian yeast.  Taste is nice... a little yeast, a little maltiness, but a little too dry for my tastes.  It certainly is a good solid beer, but not even up to par with some American Belgian Ales.  Not much body and a good solid medium carbonation that fits the style well.  Well above average, but not an unbelievable beer.
"
1," JUL 30, 2008 as soon as teh bottle top is popped off you know this is something special; a real profusion of summer fruits, berries, caramels and other things that I am yet to work out. then it pours a dispersed sunset of graded colours; port red, brown and orange with a dark cream head. flavours are complex and shifting with a balanced, medium sweetness.
"
1," Clear golden with a medium off white head. Aroma had grassy hops, toasted malt and caramel. Flavour had grassy hops, caramel and toasted malt. Finished dry and slightly bitter.
"
1," Bottle.  Pours a deep chestnut color with very little head.  Aroma is an interesting blend of yeast, malt and some darker fruits.  Flavor is much the same - a bit on the sweet side, but very balanced and very enjoyable.  Alcohol is well masked.
"
1," (On tap) Nashville. Completely pitch black and opaque - barely any head. Almost vinous aroma of dried fruit and port wine. Flavours of lightly burned malt and then unfortunately - again - a strong fustiness spoiling what could have been a fairly nice Stout. God, why the f... dont these people keep their pipes clean? A bloody disgrace. 290306
"
1," A thick lasting foam that slowly goes down to a thin lace that then lasts untill finiched. Red orange color. Typical english spicy hop aroma. Taste is malty and litle spicy. Well fermented.
"
1," This bottle may have been faulty, as it foamed out of the lip of the bottle for a few minutes before I could pour.  When I did, though, it came out normal.  The result is a pretty standard, straightforward Belgain-type strong ae.  Reddish-brown in color with decent foam layering, moderately fruity aroma, standard Belgian strong taste, and wonderful mouthfeel.
"
1," Bottled(750ml). corked 2005, complex and full bodied brew, hoppy and alcohol nose, malty acidic flavor,  smooth palate, malty and yeasty aroma with slightly alcohol hints. Maybe Im wrong or something else, I dont know, but something is missing for  this to be the best Chimay
"
1," fragrant an lovely, another great recommendation by the whole foods market guys, thanks KEITH and COREY in columbus ohio, youg uys know what youre talking about
"
1," tasted along side the blue and white. this was the weakest of the three but a strong showing nonetheless
"
1," Pours sediment rich, dark brown color - opaque even when held to the light. Nice, frothy beige head that dissapates moderatly fast, Aroma of bananas. Nice mouthfeel - full, rich and bubbly, leaves a nice alcohol warmness in the back of the throat. Theres almost an astringent quality, my tongue sizzles from the carbonation, similar to drinking mineral water. I really like that. The flavor is pleasing. Malty, a bit fruity but not dominated by citrus, as many other brews are. Good stuff!
"
1," Poured from a 12 oz bottle. Hazy yellow in color with a thin head with very little lacing. Wheaty aroma with hits of citrus. Sweet with a slightly bitter finish.
"
1," Bottled.  Clear yellow, rich head. Sweetish, creamy and fruity. Fairly light boded with restrained hoppiness and low bitterness Clean flavoured and a bit too shy.
"
1," At the 2007 Big Beer, Belgians, & Barleywines Festival in Vail. I think that its odd that the brewer insists that this beer is a stout because it behaves much more like a barleywine. I suppose well just think of it as a hybrid. This does look like a stout- it is pitch black with a dark brown head. Fairly good sized head that hangs out atop the beer for a while. Aroma is not so good. Im not sure what it is I smell- turnips? The flavor is really nice with a huge chocolate and roasted taste. The smoothness is helped by a pronounced oat flavor. This could almost be a breakfast barleywine! Really good beer in spite of the odd aroma.
"
1," This is a blah beer. It has a nice amber, glowing color but lacks a lasting head. There is no aroma and has less flavor than their light lager. It's just bland. There is a bit of caramel and maybe a little wood. Quite smooth, but I've had better Viennas.
"
1," SEP 27, 2008 Draught at  the brewpub.  Probably pale amber, rich head. Buttery and minerally with equal parts metal, diacetyl and grass. Medium bodied with rounded mouthfeel. Caramelly finish with traces of blood.
"
1," Bottle pours a pale golden, slightly hazy, large white rocky head, strong carbonation, with lattice like lacing.   Estery aroma, spices, with some notes of citrus & earth.   Forwardly musty, earthy, slightly sweet, with some light spices.   Good body, medium mouthfeel.   Finish turns from a slightly sweet to a slightly salty, subtle spices, and bready.
"
1," (750ml bottle, BB 07/11, courtesy of blutt59)  Pours a clear yellow body with a medium white head.  Aroma of grass, Mountain Dew soda, straw, and florals.  Flavor of grass, florals, caramel, and earthiness with a bitter finish.
"
1," Thick in the head, it eventually sinks down into a thin layer of rich whipped cream on top of a glowing dark amber pool. The aroma is difficult to find, just a hint of earthy vanilla. This beer has a very finely balanced roller coaster ride of spiceyness and sweetness that strikes you in waves.  Big bitey nutmeg and cinnamon in the beginning, sweet doughy bread in the the middle, and a subdued acidic finish with a touch of hop bitternesss. Well executed, well balanced, well done. Be well.
"
1," A wonderful beer.  Nice orange and fresh corriander nose floating on top of a nicely carbonated wheat spiciness.  Not as phenolic as I prefer, but still the beer that made that first big impact on me so long ago.  Still the best brewpub in town.
"
1," (Draught)  Pours a black body with a medium-sized brown head.  Aroma of roasted malt and chocolate.  Flavor of rich chocolate, roasted malt, and light coffee with a bitter finish.
"
1," I know that this beer has been sampled more times than James Brown, so I will keep it short...............................	IT WAS GOOD =)
"
1," The beer appeared a deep ruby brown with an off whit head, served in a nice 20 oz mug.  The aroma was a mild malty blend of chocolate and roasted and a slight spicey hop aroma.  The flavor is clean roasted malt, and not too bitter.  The body is much more a brown ale similar to Newcastle, thin and watery, without much aftertaste.  This porter would probably please a lot of drinkers and encourage the brown ale drinker to order an occassional porter.
"
1," 750ml bottle split April 2011.  A beer Ive had numerous times before, and hold in high regard.  Unfiltered, muddy brown amber.  Sweet brown sugar, plum aroma.  Perfect interplay between the mild hops and effervescent carbonation.  Lots of caramel, raisin tones.  Comes off as smooth as a Dubbel, with the added complexities of a Tripel or Strong Ale.  An exceptionally well made beer, superb and universally appreciated.
"
1," Bottle.  Poured a dark brown with a huge brown head.  Aroma of dark fruits and malt.  Flavor shares the sweet malt and dark fruits, with a bitterness at the end.  Creamy on the palate.  Great beer that is overlooked most of the time.
"
1," Good ale, but I still prefer the Rouge and Blanc. Very flavourful, strong nose, but I feel the strong carbonation doesnt fit a beer this dark.
"
1," Delicious! Yeasty, fruity aroma. I sense plums and raisins. Feels wonderful in the mouth, nice carbonation which washes over the tongue. This is the beer to give to someone who argues that beer can't be as complex as wine. Beautiful.
"
1," This is my favorite out of the 3 CHIMAYs.  red in color. I received no head on this beer. Might be too cold! 330ml sweet malt aroma. medium sweetness, taste of soft fruit like plums.  I enjoyed this beer in a CHIMAY glass!
"
1," Hazy brown with a puffy cream colored head that lasts forever. Aroma of caramel, nuts, spice, raisins, earth, Belgian yeast and roasted malt. The taste is sweet malt and yeast with a nice mild bitterness and well blended alcohol. Full bodied, moderate carbonation.
"
1," Pours a cloudy dark chocolate chestnut brown with dark amber edges when held to a light source and a thick frothy, pillowy light tan head. Excellent retention, only slowly settling into a lasting cap that lasts throughout, leaving chunks of soapy lacing in its path.		Slightly spicy peppery aroma with a lot of sweet estery Belgian yeast, chocolate, candy sugar and dark fruits; plum, raisin, prune, fig, etc.		Soft carbonation up front that subdues a bit when the beer warms. Lots of sweet dark fruit character with hints of fige, prune, raisin and plum as well as some silky chocolate and caramel. Very faint sour presence with some pleasant spiciness. Theres some cinnamon, brown sugar and candy sugar that provides an excellent balance and complexity to this amazing beer. The alcohol presence is there but the high ABV is very well masked making it dangerously drinkable. One of my all time favorites.
"
1," It has been a long time since Ive had this one and noticed I hadnt rated it.  So I got a bottle looking to revisit an old favorite, but then was very underwhelmed by what I had.  Poured dark amber with a tan head.  The aroma has earthy caramel malt, Belgium yeast and light richness.  Medium / thin body with fairly sharp carbonation.  The taste starts with some astringency, light toffee, dry caramel and a bit of phenolic spice.  The finish is short and spicy.  An okay beer, but this came across as far from being a world class Trappist ale.  Hopefully i have a better experience with this and can add a more favorable rerate down the road.
"
1," Vom fass in the brewpub 22 Jun 07. Golden colored. A nice ""tulip"" that lasted. Hazy. Fruity aroma. Soft mouthfeel. Flavor of plums. Fruity and bitter aftertaste. Dry finish.

1, bottle		Reviewed on
1," Im a bit disappointed.  Rather than complex it feels like more of a flavor competition.  I dont think Id drink this again.  Too much bread, bananas and cereal in the mouth, too much grass on the aftertaste.  A heap of cheesey yeast still resides in my mouth.  Its not bad, but its not very good either.
"
1," 750ml bottle. chocolate coffee sweet aroma, very complex taste, vine-like. simply love it!brownish red, cloudy, medium sweetness, lightly bitter, lightly sour, long finish, soft carbonation, slick feel,
"
1," Poured from an 11.2 ounce bottle into my new Chimay glass this poured up one of the prettiest colors Ive ever seen, a dark ruby red.  The head was about  inch and did not go away.  The aroma was of caramel and spice and most pleasant.   The taste matched the aroma and the creamy mouth feel just added to it all.  Very good brew.
"
1,"  very full bubbly bodied head when poured.  yeasty smelling.  highly carbonated.  nice, dark red to deep carmel color, yet not opaque.  not really hopy, but very yeasty to the taste.  a high quality belgian (although not my favorite style brew.)
"
1," MAY 22, 2008 Aroma"
1," Cask at the GBBF 2009. I should have known this beer wasnt up to much since it was a whopping 7.5% but was still available at around 9pm on Wednesday of the festival. Really boring for something this strong. Aroma and flavours of banana bread. Not awful, but I really expected more.
"
1," Orange/Amber colour with a thin off-white head. Smells of malt are prominent. Medium-bodied; Decent hoppyness/malt balance in the taste-fairly fitting for a Vienna though. Aftertaste a bit bittering, but pretty good. Overall, a better than average Vienna! I had this on draught at Big River (owned by Gordon Biercsh) in Chattanooga, Tennesse on 26-September-2003.
"
1," Bottled. Light citrus, yeasty, malty aroma. Hazy, yellow color, white head, good lace. Sweet, malty, flowery, light bitter to bitter in the finish, soft and full. Like many German beers, not bad but not exciting.
"
1," grand reserve bottle.  pours deep deep amber with a cream head.  smells of sweet dark fruit.  has a bit of a spicy alcohol kick midway through
"
1," I love this beer when I am grilling out some filet mingons. I love the almost sparkling bubble/light bitter feeling when I take the 1st sip. Nice head on it however it seems to disappear pretty quick. Nice lightly soured finish to this reddish colored brew.
"
1," copper color, creamy head (that lasted way too long), very malty, was not a good one after yard work
"
1," draft - Pours copper colored with a moderate head that leaves some lacing.  Theres a good floral hop aroma.  The flavor features citrus hops supported by some caramel malt.  Medium bodied and lightly carbonated, Barfly has a long, bitter finish.  Maybe its better on tap as I was more impressed with this beer than most reviewers.
"
1," I dont know anything about these Belgian beers.  I know they are supposed to be the best in the world but I am still not convinced.  Though this was better than the last one it was still just alright.  It was as carbonated as a Coke.  It tasted pretty much like a Paulaner but a little more alcohol like.  $5 a 11 oz bottle was a rip, too.  Oh yeah, it reminds a lot of Steel Reserve high gravity.

"
1," very dark poor with a big frothy off-white head, dissipates slowly, but does dissipate leaving pretty good lacing.  The color is murky, a dark ruby, almost black in low light.    First aroma spike is alcohol, then followed by a faint wine smell.  A cherry, flowery smell comes through after, very nice aroma.  The palate is suprisingly light, with a creamy texture and a soft, but noticable carbonation.    The taste is sweet, with little to no bitterness.  Extremely smooth brew, very very nice.
"
1," Bottle 500ml. w. swing top.Clear medium yellow color with a average, frothy, good lacing, mostly lasting, white head. Aroma is light moderate malty, grain, hay, toasted, malty.

1," Bottle shared with Hogtown Harry, blankboy, and biegaman, courtesy of blankboy.  Decent roast aroma.  Dark brown, small white head.  Some chocolate in taste, very strong roast.  Very dry.  Good stuff.
"
1," very good, full pleasant beer that starts from the first smell.  Call it sacrilege though, but I still prefer the chimay white, but then I always prefer a bitter aftertaste.
"
1," Bottle (thanks mom!). Golden with a big white head that diminishes slowly - looks pretty good! Aroma is rather grainy with a bit of hoppy notes and maybe some grassy hints. Sweetish flavor with a rather bitter finish with some hops and metallic hints. Light to medium body. Pretty clean and drinkable.
"
1," On tap at new location in Broad Ripple. Pours cloudy reddish golden. Nose is fresh citrus and floral hops. Taste is nice fresh citrus hops, fruit forward with a slight barrel flavor in the finish. Becomes dry and bitter, and is overall pretty light, but solid for an ipa. Not a bad offering.
"
1," Pours dark amber with medium beige head. Unremarkable aroma. An ordinary Keller, not great but quite drinkable.
"
1," I cant write anything about Chimay that the previous 2000 reviewers havent already said.  Great beer, but IMO, its worth the extra couple of bucks to buy the blue or white instead of the red.  With that said, the red is still world class.
"
1," JAN 2, 2005 750ml. Hazy orange-brown in the glass, with a nice creamy tan head and lacing.  Pleasant fruity aroma.  Flavor is yeasty, fruity, malty, with Chimays trademark yeast immediately apparent. Light in the mouth with astringent and dry finish. Not much alcohol presence and a little thin. Nice dubbel, but not as nice as the price and hype would have you believe.  A little better than the White or Bleu.
"
1," There is not much to this beer.  Light malt aroma.  Minimal hops and a gold color.  It is too light and thin.

1," Pours Brown, with a tan almost creamy head, sweet ripen fruit aroma, fruity flavour with hints of chocolate, spice & alcohole like finish. If you try it in room temp. you might taste strong raisin flavour, I like this one
"
1," Bottle. Dark brown, clear, medium almond head. Aroma is unusual, to say the least. Medicinal mint is prominent, with notes of chocolate, caramel. My wife says it tastes just like a Junior Mint in a glass. I agree, with a decent balance between the fresh mintiness and sweet chocolate. Medium dry bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is on the thin side of medium-bodied. Unusual flavours that left me wondering if Id want to have another. Im still not sure.
"
1," 5.0%. Clear medium orange yellow colour with a fizzy, virtually no white head. Aroma is moderate apple and pear, wood, moderate to light heavy pear, light barnyard and leather. Flavor is moderate to light heavy sweet and light acidic with a average to long duration, dry. Body is medium, texture is oily, carbonation is flat, finish feel is light alcoholic. [20110805]
"
1," Darak red-brown with an off-white head.  Aroma was earthy with a slight flowery smell, not very strong though (may have been too cold).  Complex flavor is tough to describe, apart from saying its good - malty, fruity, earthy, with a dry, warm finish.  I really liked this beer.

1," Clovey raisin spice, some fresh dough.  Cloudy deep amber, big head with nice lacing.  Orange peel seared in honey sweetness/bitterness flavor, funky bitterness.  Medium to full body, creamy big carbonation, strong and long finish.  Solid beer, great complexity, just enough alcohol to keep it approachable.

1," 12 ounce bottle. Pours a murky brown/red color with a medium beige head. A sweet nose of oak, roast, sweet fruit and cocoa. The flavor is not your usual Quad thats for sure; sweet chocolates, some slight sourness, rich sweet fruity malts, oak, lots of woodiness. Nice and very warm. It rounds out to be a woody and chocolaty version of a nice quad, well made and very aggressive. Nice.
"
1," Clear Holden with. Creamy white head. Cereal grain and citrus aroma and taste with a soapy finish.
"
1," Poured dark copper with no real head tasted caramel bread and yeast very good beer but not my favorite chimay butn good non the less
"
1," The beer pours a hazy dark brown with orange highlights - and a thin off-white head. The aroma smells of sweet malts, fruit (figs, prunes), hints of spice, and yeast. The flavor has strong carbonation zip that almost bites the tongue The beer starts with a little sweetness and a little acid. The full taste of malts and hints of hops enter in the middle. There is an interesting combination of chocolate, fruit., and yeast. The beer finishes malty, but dry and light with a lingering aftertaste of yeast, malts, and hops (in that order).
"
1," bottle thanks to mmm///beer.  deep ruby color with a 1 finger cream head.  great hoppy, citrusy and slight spicy scent.  good thickness and a mild hop flavor that isnt bitter.
"
1," Darkish brown. Pours thick. Fruity nose. Very malty, velvetty mouthfeel, some butterscotch and toffee. Late bittterness. Complex.
"
1," A golden ale with a very thin head.  Nice aroma of esters and spice.  Nice belgian yeasty flavor and lingering yeasty/bready finish.
"
1," JUN 28, 2009 Upping it to 4.3 from 3.8 of a few years ago.  Still quite on the fizzy side, though thats better than being on the flat side for sure.
"
1," Nice and smooth, just like the other two Chimays. Brown in appearance. Not the least bit challenging, but if you want something unparalled in smoothness and the ability to mess you up, this is your beer.
"
1," En udemrket trippel. Humlen er for bitter og for lidt aromatisk for min smag.
"
1," The Chimay Blue poured a murky, cloudy, caramel brown color.  It had a big off-white head that had great retention.  It had a rather subtle aroma...yeasty and winey with some oak and a faint fig smell.  It had a complex taste that is pretty difficult to describe.  A kind of tart, figgy taste up front with some oak and winey tones and a slighty spiced finish.  It was a nicely balanced, smooth beer.  A great beer for special occasions.
"
1," Figgy, fruity, wafting thru one's nose. Appearance"
1," Bottle at home. Deep brown color with big not lasting white head.  Nice trappist with not (for Belgium) too much alcohol.
"
1," Virtually no aroma, what was there was mild citrus, peat and brown sugar. Tannic, dry, nutty and made with quality malt. Mildly hopped, medium finish. Palate was a bit watery, and it needed a bit more fizz and kick.
"
1," Bottle - Rich copper color with a fluffy, creamy head.  The flavor is of fruits and sugar.  The aroma hints at whats to come in the flavor.  The mouthfeel is full, but not heavy.  A well rounded Dubbel.
"
1," 11.2oz bottle from grape & gourmet. pours a very eye pleasing reddish-brown with a thick, creamy off-white head and light lacing. aroma is great with unique, sweet, floral notes of rose and tulip backed by dried raisins and black cherries, belgian yeast, light spice, and caramel with hints of red wine and cedar. flavor is delicious as well with big, bold, belgian spices and yeast up front with dried, dark fruit notes of cherry, raisin, and fig at mid palate with hints of red apple skins, toffee, and sweet malts rounding out the sip. palate is full bodied with heavy carbonation and a nice, spicy/sweet finish with a touch of boozy warmth. overall, a great belgian strong. i can see why this one is still rated over a 4 with 2700+ ticks.
"
1," excellent Ale, i would consider this the a toss up between blue  for the best .
"
1," Another great trappist beer from Belgium. Complex flavor. Roasty malt with bitter caramel. It leaves a nice syrup sensation on the tongue. A sure value
"
1,"		At least today this was far superior to the pils unless they called them by the wrong name. One of the few of the style I have ever had with actual flavor. No flaws, bready, and a nice floral hop finish.		The biggest surprise of the the day for me.
"
1,")		Pours a dark brown, with a frothy, but not thick, head that dissipates slowly. Looks really nice, and is asking to be consumed. Smells really nice - mixture of malt, caramel and fruit, mainly banana. Tastes very strong, with notions of malt, fruit and yeast. Sometimes sweet, sometimes bitter. Palate is very smooth, and leaves a tingling feeling on the tongue.
"
1," Courtesy Secret Santa. Calling this ""premium"" is a stretch; I would label it pale lager but what do I know. Aroma was weak. Light malt is faint. Pour was a light gold with a one finger white head. Taste was blah. Sugar water, metal and light malt with a sticky sweet aftertaste and little carbonation. I will forgive this beer since it made a long trip here in a green bottle.
"
1," 25 oz. bottle.  Pours brown with off-white head. Fruity aroma with raisins. Smooth mouthfeel with a satisfying finish.  An absolutely stellar beer!
"
1," MAY 20, 2007 11.2 oz bottle.. I had this last night because i hadnt tried it in forever, and I was glad I did.  It was expensive as hell, but worth it.  On the pour, good head, dark brown-red color, lots of carbonation.  Smell was fruity, cola-like spice.  The first taste was amazing, far better than what I remember.  Tasted like a lively brown ale, with a belgian-sweet finish. Nice warm alcohol notes.  Top notch!
"
1," Sweet and floral aroma.  Hazy brown with a pillowy white head.  Moderately sweet and a bit dry; hints at fruit (mellon?) and spice.  Overall very subtle but eloquent.
"
1," Bottle. Poured dark brown with a medium beige head. Yeasty aroma with fruity notes of raisins and hints of brown sugar. Flavour is spicy and sugary with caramel and a touch of alcohol.
"
1," Ever since the Rohefort 6 Ive been in love with Trappist beer.  This weekend Im finally going to Illinois ot pick up the Rochefort 10 but I figured that the Chimay would tie me over until the weekend.  Full and beautiful as only a trappist can be with hints of chocolate and toffee in every sip.  The aroma is less fruity than an Aventinus and all delicious beer.  This one really surprised me.
"
1," APR 26, 2004 Head is light tan, mostly diminishing, good lacing. Liquid is dark blood red under high intensity light, lots of carbonation, this is a Belgium brew. Nose on the pour is spicy warm cinnamon, yeast, carbonation and alcohol. Flavor is spicy, carbonation, well balanced. After taste is alcohol warm and slightly bitter. Good, but not my idea of a good beer, not a big Belgium beer fan, too much yeast and carbonation spoils the palate, IMO.
"
1," This Beer Poured a golden color. It had a fruity aroma and a sweet malty flavory
"
1," Pours dark amber thin white head, the ""heavy hitter"" of the night. Maltiness with a lot of bitter hops, the bitterness takes over the slight sweetness trying to come out.
"
1," OCT 25, 2007 Small bottle.   Was given a gift of a large bottle in 1996 soon after I started brewing.  I remember being at awe thinking about drinking beer made by monks.  Chimay blue was spectacular, and gave me a brewing goal.  I thought it was the best beer.  Around 2001-2002, I started to think the red version was better.  It was also about this time it seems Chimay was mass producing.  It wasnt until years later around 2003, that I started to appreciate many other beers, with a huge influence from ratebeer.  Now, Im finally rating my old favorite.  I probably havent tried it in over a year.  Pours with a head that disappears immediately.  There still carbonation, but just no head.  Hmmm?  Aroma of something fruity, not quite banana.  A bit too much alchohol in the nose.  Deep brown red amber color.  Great color.  Taste is good, on the sweeter side, but something is off, possibly the tiniest amount sourness.  Not quite the masterpiece I once thought it was.  Is it because of mass production, or improved taste buds.  I wonder if I could get a hold of an older bottle. 7/3/7/3/16"
1," (bottle) Clear and dark amber colour with a foamy and steady off-white head. Sweet and slightly toasted malty aroma with caramel, slightly tart. Sweet malty taste, caramel, slightly sour, medium to light bodied, dry, hoppy and malty finish. This one has a distinctive tart aroma and taste, which is  pleasant or not  not more than decent.
"
1," Bottle shared by Dogbrick. Clear gold pour with a thin white head. Aroma of Belgian yeast, malt, banana and pepper. Banana dominates the flavor, which also consists of sweet malt and honey.
"
1," Had at the brewpub. Called ""Barrel Aged Altbier"". Has a nice woody character with a distinct bourbon/whiskey flavor. Smooth texture with a sweet malt finish.
"
1," Probably my favorate beer (certainly my favorate of the three commonly availible Chimays).  A very powerful ale with strong (but not overwhelming by any means) bitterness; a nice malty and woody taste, with a long, lingering aftertaste.  A beer to be savored slowly.
"
1," Bottle conditioned, 330ml, aged 7.5yrs. This sample was old before I had it so could have a couple of years extra, it had the shield on the cap rather than the current wording. Dark brown with ruby hints, slight head. I love Chimay Bleu to be aged, the flavours amalgamate into a porty, smooth blend with caramel and burning alcohol. The spiciness has matured to where the flavours cannot be picked, it a fireside warmer on a cold winters night, warm in the glow that your football team has just won, a pleasing and hearty friend. If you are patient with this beer it will reward you with ageing. Lovely.
"
1," Great Belgian beer. I like the flavour of malt and hops in this, which sometimes goes missing in Belgian beers to sugars and spices. Nicely done.
"
1," Nice, nutty, lightly sweet aroma.  Cherrywood orangey beer.  Dry, nutty, very lightly sweet, medium hopping. Good with food. Fairly quick finish with mild astringency.
"
1," AUG 9, 2003 What's great about this beer?  Well, it's always available and might make for a decent convert beer for those who haven't tried Belgians.  Other than that?  While good, I honestly don't understand all the fuss about this dubbel.  Color is alright, but not a standout among the style.  Aroma is nice, but a little lacking, in my opinion.  And flavor...well it lacks a whole lot of character, which I find in the style from Westmalle and Corsendonk.  Compared to the greats of the style, this one just doesn't make the mark, as much as we all seem to want it to.
"
1," FEB 1, 2007 Bottled from Cruzat Beer House, Buenos Aires.  Upon opening it spray painted the roof, walls, bed and floor of my tiny hotel room, then it kept overflowing for ages. After Id finished cleaning the room itwas still overflowing. Upon pouring it came out opaque black with rich beige head. The aroma of green apples mixed with sugar hinted me that it was a very sweet beer, and this was confirmed upon first taste. Besided a little bit of chocolate the porter charcateristics are vague. Instead its a mild beer with rounded mouthfeel and low bitterness. Once it reached room temperature it improved, as the green apples in the nose were replaced by more chocolate.
"
1," Very creamy head.  Nice fruity aroma.  Soft, thick, creamy on the tongue.  Well balanced.
"
1," Hazy amber-red copper, with orangeish highlights, and a foamy tan-colored head. Nice fruity and spiciness, caramelized malt, brown sugar aromas follow through on a medium-bodied palate with a good carbonation and a multitude of small bubbles tickling the tongue, with fruity note of dates, brown sugar, toffeish hint, caramelized malt, spicy nutmeg, leading towards a sweet malty and a shy flowery hops finish.
"
1," 11.2 oz bottle purchased in a gift pack from Spirits in RB. Ok this beer is lack luster in the appearance department pouring a murky muddy brown with slight burgundy hues and a nice creamy off white head that lasts very nicely. After the initial let down on the appearance this beer picks its game up big time. Sweet aroma of raisins, prunes, yeast, brown sugar, tropical fruit and a slight touch of alcohol perhaps Brandy. This gem has one of the most amazing palates I have ever experienced. Starts off with a full mouth feel and lively carbonation but as you swallow the body becomes light and the carbonation lessens to slide down your throat. Almost no aftertaste leaves you wanting another sip to recapture that moment of pure palate bliss. Sweet flavor of light yeast, sugar, raisin, and brown bread. I wasnt expecting much from a beer so widely available but this might be soething that I stock on a regular basis. Bravo Chimay Bravo.
"
1," Very reddish brown color with slightly off-white head.  Very fruity and rich smell.  Sweet fruitful flavor.  Very nice aftertaste. Probably my favorite beer Ive tried to date.
"
1," Bottle, smallish head, murky darkish orange colour, funky aroma of sour cabbage and sewer, strong overpowering vinrgar flavour leaving nothing behind. This brew is infected, real shame i dont have another one to try.
"
1," Sedona Bronze Ale. Clear, dark brown/bronze. Minimal head. Nutty aroma maybe a bit of raisin, sweet to taste, a bit smoked flavor and a light sweet chocolate aftertaste. Good stuff.
"
1," Pours pitch black with a fully receding dark mocha head. Aroma of mild roast, chocolate, some restrained esters. Taste is vinous malt, dark chocolate sweetness, and a bit of charcoal. Mouthfeel is full bodied, smooth with soft carbonation. Mild aroma, but the taste and texture were certainly enjoyable.
"
1," Little head blonde coloured. Nose with orange, light candis and sugar, a little sourness. Semifullbodied an some length. Taste is sweet with some orange and orange peel and sugar. Its quite sweet, but wellballanced and mould probably age well.
"
1," 4 oz draft sample at brewpub. Pours a deep black with a slight tan head. Aroma is big coffee with some bready malts in the background. Taste is typical coffee stout with a very milky creamy taste. Lots of roasted grains and no hoppiness. Mouthfeel is a little on the thick side. Great for coffee lovers, but if you dont like coffee, this one is pretty hard to drink especially compared to some of the better coffee stouts out there.
"
1," rerated.	a lot better, although this time it was a grand reserv 2001, some would say this is the reason why the beer is a bit different.  anyway, excellent
"
1," APR 16, 2005 Bright brick amber colour; finger of dense foam denotes either a richly hopped beer or a frothier gas mixture.  Probably the latter given the faintness of the nose - a little bit of herbal hop but little else.  The palate is crisp, with some wood-oven notes and earthy, caramelly undertones.  The finish is accented towards the foresty (American-style) end of the spectrum, but the hops are restrained and balanced by slight earthiness of yeast and malt, in the English style.
"
1," Poured an orange amber color with a small white head.  The aroma and flavor have mostly citrus hops but some earthy ones as well.  Caramel malt controls the hops.  Light to medium bodied.
"
1," Aroma is some pumpkin and spices. Appearance is a dark golden color with a white head. Flavor is dull with only a hint of pumpkin. The palate is a bit thin. Overall not great.
"
1," 3 0z Sample at the brewpub downtown Chattanooga. Nice dark golden pour with a fine head. Finaly! After five tastings a decent beer! Grapefruit sweet fruity nutty bold with some pine notes ( I love adding those notes!) has a bold finish and just might be my beer of the night!
"
1," Brownish red, sizey head. Sweetish, bitter aroma. One might be tempted to call the aroma ""bittersweet"", but to me that makes it sound like the aroma is pining for an old girlfriend or something like that. It may be, I dont know, but concepts like ""pining for an old girlfriend"" are really tough to pin down in an aroma. Nice hints of caramel at first, and some grainyness, too. May a bit of a cardboardy flavor, too. Sampled at Noogfest2 (and thanks to argo0 for sharing some)
"
1," Bottle from Nelson Wines. It pours hazy medium brown with red highlights and has a very thin beige head. The nose is sweet fig, date, caramel, wood, tangerine and winter spices. The taste is wood, caramel, smoke, tobacco, orange, orange blossom, dark fruit and honey, with a long woody finish. Theres no denying its a decent brew, but it really lacks the drinkability and complexity of the Bleue.
"
1," Poured an unfiltered, deep copper-brown with medium head.  This brew is typical of Belgian ales.  It had the strong, full taste of raisins and plums to go with a smooth finish.  Excellent beer.  Ive often seen it, but never tried it until now.  Full of carbination, its definitely the champagne of beers!
"
1," Pours golden with a nice orange head. The aroma is nicely complex yet not very strong. There was notes of oranges, grapefruit, ketchup, and a touch of spicy mustard. The flavor was citrusy and fruity with a nice malt backbone. Definitely hop forward though. Easy drinking and tasty IPA.
"
1," Hazy Yellow pour with faint whit head.  Light wheat nose with a hint of yeast.  Thick wheat body with a smooth easy finish.
"
1," Bottle, like in the name red colour, small head, mild sweet, yeasty, balanced caramel taste, too strong copper taste - like you smell on a 1 eurocentcoin. The Chimay red is in my opinion the best chimay!
"
1," An old trappist that is new again! A cloudy dark caramel hued pour. Big off-white creamy head. Dies down slowly and leaves a ton of lacing. Smells malty, yeasty, and a bit metallic. Taste is bitter and sweet. Dry. A bit of a yeast taste lending a pepper bite. Carbonic bite. A little more sweet than bitter in the back. Reminds me of Chimay Rouge.
"
1," NOV 1, 2010 Small bottle. Cloudy verging on opaque. Thick head fades to just a coating. ends up looking like a puddle of rusty water. Yeast, prunes, red berries and flowers on the nose. Complex fruity taste. Carbonated mouthfeel, but not excessive. Alcohol is noticeable but integrated. The malt registered for me more as body than taste. Long dry finish. [4.1]Big bottle, 2010 vintage. Pretty much as above, just rating it as slightly ugly this time. Theres nothing very _exciting_ about this if youve tried a few brews of its ilk - nothing really stands out at all. And thats precisely its charm"
1," Bottle, 750ml.  Had this at the Bier Markt in Toronto.  Best served at room temperature.  Pours a dark amber with a decent amount of head.  Let the beer sit a few minutes to let it breathe before consuming.  Nice aroma with hints of cinamon and orchard fruits.  This is the first Chimay Ive had and I loved every sip I took.  It tastes like a strong Leffe, with a sweet flowery taste, and a fruity aroma that stays with you until the last sip.  This beer isnt for everyone however.  It is very complex, and is not a beer one should be encouraged to chug.  Can be complimented with a hearty meal, or just had on its own.  Either way I loved it!
"
1," DEC 14, 2011 pours nice dark mahogany with a tanned head. aroma of dark fruits, caramel and brown sugar. taste is rich and sweet. there are dark fruits, cloves, and floral spice. there is a nice silky texture, with just the right amount of carbonation. quite a strange mineral quality in the finish, and its not as deep/complex as some, but its still really good.
"
1," Dark brown with reddish shine. Medium-thick, slightly coloured head, collapsing. Very strange meaty smell, like gelatine in a meatpastry, and arachide (peanut)oil or -butter. Metallic nose too, and after some time, dark malts and just a hint of hops. Very little bit metallic taste, then roasted malts, spicey - don't dare to say hops - and, definitely, salts. There is some salty whiff in this brew. Retronasal again meaty - and fruity notes, or preserved fruit. Rather light-bodied, certainly for its 7% ABV. Something velvety, however, on the tongue. The wheat 'flour' showing? I cannot follow people who praise this to heaven, nor those who will see nothing but a commercially denaturated product in this beer. An above average, reasonnable beer.
"
1," 330 ml bottle, served in a chimay glass. A dark cola brown color, with a dense medium head. It has a malty and alcoholic aroma. The beer itself is spicy and has a hot mouthfeel and a malty taste. The less good of the Chimay beers, but still a good beer.
"
1," Pours a cloudy coppery red color with a white head.The aroma is a fruity apricot.The flavor is a rather nice fruity sweetness.The  texture is silky smooth and finish is a very light bitterness.Overall very good.
"
1," Aroma - sweet malt, Carmel, plums. Appearance - Dark orange with fluffy head and sediment floating all over. Flavor - sweet malt, a little dark fruit, nuts, a little hops. Palate - medium body, creamy, lively, lightly astringent finish. Overall - This is a great beer. Very drinkable and it possesses great flavor and balance.
"
1," Pint on tap at Seven Bridges Brewpub in Jacksonville.  I have no idea if this is the right beer, with so many American pale ales and different brewpubs being all thrown together here.  Its just not worth the hassle to try and sort it out on Ratebeer sometimes.  So I sticking it in here anyway.  They just called it an American Pale ale without any cutsey name.  The bartender said it was between 5.25 and 5.5 abv.  And the beer was damn good.  Had a good hoppy APA aroma, and a really nice APA flavor.  Good malty body to go with the hops and a mildly bitter finish.
"
1," Full bodied. Port-like. One of the best.
"
1," Bottle. Pours brownish with a lit of fizz and a lot of head. Sweet fruitiness all over. Sweet fruits, honey, herbs, etc in the flavor. Didnt like it as much as I thought I would...
"
1," Again, used the Chimay glass for this one. Very nice smell, the trappist glasses really open up the aromas of these beers.  Spicy and fruity. flavor is slightly malty, I probably shouldve let this warm up a bit more as it was pretty cold and the flavor was a bit on the short side. Still a nice beer.
"
1," Grand Reserve 2000. Poured dark red with a white head. Aroma of plums, raisins, and a hint of booze. Very smooth fruit texture with some a hint of booze in the finish.
"
1," 11.2 Oz Bottle-Pours a cloudy brown color w/a slight tan head & good lacing. Floral Belgian aroma. Light, nutty, fruity, taste, with some traces of dates, figs, appricots & raisins. Crisp clean flavor w/a long dry finish. Pretty good, was expecting a little more.
"
1," OCT 23, 2003 From a 330 ml bottle. Commercial description has it about right, color is appealing brown, the head itself taste pretty good. Overall the beer is pretty sweet, caramelic and pleasant with an enjoyable bitterness that pops in right on time. Complex and easy to drink for a trappist. Pure quality.
"
1," Plastic bottle from omhper (big thanks, Ill try getting you some new sahtis for this one!). Hazy nutbrown colour, no head. Aroma is freshly cut juniperwood along with some spiced and xylitolish hints. Flavour is the same. Very refreshing! The bottle got lots of preassure in it so while letting a bit of it out, I also poured a small sample. Rest of the bottle is to be saved for PBF2007. Hides the alcohol very well!
"
1," Nice nutty taste. With the gimicky name of the brewery I didnt have high expectations. Quite a nice beer though. I could taste hops, and a smooth creamy nutty flavor. It poured out with a nice head but that quickly disappeared. That was a little disappointing.I would buy it again though.
"
1," From the tap poured dark brown with a good amount of head.  Nice toasted malt flavor with a lingering finish.
"
1," Bread and hay aroma, light grass hops, golden beer that has great aroma, medium carbonation and clean finish.
"
1," NOV 9, 2003 2003 Dark amber. Light brown frothy head. Sharp spicy aroma. Slight bitters and sweet. Not over powering. Good balance in everything. Carbonated palate that is still smooth. Slight wheatiness. Warming and no noticable alcohol flavour.
"
1," A good fruity drink with a mild hoppiness throughout. Pours orange and cloudy with a medium creamy head. A short lived tart aftertaste follows as you progress thru your drink. No punches here, its a decent brew.
"
1,"  Cask at National Winter Ales Festival, Manchester 2008  Poured darkish brown some malt and sourness on the nose. Tasted very disappointing, really quite rough and fierce. The bitterness was good but aside from that I struggling for positives, sour at times and then the sweetness of the malts come through,  it came across as a ropey homebrew I afraid.
"
1," MAR 29, 2011 Hazy amber pour, with a very healthy head. The superb taste sets this beer apart from others, with an alcohol content to leave your tongue tingling. 4.7 	RE-RATE 3/29/11 Bottle from World Market.  This beer pours elegantly.  No other word can describe it.  It has a hazy maroon color that touches on brown and rouge tints.  Lots of bubbles add to the already solid beige head.  Very nice.		Ive continued to warm this beer as much as I can through natural means as I know this will release all the aromas that the brewers have intended.  The aroma certainly does not disappoint.  Lovely dark fruit and sweet Belgian candied sugars fill the nostrils.  Easy grains and more Belgian fruit/yeast flavors follow behind.  Lovely.		Flavor is lovely grape juice, plum, raisin, sweet malt, sugar and Taylor Swift.  I imagine that if Taylor were a beer she would be sweet and innocent.  I mean that in the most non-creepy way possible.  Light bitter finish reminds you that this beer has a bit of a kick to it; and the tingle on the tongue confirms.  This is one of my favorite beers to date.
"
1," Redbrown colour with beige head.	Disappointing aroma dominated by yeast and spices.	Sweet but watery flavour with notes of fruit and spices.	I must admit, I prefer the trappist beers from Westvleteren, Rochefort and Achel.
"
1," This brown ale pours a fairly transparent brown amber colour with a small head. Hardly any lacing, this light bodied brown leaves you wondering if there could have been more. Pleasent, yet not very complex it is a friendly tasting brew.
"
1," There is no doubt that this is one of the big Trappist beers and synonymous with Belgian ales. A murky brown in colour with moderate carbonation. The aroma has dried fruits and prunes with some roasty chocolate type aroma there too. Flavour is quite full with some slight alcoholic hotness. This is not my favourite style of beer but theres no doubting its the epitamy for this style.

1," DEC 31, 2008 750 ml. into a margarita glass for lack of a Trappist glass.    Rich honey brown pour with a healthy foamy off-white head that holds and provides nice lacing.  Aromas of sweet malt and honey.  Flavors include hints of honey, sweet malt, cherries, fruit juice, and more.  Soft, smooth, and light on the palate with little carbonation - a bit to watery for my taste, but fits the style and light flavor.    Overall"
1," best beer I have ever tasted, high alcoholic, best drink with chimay cheese

1," Pours a deep ruby with a huge, foamy tan head. Fruity aroma, with a bit of malt and yeast. Flavours of raisins, cherry, and coriander. Very smooth, creamy feel, with a nice hint of alcohol. Seriously amazing.

1," APR 28, 2011 In bottle; pours red/brown colour with beige head. Aroma is sweet, almost like caramel. Taste of plums and fruit with a little sweet ending.

1," 750 ml bottle a dark brown colored beer with a beige head aroma sweetness/ caramel yeast malts and spices taste dry fruit sweetness malts and a bitter aftertaste
"
1," apples and grapes make up the primary flavor for me.  Bready malts are evident with clove and other spices coming through.  Finishes with brown sugar, spice, and a slight boozy touch.  Medium bodied with a frothy mouthfeel and a medium level of carbonation.  Despite being a bit thin, I feel the rating is appropriate mostly in part to its impeccable balance.  The tastes all compliment each other very well with nothing standing out too much or too little.  This leads to a very easy to drink, great brew.
"
1," Bottle @ Chauccers Pub.  A fairly unexpected darker beer.  Amazingly sweet aroma with floral undertones and a dark sugar smell.  Somewhat unexpected dry palate and a nice, but bland, taste.  Not too much carbonation. Taste of light chocolate and spices.  		Overall, I liked this beer, not as much as the ABT12, but still a enjoyable beer with a decent mouth feel and a SENSATIONAL aroma.
"
1," Delicious beer. I experienced it for the first time a few weeks ago as a birthday present.  Shared it with my parents.  Boy oh boy. Delicious flavor, infinitely drinkable.  Hints of fruitiness.  A joy to drink.  Perhaps I will re-rate with more specifics once I pick myself up an official Chimay bottle for the adventure.
"
1," Bottle. Dark brown colour with a large head. Aroma of malts, fruits and yeast. The flavour is sweet, malty, fruity and a bit  toffeeish. Mediuml-bodied, alcohol is hidden well. Nice and complex brew.
"
1," Pours a cloudy redbrown beer, off-white creamy head. Smells like caramel, banana and raisins, applepeal. A pleasant slightly prickling mouthfeeling. Sweet malty at first, followed by caramel and raisins. Ends with light roasted malt flavour and a little sour.
"
1," 22oz caged bomber. Pours an awesome reddish brown with a big fizzy off white head that dissipates quickly. Huge aromas of figs, raisins a great smelling yeast and a touch of alchohol. Taste opens up with raisins, ends with a little hoppiness for balance and a big yeasty malty note filled with cherries and vanilla. The super long and dry finish lingers forever with notes of chocolate and vanilla. The best of the Chimays.

1," Bottle. Black body with a light brown head. The aorma is strong coffee with dark chocolate. I also got a walnut charcter along with molasses. The taste is light coffee with the molasses, if the sweetness was toned down. Very roasted flavor with some wlanuts in the finish. Definitely dominated by the coffee. A nice coffee stout.
"
1," Amost always the best beer you can find when you find it. Its mocha and berry character are so beautiful and its musty yeast strain is one of a kind.
"
1," 0.75l bottle @ RBNAG11. This one pours a clouded copperish body with a nice medium and sidesticking just off-white head. Aroma is lightly anonymous, not non-existing but I kinda had expected a bit more. Anyhow, it has tones of citrus, orange, orange zest, hints of yeast. Lively to aggressive carbonation with a fizzing-oily mouthfeel. Flavors are blended beautifully, some leafs, light Belgian- yeasty tones, some strong alcohol hints towards the finish. A good Belgian
"
1," Very heavy, very fresh stout. Tasted at the Chattanooga Big River.
"
1," Bottiglia, colore ambrato scuro molto opaco, impenetrabile, buon cappello di schiuma persistente. Aroma potente di malto e lievito, decisamente sgradevole. In bocca dolce, completamente sbilanciata, stucchevolissima, sembra un big babol. Amaro moscio nel finale. Mi aspettavo decisamente meglio.
"
1," Smells faintly of a farm yard. Hazy chestnut brown colour. Pretty well carbonated. Really nice body full of mellow malt and hints of almond, nutmeg and freshly sawn soft wood. Nice short lived bite on the finish of mainly hidden alcohol. Nice.
"
1," Aromas are almost sharred roasted malt, very subtle hints of the barrel flavors ,a little of the maple vanilla fragrance,and just a touch of the bourbon spike, flavor is roasted malting,bakers chocolate, more of the bourbon sharpness but buy now means overpowering, ,roasted smooth alcohol finish,satisfying
"
1," Big bready nose with raisins, dates, a touch of fresh plum, and alcohol.  Sweet right up front with more dates, bread dough, raisin, dates, prunes, coco,  and other dark fruits.  Finishes fairly dryer then expected but with a fair presence of roasted grains, prunes, molasses, and milk chocolate.
"
1," NOV 21, 2004 Absolutely one of the very best beers Ive ever had the pleasure of enjoying.  A very strong, but not at all overpowering.  8% beer usually has too stout of a taste for me.  This is the most incredibly tasty and smooth beer around.  The higher than average alcohol content is just an added bonus.
"
1," Bottle from warehouse wine.  Pours a murky brown, almost cooper. Medium head. Aroma is yeast, banana, citrus. Taste is good, banana citrus, maybe some apples, pretty fruity. Palate is good with medium mouthfeel. Smooth finish. Pretty good beer overall.
"
1," 12oz bottle pours pale brown with a short creamy tan head that leaves some lace.  Aromas of toasted malts, some nuts, and some light earthy hops.  Flavors of toasted malts, brown sugar, some nuts, and slight hops at the finish.  A fairly thin palate takes away some from this brew.  Drinkable though.

1," bottle, thanks to bu11zeye, golden amber pour with buttery caramel and tropical fruit aroma, sweet caramel and buttery flavor with an odd perfumey finish
"
1," The chimay-taste is quite obvious. I think it is the best Chimay and it is a good competitor to the other trappist dubbel ales.
"
1," NOV 23, 2004 Copper coloured with a nice thick off-white head.  Spicy and citrusy hop character, caramel malt, and soft carbonation.  Nice.  A bit hoppier than the Narwhal Pale Ale, but with many of the same characteristics.  Dry-hopping is noticable and well-appreciated.
"
1," Velig god, men mangler litt fylde og alkohol.  Er litt kort i munnen i forhold til Bl....
"
1," Deep brown hue, small but thick head, leaves ample and attractive lacing. Mild nutty aromas and flavors, very smooth palate. Must have been served up fresh at the Central bar, because I had 3 of these and none yielded any sourness.

1," JAN 18, 2009 	Name"
1," JUL 21, 2007 Vry flavorful much like the blue with a slight decrease in the alcohol feel.  Pours a dark brown with lacy head.  Fruitful aromas, flavor is sweet with a noticeable alcoholo kick.  Very good beer, however I wont drink it if there is any blue in the room.
"
1," Bottle. Dark reddish brown . very malty, strong raisin and brown sugar in the nose. Thick head with great retention.  Sweet almost caramel finish. Slightly dry and boozy bite at the finish. Deserves its ranking
"
1," Poured from 12 oz bottle, enjoyed after a Blackhawks win!  Aroma is mostly of cloves and spices, not really my cup of tea.  Appearance is practically yellow with little to no head.  Great aftertaste, of light banana and cloves with those backing spices that give it a nice but not overpowering kick.
"
1," Light wheat-bock aroma. Bit fruity, sweet. Light hops presence. Dark caramel-red cloudy with off-white foamy lacing head. Med body & med-heavy carb. Nice belgian taste. Sweet & malty up front with wheat-yeast fruity finish. Light hops & bitter after. Very enjoyable.
"
1," 12oz - Aroma is subtle malt with a touch of nuttiness.  Pours solid brown with a huge head and good lacing.  Flavor is toasted malts with some nuttiness.  Palate is kind of sticky.  Not great, but drinkable and goes well with many of the menu items at the brew pub.
"
1," Bottle @ YNWA, Kolding.	Pours clear golden with a small, stayin, creamy, white head. Aroma has apple vinegar, some caramel malts and light grassy hops. Highish carbonation, slightly dry mouthfeel. Flavour has acid, some vinegar. Definitely infected.
"
1," On tap at the Disney World location.  Pours a brown amber with a tan lacing head.  Aroma of caramel, chocolate, toffee and sweet malts.  Flavor of caramel and cocoa.
"
1," A beer to be savoured with every sip.
"
1," Sweet aroma like maple syrup, strong alcohol. Some yeast and fruits like apple and plum.	Boysenberry in the flavour along with a pepper spice, yeast and alcohol. Very nice.
"
1," Bottled. Slightly hazy pale amber coloured. Malty aroma. Sweet and malty aroma. Rather soft.
"
1," A deep reddish color with a light tan-off white, fluffy head.  Fruity aroma, mostly of darker fruits with slight floral notes.  Medium-full bodied, lightly carbonated and smooth mouthfeel.  A slight hint of lemony hops followed by light alcohol warmth.  Sweet flavor component isnt as strong or complex as the chimay bleu.
"
1," On tap at Alt Platz.  6 oz glass, part of the edge dipped in powdered sugar and spices.  Murky chestnut brown with a beige ring of froth.  First waft is gingerbread, thence on a wonderful amalgam of Christmas and pumpkin spice luring but not revealing the complete picture.  Rich and smooth, mild carb.  Wonderful to sip and savor.  Cinnamon, ginger, cardamon, clove, mace and nutmeg are prominent.  Hints of chipotle?  A deft spice balance reminiscent of Pannepot.  But this is a pumpkin beer and rightly so.  Dont think pie think baked pumpkin, earthy and fleshy, and thats what really makes this beer shine.  An American classic.
"
1," Dark brown pour with small quickly diminishing tan head. Light carbonation. Slightly syrupy texture. Caramel, and demerera lead to dates and a butterscotch finish. Slightly thin bodied. Go for Chimay Blue or Rochefort 8.
"
1," The nose is ruled by fine Belgian yeast, and is sweet, subtle and sensuous.  Pours a nice defined one finger head.  The aste is that of well hidden alcohol, dark dried fruit and a bit of malt.  An extremely well balanced ale, that ranks in the top of its class.
"
1," SEP 12, 2008 11.2 oz. bottle pours reddish brown with little cream head. Strong aroma of alcohol and grapes. Taste is some citrius and malt clean finish. Does not taste like a 9% ABV beer. Very nice.
"
1," bottle from the Morag hostel bar in St. Augustus - Pours deep copper and smells mainly of malt.  It tastes sweet and malty with caramel and fairly minimal bitterness, particularly for an ESB.   From the looks of several other reviews, I should just be glad that my bottle wasnt infected.
"
1," 11.2oz bottle.  Poured a cloudy mahogany with a large beige head into my Chimay chalice.  I smell pepper, yeast, raisins, graham cracker, and some sour notes.  Taste was sour with some alcohol burn, and otherwise followed the aroma.  Fairly watery and very carbonated.  Kinda sorta reminds me of delirium nocturnum, but better.
"
1," Sampled at the brewpub at Walt Disney World's Boardwalk.  Corn flavor and aroma.  Much more flavorful than Bud Light.  Actually a quite decent light beer.
"
1," OCT 21, 2003 Orange appearance, fairly smooth with a bitter taste. Not true to an IPA style as its mostly just hops. No fruit flavor or complexity exists but a good beer nonetheless. It was a relief to see many people sampling this beer and much fewer people sucking down one BMC after another. Maybe there is hope for this town yet!
"
1," Pours a murky red-brown with a fizzy off-white head.  Smells of honey and fresh air, with a little peasant bread for good measure.  Nice palate with enough weight off-set by the slightest effervescense.  It pleases the tongue with nites of rosebuds, raisins, port, and honesty.  Not a strong bite, but warms in the end.  Love this stuff.  Say a prayer for the monks when you drink it and may god bless their charitable works.
"
1," Good beer from a newish cute brewery in SE, very nice aroma and bitter with some floral notes to nicely round out. Good all around.
"
1," This is indded a strong brew, but well balanced and very drinkable; fruity aroma with a malty and spicy finish; you have not drank beer until youve tried this one.

1," Nice dark brown colour, huge head. Very fruity aroma. The flavour is very pleasant, but seems less complex than other excellent Belgian trappist ales. I love the mouthfeel! The finish is medium bitter.
"
1," 12oz bottle acquired in trade atpayne (thanks!). Opened to a loud Psst. This one poured all head. Eventually settled into a dark black with red edges. Aromas of chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, and some oatmeal. Nice aromas. Tastes of bitter coffee, with light chocolate and roasted malts. As expected with the pour, the body was on the over carbonated side.
"
1," 1L growler from the brewpub, of course. Deep brown with a thick, creamy beige head. Excellent thick lace. Nutty aromas, some chocolate. Nice, smooth chocolate nut flavors (walnut?) with an even sweet maltiness. Bitter chocolate finish. Nice round body. Very nice - well done!
"
1," Pours a dirty redish brown, emphasis on the brown.  Small head with good legs.  Aroma is of malt, apples, orange peel, maybe banans, and I swear a little rye.  I think rye.  Taste is of fresh apples, wheat and then there is that rye as well just a little.  Mouthfeel is think but exceptionally smooth with a slight bitterness and sourness in the aftertaste.
"
1," Dark with a thick brown head. Very presentable. Fruity aroma, but also unpleasantly metalic. The alcohol is very present in the taste. Not the beer its cracked up to be. 	(However, after 2 years in the cellar it jumps to a rating of a little over 4 -- suddenly theres port and plums everywhere, and the metalic aroma is gone).
"
1," this is all coffee, fresh coffee and i like it.  it has a nice oily mouthfeel that i liked.  it has notes of nut and oatmeal  but it is unbalanced (i still enjoyed it).  good coffee stout.
"
1," Bottle 500ml. w. swing top @ home.Unclear medium grey amber color with a large, frothy, fair lacing, fully diminishing, off-white head. Aroma is moderate malty, grain, toasted, wet straw, light caramel, light yeasty, grain. Flavor is moderate sweet and light bitter with a average to long duration, caramel, molasses notes. Body is medium, texture is oily to watery, carbonation is soft to lively. [20101206]

1," This so far in my young life is the best beer i have ever had.  Great flavor, easy going down and no bitterness. i loved it!!
"
1," (bottle) Hazy and murky mahogany colour with yeast floaties and a mid-sized foamy tanned head, slowly lacing. Sweet dark malts aroma with caramel, chocolate and faint hoppy and spicy notes. Sweetbitter flavour, medium to full bodied, lively carbonated mouthfeel. Light sweet initial toasted malty taste with caramel; dry and slightly bitter yeasty finish with a warming and well-integrated alcoholic note and a toffee-ish aftertaste. Quaffable brew, but there are better ones out there.
"
1," Bottle.  Very nice peach/apricot malt aroma with slight hops.  Hazy orange amber with moderate head.  Pronounced malt flavor for an APA expertly blended with the piney hops.  I really enjoy this beer due to it having a much stronger malt flavor than the average APA.  Good stuff.
"
1," Poured a dark copper, almost brown, in colour.  A huge tan head filled more than half the glass (according to the label, I was using the wrong sort of glass for this one).  Some nice lacing stayed behind.  Aroma was slightly malty with a bit of hop.  Taste was amazing complex and delicious, being crisp, a bit of malt, but mostly spices and fruit.  Aftertaste was equally as nice, with perhaps a suggestion of sour cherry.
"
1," AUG 28, 2004 best of the Chimays. And surprisingly my mates liked it better than I did. Great accompanyment to meat. Tasted better after eating. Well balanced, with some sweetness and carbonation.
"
1," Tt olutta pystyy juomaan sujuvasti. Maku on paljon miedompi kuin sinisess Chimayss.
"
1," Very light, disposable beer.  Somewhat sweet front, somewhat dry finish.  Lightly grassy, quick finish, flatish palate.  One for the masses, nothing offensive, decent amount of flavor. (on tap, Rock Bottom Atlanta)
"
1," Pours almost black (but not opaque) with a medium thin light beige head. Aroma is very roasty, with a hint of dark chocolate as well. Medium to full-bodied with a strong roasted coffee flavor that weakens toward the end. There are also malt, chocolate and hops notes in the flavor. Finish is weaker than I would have liked, but this is a passable Stout.
"
1," If I may, a grand choice of a 200th beer rating, though, a shame I have not had it sooner.  11.2 oz bottle from a Chimay goblet.  Pours out a medium brownish purple, kinda ugly were it not for the gorgeous ivory rocky head that persisted/settled into a foamy cap.  Smell was right where it should be.  Overall aroma was exactly that of The Cheeky Monk Belgian Beer Cafe in Denver, CO.  Though to be more specific, it was beautifully yeasty with a primary note of blueberry, accompanying other Belgian-ish dark fruits.  Taste was fruit centric, the blueberry from the aroma coming back into play, with the standard Belgian characteristic tastes of yeast and a touch of malt.  A whisper of Christmas-like spice, sweet but not cloying, warm yet not too powerful on the alcohol.  Finely carbonated behind a silky smooth texture. A pleasant and outstanding beer.
"
1," Draft.  Very dark amber with a nice light head.  Rich tones of hops and a nice malted scent to it.  Clean, sweet finish and a very drinkable beer.  They should bottle this stuff.
"
1," 330 ml bottle about 6 mos old. Medium brown and not hazy like the red cap I had. Aroma was af mild malt,mild chocolate and watered down dark fruit. 	Flavor was pretty much the same with a fizzy mouthfeel. Pretty good but Ive had much better. Needs to age. Buy this and wait til you have grand kids to pop it open.
"
1," This is an excellent beer, with an explosion of flavors.  Very pleasing to the palate.
"
1," Dark cherry and chocolate nose.  The pour is brown with a light brown head.  The start is slightly bitter with a strong roasted malt finish.  Quite a full complex body.
"
1," From the 750ml bottle. I have had this many times, but when I decided to rate it, it turned out to be amazingly disappointing. Nothing was wrong with the bottle or its age, but this was not an interesting beer. Too young, maybe? Weak, somewhat vegetal aroma. Light body and light flavor, with not near enough malt. Very boring.
"
1," Small irregular head. Very sticky to the glass. Rather neutral smell with only a small amount of spices. Malty sweetness with some spices. Light body. Medium carbonation. Medium aftertaste. Not my favourite trappist.
"
1," Bottle 50 cl. Courtesy of fonefan. Pours an orangey brown with a slight haze and a dense off-white head. Sweet and intense banana nose. Medium body, banana and heavy licorice notes. A whiff of butter and phenols. Ends dry. 151010
"
1," Pours deep chestnut brown, Hazy with a tall beage head. Aroma is very bready and yeasty with notes of Dark fruits. Flavour is very malty, mild notes of fruit and bread. Very nice hoppy finish, and not overly complex, but a real treat to drink. And at 7% I could drink this everyday!
"
1," JUN 22, 2008 [Vintage 2003, tasted 2008]. I am totally convinced that there was a major decline in Chimay Bleu between 2003 and and 2004. The 2003 vintage is amazing today - almost as good as Westvleteren 12, but the 2004 and forward are weak.		The 2003 pours a brown ale with a low head. It has an amazing strong aroma of plume, walnuts, caramel, spice, madeira, port and liquorice. The flavours are all spicy, vineous and well combined. Too bad I dont have more left of this amazing year in the cellar. [The rating is based on the 2003-vintage]
"
1," Oh Chimay, how I love you.  Despite widespread distribution, Chimay Blue still really takes the cake for most delicious beer.  There is enough alcohol to get you going and the high carbonation combined with taste of prickly spices is perfect for my carbonation-biased palate.  The true test of Chimays staying power, though, is that it is the only beer that make sure is always stocked in my house.
"
1," This tastes exactly like it would taste if an ale had cinnamon and some other spices thrown into it. There is just no jiving together of this stuff, its way out of balance. Certainly a poor attempt at a Christmas ale, but then again, we did manage to finish the bottle!
"
1," From the tap, served in a standard bar pint glass.		Poured a creamy black with frothy, fluffy, foamy tan head that settled into a thin creamy lacing, minimal amount of sticking.		Aromas of earthy dark roasted coffee, hints of fruitiness and a lactose sweet oatmeal.		Good, even moderate carbonation and a softly crisp, slick, a airy creamy smooth medium bodied mouthfeel.		A nice coffee stout taste, earthy, dry, dark roast coffee, nutty yeast, a sweet lactic, creamy taste from the oatmeal, a very soft bitterness towards the end and a dryish, nutty coffee, oatmeal finish.		Very fresh tasting from the tap, an easy, smooth drinkability, sampled at the introductory party for Barley Island in Peoria.
"
1," dark brown pour with a thin tan head.	aroma is very sweet. definitely get raisin and brown sugar. chocolate. hint of the red wine.	More pronounced vinous tones in the flavour. Not as sweet as I suspected. 	some bitter chocolate, rather dry. roasted maltiness.  Bit raw in the finish.
"
1," Pours a hazy brown/maroon with a medium light tan head.  Smells of sweet, dark fruits, candy sugar, and caramel malts.  Medium-bodied, balanced really well.  Fruitier more than it is malty, very sweet with a good dose of candy sugar left on the palate.  Very solid dubbel, I liked the fact that it didnt have anything more overpowering than another.  Good balance.
"
1," Pours beautiful hazy plum with frothy two finger head. Nose of sweet malt and dark fruit. Flavors are incredible- lingering sweetness from residual sugar, powerful malt, and excellently masked alcohol. Mouthfeel is smooth, rich, chewy, and lingering. Simply incredible- this is hard to beat.
"
1," On tap at the Springfield, PA location. Poured a lighter golden color with a very small, if any head. Aromas and tastes of grain, very lightly fruity with a light grassy finish. Lively yet thin and watery body. Oh yeah, the person seating me told me this was a new one and was a Pale Ale even though the menu he gave me listed it as a lighter beer brewed in the Kolsh style.
"
1," Bottle poured into Chimays own glass.  Pours deep reddish brown with a thick offwhite head.  Smells similar to the other Chimay brews.. slightly more aromatic.  Velvet smooth finish.. as is typical.  A great beer.
"
1," Nice subtle sweet aroma, dark brown color and thick dense head.  Nice rich dark taste, smooth light malt taste with a nice sweet finish.  Absolutely delicious!
"
1," They must have really reworked this one since BBBMike last had it!  Very hoppy nose from a nice light amber color.  Malty at first sip, medium body.  I went back for a few more smaples to make sure that I was really tasting a wonderfully balanced pale with loads of caramel and even some fruity pale malt hints. Hoppy presence at finish is quite enjoyable. Long tasty finish.
"
1," Dark tan, hazy appearance in glass. Aroma of bread, yeast, slightly floral. Taste of bready yeast, sweet caramel,  raisin, complex malt character, bit of spicy floral hop - well balanced, the 9% abv well masked- just enough alcohol to contribute to the taste. Luxuriant feel in mouth. Smooth. Finish quite rapid, warming pleasant transient spicy alcohol tang.	I like this one!

1," Bire exceptionnelle jai rarement bu une bire brune dun arome aussi agrable , son petit gout sucr lui donne un gout extraordinaire
"
1," JAN 18, 2007 Pours a dark cloudy reddish amber color with an frothy tan head. Nose is spicy Belgian yeast with a hint of apricot.  Flavor starts with a mild sweet malt followed by some Belgian  spice with a touch of tartness. Finish is somewhat dry. Light body, creamy texture with lively carbonation.
"
1," Full bodied beer with a strong blend of malts and chocolate.  Pours pitch black and it great alone or with a meal.  Finishes smooth.
"
1," Very amber pour.....sweet, fruity hints on the nose. Very sweet flavor....plums, raisins, caramel malts. A great beer to sip slightly below room temperature.
"
1," MAR 30, 2008 I really like this one. Nice deep amber color with a tan head. Hints of spice and fruit in the aroma. There is a good bit of carbonation. There are nice hints of fruit in the flavor and no alcohol taste. Very smooth.
"
1," A good beer.  Not quite what I expected after having read about it for the last 6 months in the forum and finally tasting it.  Fruitier than expected.  A very pronouned fruity scent with a hint of orange?  Very nice after taste feeling on the tongue.  Havent had many beers of this style but I can definently see myself becoming a fan.
"
1," 12 ounce bottle from Whole Foods Market Indianapolis. Pours a hazy golden with an explosive head. Not a gusher from the bottle thankfully but the rocky white head is so huge this is taking forever to pour. Aroma of bread, spice, butter, corn. The taste is almost champagne-like... grapes, apples, bread, spices. Tart finish. Doesnt smell great and annoying as heck, but Im actually liking the taste.
"
1," Pours dark cherry brown with tiny bubbles, big nose of sweet fruit and yeast. Malty and very tasty, yummy...although a bit of metallic flavor on the aftertaste.
"
1," I actually like this better than the bleu.  Alcohol is less prevalent, both in taste and aroma, allowing a more fruity, maltiness to shine through.  Beautiful brown, muddy appearance, with a creamy white head.  Unfortunately, carbonation robs this beer of the smoothness that would make it near perfect. Regardless, this is a great beer.
"
1," A fine beer. Not superb. Many peaple would like it.
"
1," At Cafe Bar Le Duc s Hertogenbosch (NL). A hazy red/brown colored beer, with a medium beige head. The aroma is light caramel and malty. also a little fruit. The taste is bitter/sweet, caramel. A little of serveral taste like toffee, coffee and dark fruits. The aftertaste is nice and soft.
"
1," i like this one more than the blue now.  seems to me more versatile and drinkable.  the ultimate belgian brown/dubbel ale for me.  tastes best room temp, though not as refreshing.  and for whatever reason, always tastes better in the big bottles.   yay!
"
1," Draft at BI - Aroma is clean and appealing.  Belgian yeast, bubblegum, chocolate and pungent spice.  Pours dark garnet with a ring head and great lacing.  Flavor is strong and tasty, matches aroma with some caramel added in for good measure.  Oily palate with a full lingering mouthfeel.  A very nice brew.
"
1," JUL 9, 2007 Initially didnt care for this one but now I can appreciate its qualities. Unfortunately, a tad to malty, yeasty and raisiny for my taste. Yet still a very solid ale that gets better as it warms up. Big points for the one finger head that never went away along with the tiny bubbles that continued to rise to the top.
"
1," Pours opaque and brown, tan head slightly lighter than the blue. Aroma is nutty and spicy (cinnamon, allspice), caramel and yeast - but less dark, rich malts than the blue. Flavor is sweet and spicy with pungent yeast and a light warming finish. Medium body with lively carbonation and a complex but slightly restrained finish. Excellent dubbel.
"
1," I was expecting a lot from this beer but was dissapointed.Althought it wasnt a poor drink it just wasnt as interesting as I thought it would be.Light brown appearance and a pleasant texture without the obvious alchohol impact you would expect from a beer of this strength. There was  no complexity and nothing to say that this was a highly thought of Abbey beer.Still theres always the blue and the white left to try.
"
1," Really subtle, classy, well-made stuff. Compex aroma, yeast, but not overpowering. Spicy, tart fruit flavor. Wonderful.
"
1," Bottle. Fruity, malty aroma. Toffee to begin with. When this beer warms a synthetic, plastic aroma and taste develop. This was a little unpleasant, almost stopped me from finishing my glass.
"
1," Served up a dark brown, near black body crowned with a half inch-high layer of beige foam.		Smell"
1," (12oz bottle thanks to Cavie) clear amber, effervescent in the glass, ring of off-white head. Nose is very sweet, oddly a bit tart, and raw grain. Taste is also a bit tart, orange, lacking in flavor overall, but some buttery components here also. Thin body and thin on palate flavor, well carbonated though.
"
1," Bottle from Csakajosor.hu. Poured golden yellow with a nice, quick to disappear white head. Aroma of honey, vanilla, grapes, apple, coriander, cinnamon, and yeast. Somewhat musty. Medium dense with lots of carbonation. Sweet, caramelish taste, pleasant, somewhat dry, vinous finish. Really good!
"
1," Rica cerveza de abadia (fermentada en la botella) con ligero sabor afrutado.
"
1," From a 12 oz. bottle with no freshness date, sampled at cellar temperature in a pint glass, without, then with the recommended slice of lemon.		Poured a clear pale yellowish golden with a foamy white head, decent retention, slowly settled into a thin sudsy lacing.		The aroma without the lemon slice was very wheat malty, a light spiciness and a subtle fruitiness, with lemon slice, lemony, of course, the yeast comes out a bit, and the malts turn a little fruit wheat bready, kinda of appealing.		Good carbonation, tiny micro bubbles flowing from bottom to top for the whole duration, and a soft malty crisp, dry, creamy smooth medium-light bodied mouthfeel, when add the lemon slice it helps the crispiness and adds a little acidity.		The taste without the lemon slice, wheat malty with a mildly tart peach fruitiness, a touch of spiciness, with the slice of lemon, lemon fruity with a mild citric acidity, the malts turn wheat bready with a soft spiciness, the mild tart peach fruitiness is tamed even more, and a dry lemony, fruity, bready finish. The slice of lemon adds to the taste and I see why the brewer recommends it, an easy, smooth drinker on a hot, muggy late spring day.		I would just like to add that I dont think it is a ""crime"" or ""sin"" to a add a slice of lemon or orange to a pale wheat ale or witbier, especially when that is the brewers intent.
"
1," My own personal opnion about this beer is that it has to be one of the best wines I mean beers I have ever tasted. I have read some of the other posts and have come to the conclusion that every bottle must be different. The bottle I tryed had a strong fruit aroma. The flavor was increadible, somewhat sweet and fruity. I could tell that there was a higher than average alcohol %, but it was on the level of a red wine. I will highly recommend this beer to all drinkers.
"
1," Bottle, I am fond of all the Trappist beers so it it not hard to give a good rating.  A well rounded balanced beer .
"
1," Malt sweetness starts with spicy hops.  Slight esters.  Deep amber with beige head.  Bready, caramel malt starts; malt presence continues and hop flavor/bitterness arrives late.  Finish is crisp.  Medium body with crisp bite.  Good example of a red; hops are a bit subdued for a malt-forward ale.

1," Back around 20+ years ago when I first discovered this I thought it was godly. Have not had it in a few years. WHAT the hell happened?!	 330 ml bottle about 6 mos old. Slightly hazy copper color. Aroma was light fruit and yeast. Flavor was not much differant. Had a hint of spice in the tale end of the finish. Mouthfeel was a bit watery. Highly quaffable tho unremarkable. Not like it used to be.
"
1," JAN 18, 2009 courtesy of Toni Flkiger - hazy orange colour with no foam left; aroma of cider, old apple and candi sugar; medium-bodied and slightly acidic, moderate carbonation, short and quite dry acidic finish of apple and herbs - not sure if it is supposed to taste like this ...
"
1," 750ml - Pungent aroma of Belgian yeast, candi sugar, raisin, cocoa, and some tasty smelling spices. Pours a deep mahagony with a small head and good lacing. Flavor matches aroma with the alcohol showing up, but not in ""hot"" way. Palate is sticky and sweet. Carbonated mouthfeel helps keep each drink fresh. A wonderfully drinkable Belgian strong.  		I look at scores and wonder what it takes for you beer geeks.  This is as perfect a beer you can get for the style.

1," (Deleted and re-rated). 750ml corked bottle, 2007. Pops explosively open with a waft of black cherry fruit, blood, apple yeastiness, a sniff of roasted malt, raisin, ALCOHOL. A promising start. Forms a gushing tan head in the bottle but dies instantly in the glass. The thinness and booze-drenched finesse of McChouffe or Kasteel Bruin, minus a few tablespoons of sugar. Way too much marzipan (alcohol) for me, with no depth of character to back it up. Totally embarassed by its Trappist brothers (Westmalle Dubbel, Westies, Rocheforts). This is more a watery Scotch ale or barley wine than it is a fat, hallucinatory monastic bruiser. Seriously disappointing, and not for the first time. I could brew better in my shed.                                       	(original rate)...Porterish black-brown topped with a creamy beige. Sillky mouthfeel. Apple and caramel opening up in the nose as it warms. But an oddly underwhelming and flavourless ale for the ABV. Dour and sugary with an unsubtle waft of spiritous booze and a fairly caustic bitterness in the finish. No spice, no roastiness, certainly no hops (extract). Anonymous milky maltiness that looks, smells and feels far more interesting than it tastes (6/4/4/4/11/2.9)
"
1," Golden, slowly diminishing hige off-white head; bananas, cloves and a touch of nut-meg in the nose; moderate sweet-sourish flavour, fizzy MF, light to medium bodied; vegetables in the light sourish-fruity finish. Not really convincing......
"
1," MAR 9, 2007 Beautifull dark red appearance. More hobby and flowery than fruity. Plesant sparkling smooth palate. Sweetbitter flavor of toffee and hobs. Id prefer Chimay Blue but definetly enjoy this one too
"
1," Dark brown with a nice head. The aroma has notes of roasted malt and grain. The flavour has sweetness, notes of roasted malt, caramel, wet grain and the finish has a slightly dry and light bitterness.
"
1," A vey nice beer, far out strips 98% of beers for taste, aroma and impression.  Cant rate it as high as the Bleu because it is the best of the Stable
"
1, Slightly hazy brown with a medium sized beige head 	Aroma
1," Huge (HUGE) light tan head, lightish dark brown body. Yeasty cheese citrus aroma. Blah... infection is covering it up. Thin body. Trying to rate based on my preinfection perspective, but also noting to log the infection in the rating. Dry lactose blahness.
"
1," This beer pours with a good beige head and shows excellent lacing. There was a definate aroma of cherries (raisined?) and the smooth body was very complex and rich. I am very tempted to cellar a larger bottle as I have read this will further enhance the port flavours.
"
1," Ahh chimay - the biere that introduced us to trappistisme. Cant believe Im finally getting around to rating this guy. Pours a lighter shade of dark brown. Less head than I remember. A great balance of fruitiness and dark sugars ensues. Well done.
"
1," Glowing orange color with huge off white head. Fresh hoppy aroma. The taste was the same. Smooth on the palate. Massive lacing.
"
1," A good beer, all aspects are above average. Overhyped for sure, but still really good.
"
1," Dark ruby black pour with a light brown head.  Aroma was raisins, pennies, dark fruit and vinegar.  Flavor was almost nothing but oxidization and pennies.  I think this beer had tremendous potential and was done a great disservice by being put into twist off bottles.  Give me a cage and cork bottle of this to sit on for a few years and it has great potential to be exciting.
"
1," This bottled brew from Indianapolis poured a small sized head of fine to medium sized foamy with a frothy top tan colored mostly lasting bubbles that left behind a transparent but very dark brown colored typically carbonated body.  The aroma was of mile brown and dark  malts.  The mouth feel was tingly from start to finish.  The flavor contained notes of dark malts and hops.
"
1," Its golden with a creamy, white head, and the aroma has notes of malt, flower, biscuits and hay. The flavour has a light sweetness and notes of malt, flower, light citrus, hay, biscuit and the finish is slightly dry with a slightly harsh bitterness.
"
1," 12oz bottle pours a clear orange with a white film of a head. Aroma of corn, grain, caramel, and a slight sourness and hop. Taste has some up front malty sweetness that turns into bitter yeast flavors, with hints of hops throughout. Interesting and very decent Lager.
"
1," A deep dark murky brown brew with tan head and carbonation. Aromas and flavors of dark fruit, raisins, earthy tones. Lots of yeasty flavors. Somewhat bittering finish. Heavy body and abv is well masked. Some sweetness. Really a legendary brew among brews!
"
1," The instant the bottle is opened a strong yeast smell is unleashed, although it is not overpowering. Chimay Blue pours a dark amber color, with a light brown head. The head is retained for a fairly long time but eventually fades to a ring. It is very subtle on the palate with an initial yeast taste, but quickly fades to a light, fruity, almost flowery flavor. This aftertaste is all thats left after each wonderful sip.
"
1," Pours an opaque brown, with a nice foamy tan head, speckles of sediment float in the glass. Aroma isnt really anything special. A little nutty, a little malty. Flavor hm. A bit of caramel flavor....around a roasty, nutty flavor. Flowing over my tongue, I also taste a bit of dark fruit....plum or grape. Overall, very good. I prefer the Rochefort 10 though.
"
1," Undoubtable the finest beer brewed in the world.		Eric Kirchhoefer	St. Louis, MO
"
1," The aroma is a combination of spices, hops, and fruit.  The pour is a murky brown with a tan head.  The spiceness of the hops accompanied by a dry fruitiness is well balanced.
"
1," The pour was most interesting, it kept foaming out of the 750 ml. bottle. I only wanted to try a few sips! Medium brown color with large but dissipitating head. Good smell with spice and some fruit, which did not disapoint in the tasting. Semi-dry aftertaste.
"
1," Golden yellow color, very cloudy with many small yeast particles. The smell is hoppy and yeasty, slightly sour. Starts hoppy, with a slightly yeasty-sharp aroma in the further course. The finish shows yeasty fruity, slightly citrus-sour.
"
1," Sampled at Japanese Pavilion at Epcot. Pours clear. Dry, grainy aroma with a touch of melon. Taste is very dry with rice, vanilla and melon all popping up.
"
1," Very nice and balanced. Dark amber with a medium, frothy, tan-colored head. The aroma suggests notes of fruit cake, malts, caramel, and a bit of yeasty citrus. The taste is sweet and bitter, but not overdone either way. The mouthfeel is solid and assertive, with vigorous carbonation and a medium body. Very, very nice.
"
1,"  Faint aroma of roasting and yeast.  Poured dark brown with a hint of red and a large, foamy, dense, tan head that lasted throughout.  Very sparkling.  Lots of large particles.  Lightly sweet flavor.  Tastes of fruits, dark fruits, nutmeg, and a little roasting.  Medium body.  Smooth, creamy texture.  Average to lively carbonation.  Malty, dark fruit finish.  Overall, not as good as its reputation.
"
1," APR 3, 2009 2008 re-rate. The dark brown colour and firm white head makes it look very attractive.	Aroma of dried fruit, some banana and a hint of metal. Dry with a fruity sweetness, a touch of licorice and spicy complexity. Big and creamy mouthfeel.
"
1," This is one of my favorite Trappist beers! it has some nice floral hop notes with some citrus hints a nice light head with some dry fruitiness and some chocolate and coffee and a hint of earthiness...
"
1," Hazy dark golden pour topped by a small, but eternal and lacy white head. A nice case of beauty in simplicity here. An english pale ale with no watery edges at all. Medium-full bodied even, yet with an engaging carbonation. Clean and tasty cerealic ale. Hops do procure a minimal bitterness, clearly serving a support role, but still enhancing the freshness feel. Slightly sulphury, heavily bready foundations still impart a medium-high sweetness level for a brewpubs most accessible beer. A fun mouthful of easy-drinking cereals.
"
1," Bottle (22 oz).  Bourbon and oatmeal raisin cookie aroma.  Midnight black with a thin tan head.  Chocolate and oat malt flavor with just a hint of bourbon.  Much lighter body than expected.  Nice taste but pretty light.
"
1," On tap at the brewery in Nashville. Very turbid dark brown color. Very sweet, nutty aroma. Taste is on the sweeter side - crystal malts, some chocolate, and nutty overtones. Quite good.
"
1," Bottle poured into my Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale snifter.	Pours a very dark brown. There is no head to speak of. Only a little froth ring around the perimeter of the glass.	Not a whole lot in the nose. But what you do get is some roasty coffee flavor.	Taste is roasted coffee in your face! Some good roasted/burnt coffee flavors going on here. Not getting alot of other flavors than the coffee. However, the coffee used seems to be decent so it works for me.	Mouthfeel is medium and pretty carbonated. Decent for a stout. This is a good java stout. Not over the top. Just an all around well made beer.
"
1," Now this is a stout!  Heavy, black, sweet.  Aroma of roasted malt, vanilla, chocolate, coffee.  Taste is dark malt with some hops thrown in for tempering.
"
1," Bottle 11.2 oz.  A dark tawny, brown opaque, hue.  Mild aroma which hints at the mild taste of malt and caramel with only a touch of hops.  Medium body, that does in fact, ""impart a silky senasation to the tongue,"" but with a lot of carbonation.  Well balanced, pleasant, and excellent.  Too mild for my tastes but very easy to drink and enjoy.
"
1," Medium amber body with an off white head. The aroma is oranges with some almonds and toast. This is typical for an APA smell. The taste is soapy with some piney resin and grapefruit. There is no malt background to balance out this bitterness. The body is sticky with a fairly full mouthfeel for the abv. I am not impressed with this one.
"
1," Pours a clear medium amber. Aroma is floral and soap. Definitely soap. Taste is floral hops with little malt and that soapy taste. Sharp bitterness provides more bite than I expect from an APA. Mouthfeel is average. Not very drinkable at all.		I had this beer a few months ago and it was much much better. Looking at the scores on here, they seem to be all over the place. My assumption would be that Barley Island has some serious quality control issues and are sending out batches that vary wildly from batch to batch. I really liked the last one I had (hence buying more), but would never buy THIS product again.
"
1," This is one of the better belgium beers that I have tried. Massive off white head which diminished quickly, not a full aroma (butterscotch?), good blend of flavours too numerous to list.
"
1," Pours dark brown  with a light brown head.  Nose has milk chocolate and cocoa powder with a bit of vanilla.  Chocolatey flavor with a herbal hop finish.  Maybe just a bit of barrel character but not much at all.  Full body and a dry finish.  Not bad.
"
1," bottlle into glass.  Beautiful red color in glass with nice head and lacing.  Delicous aroma of peaches almost too ripe.  The aroma and flavor became more intense as the beer sat for about 10 minutes in the glass. Alcohol seems to be hidden a little better in this beer than in the white. Great beer.
"
1," Good things come to those who wait.  Purchased from Trader Joes at least a year ago. Pours a dark brown with amber orange glow and thin white head. First sip is  alcohol, berries, malt, and anise then fade to brown sugar and cinnamon bread and banana. I had no idea Chimay could be this good and complex.  Definitely worth the wait.
"
1," APR 28, 2003 (Bottle) Pours a thin white head and a beautiful dark red body. Floral aroma with spice, raisins and heightened alcohol. Flavours of roasted coffee and spice. Very dry finish with slight alcohol burn. Excellent!
"
1," Draft at Chattanooga Downtown location. Pale in the glass with a creamy white head that left a thin layer lasting and light lace. Bready aroma with some light spice. Biscuit flavor with hints of lemon and spice. Light body, crisp, tingly carbonation.
"
1," The cork is labeled 07/04.  Pours to a deep red brown color with a medium fizzy beige head.  The head all but disapates but doesnt because of a constant and rapid stream of bubbles.  The lacing is so-so.  The aroma is huge.  Yeasty, roses, flowers, buttered dark fruits, cloves.  The flavor is quite nice.  Dark fruits, minerals, pepper, spices, cloves.  The palate is too carbonated.  Very burning on the tongue.  Medium bodied.  Not the best BSA Ive had, but still quite good.
"
1," Tasted at the 2007 Beer Festival in Edinburgh Scotland. Deep Ruby.  Predominantly malty with robust hops.  Definitely will look out for this one.
"
1," 12 oz bottle acquired in trade w/Acknud. Pours a golden color with a drop of red. Minimal white head with lace that immediately disappears. Malt and citrus aroma. Moderate mouthfeel. Hops kind of dominate throughout. Almost IPA like. Slight citrus taste. Hops really dominate the finish with a slight bitterness. A good session ale.
"
1," lemon, wheat, nutmeg, spice, and some grainy flavors.  very very decent but too thin and too weak for any recognizable difference
"
1," Bottle. Hazy amber colour with a huge moslty lasting creamy head. Rich aroma and taste of yeast and malts with fruity notes.
"
1," Pours a nice copper color with a lasting head.  Quite carbonated and lively.  Fruity, spicy aroma and flavor.  Well-balanced between malt and hops.  Overall, an excellent beer and one worth savoring.
"
1," 750ml. cork says 2006. hazy reddish brown...almost the color of the bottle. aromas of chocolate, bread grain, citrus and metallic malts. flavor is caramel, earth, yeast, cocoa and something citrusy. medium mouth feel with high carbonation. dry, lightly bitter finish with a raisin/chardonnay like aftertaste.
"
1," MAR 31, 2005 pours a ruby colour with a moderate lasting head. Apricot and Plums in the nose. easy on the palate, refreshing finish, i really enjoyed this.
"
1," Light tan, some haze.  Sweetish palate. Tastes a little like corn syrup although Id be quite disappointed if this small micro actually used any.  Goldings or Willamettes in evidence.  Flavours are herbal, with mushrooms (finding those in damn near everything all of a sudden), hedges and early morning farmers fields.  Look at me trying to find new ways of describing a beer Ive essentially had four dozen times before.  What can I say, the beer is so boring I need to make my own fun.  Imagine what I can come up with when I finally have Rickards Honey Brown...tastes like watching two fat elderly people get it on...no I can do better than that...tastes like watching your dog lick his own balls...something like that anyway.
"
1," bottle. Cloudy yellow, large white head. Fruity nose. Wheaty and yeasty with shy hints of banana. Full-bodied and warming.
"
1," 11.2 oz. bottle poured smooth with fast dissipating head.  Very smooth with noticeable yeast.  Medium to lighter bodied and easy to drink.  Exceptionally well put together.  Highly Recommended.
"
1," Bottle, shared with me by Parksy after I helped him move 3 bookcases, one eliptical trainer (fuuucck), and one re-upholstered-but-still-ugly chair down the street to Dodos and Daves. ... and it was totally WORTH IT!!! Light bright orange amber, thick lasting head that generates fine early lace. Aroma is beautiful hoppy citrus and tropical fruit. Just a fresh full-on hop blast. Juicy hoppy palate, with lots of fresh citrus, some passionfruit, and resinous pine that becomes more apparent in the long bitter finish. In a blind taste test I would never in a million years would have guessed this to come from Dead Frog-- super well-done, and their best offering by a long shot. Really excellent.
"
1," Bottle to snifter. Hazy amber pour leaving a soapy white head that fades and shows minimal lacing. Aroma is pine hops that are somewhat pungent and a soft malt scent, but mainly hops. Taste is bitter pine and a little oily and a malty dirty finish with the hops lingering. Palate is medium and gritty with a chaulky finish. Theres something good going on here, but I cant put my finger on it.

1," (12oz bottle)  Pours a dark brown body with a medium brown head.  Aroma of chocolate, roastiness, molasses, vanilla, and light bourbon.  Flavor of chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, and light vanilla.

1," (Bottle) Pours a brown color with a small off-white head. Light aroma of Belgian yeast. Tastes include sugar, and some dried dark fruits. Light spice as well. Slight alcohol warming in the finish. Good palate as well. A pretty good brew.

1," JAN 3, 2009 old rating"
1," Great little bottle. Appearance is amberred with a dull head. First sip reveals a heavy aroma of honey and sugar turning refreshingely bitter.	Great for caf talks and a sturdy meat meal.
"
1," Typical alcoholly flavor of a strong ale. Chimay is the standard that others are compared to! Fairly rocky head, but it didnt last nearly as long as I rememberd in the past. Nice orangey-brown color. The aroma that came out of the bottle when I first uncapped it was wonderful scent of fresh yeast. From the glass it was more muted, but that could be due to the lingering cold I have.
"
1, It was poured from a stubby brown 11.2oz bottle into a signature Chimay chalice that came with the gift set.		Appearance
1," 12 oz bottle. Cola brown pour with a tan head. Aroma of roasted malt and a subtle hint of bourbon. Roasted malt, chocolate,and slight bourbon. Some sweetness at the end. Laces well.
"
1," i wonder if some folks are getting hold of mis-treated bottles.  just finishing a 750ml.  very nice color, with a little purple tint to it, terrific pour into my chimay goblet.  smooth taste and finish.  cant really pick up the alcohol, but i know its there.  good stuff, this.
"
1," AUG 10, 2008 One of my favorite Belgians. Pours a deep copper/brown with a malty nose with some sweet dried fruit influences that carry into the taste, which has a complex flavor, and is supported beautifully by the aroma.
"
1," This copper ale poured with a typical fluffy Chimay head. There is a nice blend of malt and hops, resulting in a pleasant fruity flavor that is enhanced by the superior Chimay yeast. More bitter and less body than the Blue label.
"
1," I am in love with this beer.	I love Tripel. And La Blanche is a Tripel among Tripels, for sure.	Try as I might, I could find no fault with this brew -- much like Mary Poppins, it is Practically Perfect in Every Way.  My current favorite aspect is the nose/aroma -- I would be content to sit and smell the glass for an afternoon. Its that hint of springtime rhododendron/azalea blooms that sends me over the edge.  	And the palate/mouthfeel -- cest orgasmique.
"
1," Bottle; aroma of dark fruit, candy sugar and caramel.  Good aroma.  Poured a brownish red color.  Noticable carbonation; dry finish, slightly astringent.  Subtle, but good and complex flavors.  Fruit, caramel, some yeast and caramel.  The Chimay beers are what helped me get into better beers; still prefer the blue.
"
1," Cloudy brown with very little head. Mildly spicy & fruity. Finishes dry with little bit of sourness.  Just a bit of hops too.  Very balanced and flavorful - a must try.
"
1," On tap at Barley island in BR.  Nose is full of hops with noticable sweetness. Pours dark brown with a pale and fading head. Has the initial bite of an ipa but immediately mellows out in to a smooth cream like taste and feel. Very nice and quite different.
"
1," Amber with off white head.Nice malt profile with some decent hops in the finish.
"
1," Very nice color and smells so sweet.  Very nice blance taste.  I have found the Chimay bleu to be my favorite.
"
1," 22oz bottle from ATPayne. First off, I would love to try this side by side with a non BA version. Since I cant, I will simply give a description of this version. Pours a nice black color with a foamy brown head. Seems very fizzy and carbonated. Nose is mainly bourbon with a slight bit of chocolate seeping through. Flavor is all bourbon, a little bit woody and some more bourbon. Lacking here, nothing good happening and the bourbon has taken this beer hostage. No solid stout characteristics remain and its like drinking a carbonated glass of watered down bourbon. BA is not always successful.
"
1," DEC 1, 2003 Re-rate.  This is much better than I remember it being.  Aroma is spicy/yeasty, not increibly complex, but attractive.  Appearance is nice light brown with off white head that is retained.  Flavor is quite nice also, full flavor exhibiting an awesome yeast strain, mild notes of dried fruit, some maltiness, and a dry bitter finish.  Very good and I repent of my prior rants against Chimay.
"
1," This beer has a brown body - hue apperance and a coarse light brown scum collar. I have drunk the beer from the bottle and it had a lot of carbonic acid. The initial flavor taste is sweet with a sweet afther tast.
"
1," Der hellmalzige und hefige Antrunk ist stark karbonisiert und leitet schnell in den intensiveren Mittelteil ber. Dieser ist deutlich hefiger und malziger, dazu mild bananig. Das Bier hat hier einen weichen Krper, die Aromen sind im Gesamten trotz ihrer in Intensitt cremig. Zum Ende wird der Alkohol ersichtlicher, die Bananigkeit nimmt zu. Ein netter und erfrischender Weizenbock. 9/12/12/12/11/12
"
1," The Dan Journal #431. Tasted 12/14/10. 12oz bottle. Hazy and sedimented with a dark amber hue. Spotty bubbled tan head. Aromas of citrus hops and toasty malts. Medium bodied with a pleasant grapefruit hop bitterness. Solid citrus flavors and it adds to the effervescence. Subtle raisin note. Decent enough.
"
1," Copper red color. Creamy frothy head with a network of lace. Caramel toffee nose, with hints of fruit ie. apricot, banana, and I think I smell papaya. Taste starts out similar to the nose, and ends with a subtle astringently bitter floral finish. Very nice.
"
1," Large bottle. By far the best out of the red/white and blue chimays. Brown pour with a small off white head. Sweet aroma with belgian spices. Sweet malt/ citrus taste but blended rather well. Good job !
"
1," Slightly hazed golden color with a moderate off white head. Some lace. Toasted bread, mild herb and grass and some fresh pizza dough thrown in the aroma mix. Fairly thin in feel. Mild toasted malt flavors, mingle with dusty floral hops. Has a vienna flavor to it. A bit to sweet.
"
1," Bottle- Pours dark brown body with hints of rouge. Thick foamy beige head accompanies. Aromas of sweet caramel malts, bitterness from hops, earthy, slight alcohol. Very complex smelling, and tempting. Taste of sweet malt, slight sourness and alcohol. Bitter with some nuttiness. A lot of flavours present, but none are too distinct. A little bit of everything. Yeasty on the aftertaste, sweetness lingers slightly. Strong alcohol content that is hardly noticed. Very good!
"
1," Bottle. Very thick head with chocolate dominating the aroma with a sweetness of syrup? Not as bold as I thought it was going to be from the smell. Still very rich and creamy. Wonderful after taste.  Sweet but well balanced. =)
"
1," Bottle 0,33 l, A deep golden moisty colour with a nice white long-lasting head. A fruity and bitter taste with strong hints of hops and alcohol that is not too much. A keen and dry finish dominated by notes of alcohol and walnuts. A fantastic ""every-day"" beer

1," Cask Stillage from the Jug at the GABF, Colorado Convention Center 26/09/2009	Floral hop aroma. Bronze coloured and hoppy with a little dryness and bitterness in a crisp malt finish.
"
1," JAN 17, 2008 Pours with a thick, off white head.  Deep brown in color.  Tastes of toffee and roasted malt.  Nice smooth mouthfeel.  Very subtle hopping at the finish.   11.2oz bottle.  Deep brown colored, slight haze.  Nice and compact khaki/tan head forms.  Pleasant aroma, sweetish, some cola qualities slight bits of darker pit fruits.  Well carbonated, quite active on the palate.  Sweetish taste, light hop balance on finish.  Again dark pit fruit flavors.  Quite decent.
"
1," dont flame me but can someone tell me why this is so highly rated?..pours a fine colour, wonderful hazy copper but not much in the way of a head on it, fizzes away quite quickly. fizz is the best way i can find to describe the beer too...tastes to me like a 1.86 (from asda) glass of coca cola.....very sweet and to me extremely carbonated...fizzes on the tongue and finishes long but nothing to distinguish it really...mind it was a 2007 bottle so maybe it needs more age in the bottle
"
1," Wow.  Intense.  Full flavored.  Alcohol jump start.  A flavor explosion.  Wow again.
"
1," Bread pale malt honey malt grass pepper dough light citrus. Interesting but a little disjointed. Golden light hazy thin ring of foam. Dough pale malt sweetness bread peppery dry bitterness sweet grass and a little citrus. Maybe too oddly hoppy for style. Well carbonated. Interesting take on style.
"
1," Color is muddled amber, more malt than hop but balance is there...light carmel malt..mild brown sugar nose...some vegetal spice..sip it or glug it...its flexible
"
1," Tasted from a 500 mL bottle purchased in Aurora, Colorado.  Pretty clear light pale appearance with a light head.  Light lager aroma.  Pretty bland pale lager thats not that bitter but does have a slightly bitter finish.
"
1," I love Chimay! Although Blue is my favorite, both the Red and the White are delicious. The Red had lots of carbonation and great flavor. Just a great beer.
"
1," Ok stout, creamy tan head, uncarbonated, opaque black body, coffee nose and flavor, smooth with good lacing
"
1," (Bottle at One Pint Pub Augustfest 10) Poured amber and cloudy. Head was large and white. Aroma was tart, malty and fruity.  Palate was medium bodied and bit warming with medium carbonation. Flavours were malts, sweetness, fruitiness, alcohol, solvent and medium bitterness. Aftertaste contained alcohol and bitterness.
"
1," JAN 8, 2009 Fantastic beer! Aroma is full of yeast and flowers, slight cigar in the background. Pours an almost perfect deep brown, with amber hues. Flavor is smooth and balanced, lots of yeast and some malt. Goes down great. This one is a great, great beer.
"
1," Strong delightful flavor you would savor for a while.Worth the price...
"
1," A one day old growler. The whole growler. Pours dark copper with a frothy, though quickly disappearing white head. The aroma is fairly hoppy, but only in the way of Euro hops. Wood, hay, and an interesting fruity character are noted. The mouthfeel is medium. This is pretty crisp, but not overly vegetal or doughy like a lager may be. The fruit notes are more like berries and less like apples. Hops are approachable but assertive, given the style. This is a basic beer that reminds me of the cheap crap in cans at the grocery store, but without any of the flaws. This is smooth, clean, and very drinkable without any surprises or super deep complexity.
"
1," Deep copper red wtih about 1/2"" of white head that goes away quickly, but maintains the slight moon ring down the glass until the end. Strong aroma of hops a beer that tasted alot like it smelled. It leaves a medium bittering on the back of your tongue. Not a bad brew at all I would be proud if I could clone it. I could drink it every day but couldnt drink it all day.
"
1," I enjoyed this Trappist beer very much.  It had a stronger taste than the other Trappist brews I tried, but it was a good taste.  I liked it better than the Orval but not as much as the Westmalle.
"
1," Just come back from the pub and have had a few of these - heavy but with a pleasant flavour and appetising taste
"
1," glue, medicines, chemicals, bad cider vinegar; the mouthfeel is a bit oily; they should try some real French farmhouse cider before comparing to them.
"
1," On tap.  Slightly more hop finish than what is typical for the style-- more like McNeills brown ale offering.  I liked it.
"
1," Had nearly 10 of their beers and this was by far my least favorite. A golden pour with nearly no head. Aroma and flavor is extremely light. This beer was very ordinary. Light pale ale qualities.
"
1," From large corcked bottle.  Sweet and malty.  Slightly fruity.  Alcohol well masked by ubermaltiness.  Descent, but not really my style of beer.
"
1," Pours hazy brown with bubbly tan head.  Aroma of spices, yeast, and fruits.  Taste of dark fruits, yeast, and slight banana flavor.  Medium mouthfeel.  Good.
"
1," Dark brown in color.  Dark pith fruits in flavor and aroma.  Also some roasted elements in the malty brew.  Very nice.
"
1," Bottle thanks to my girlfriends trip to Louisville. Pours a slightly murky red brown with fizzy tan head. Nose is munich malt and crystal malt, minimal spicy hops in the background. Wet cereal and a touch of chocolate. On taste, slight roast, biscuity notes, finish is sweet. Enough bitterness to balance. A bit effervescent. Thin body. Not bad.
"
1," I remember this to be a far better beer a few years ago. Although still a good beer this should be an excellent one. I was also dissapointed to note that they do not use proper cork in the larger bottles. Shame
"
1," Deep golden, big white stable head, distinctive sweet-malty nose with a distinctive touch of (Tettnang?) aroma hops; medium bodied, soft MF, moderate sweet-bitter flavour, shorter, aromatic hoppy and malty finish. A good, moreish Pilsener.......
"
1," Draft. Cloudy gold with a white head. Hop aroma with banana and clove notes. Great for the summer heat.
"
1," The Belgians are our friends. Still earthy/sweet as Belgian ales must be, very full and complex, and outstanding with a strong Honduran cigar.
"
1," Had this with jgb9348 as well! Deep brown color with a not so impressive white head. Some malt and chocolate linger in the aroma. Chocolate and a nutty taste, and one of the better beers from the visit to the brewery in Chattanooga.
"
1," Had on tap at the Chattanooga location - served as the nightcap to a fun evening with Shag and Cheri and my pick for a pint out of the sampler I had. Dark black appearance with a decent mocha head. Has a hard to describe,""creamy"" aroma. Has some coffee notes - yes, leans toward espresso.  Also has some chocolate and some creamy milkiness. Bitterness in the back end rounds it out nicely. Very good brewpub stout - according to the waiter - it is brewed with beans from a local coffee company.

1," When your lifelong Bud0swilling friends ask you what real beer tastes like, pour a wide-brimmed glass of this stuff and set it in front of them. The complexity of this stuff is utterly amazing. Unlike the other beers in the 8% and up club, Chimay seems to subliminally tell your body to slow down... a very good property, I must say.
"
1," Good aroma with many complex layers, sweet roasty toffee scents.  Dark cola brown with good head.  Dissapointed though by the flavor.  Strong alcohol taste on the finish lasts.  Palate was watery combined with the alcohol for an unpleasant finish.  Ok overall but not a great one for me.
"
1," This was my first Trappiste ale.  I didnt know what to expect being unwise in the way of Belgian ales.  Oh, but it didnt take me long to grasp the concept of finely concocted brews.  Deep copper color with an off-white head that foams up nicely then bubbles down to linger.  Smells nutty and raisiny.  Fairly acidic on the tongue with a lasting peppery finish.  Maybe not the best Trappiste but very accessible.  I wonder how many others began their appreciation of the monks with a goblet of Chimay.
"
1," Another quality session IPA.  The lowest ABV of any IPA I would buy for regular consumption.  Tasty..but could be improved upon a little bit.  A brand new batch was just made. Im with the guy who thinks Chinook...I love the grapefruit taste in this beer.  Mad Anthony India Pale Ale is 100% Chinook so that might explain why I like Barley quite well.  Ill ask Mike at Barley and report back with reviews on their full line.
"
1," Deep red-brown color. High carbonation led to huge head. Dissipated quickly. Very delicate aroma. Mild sweetness. Flavor is lite and clean w/ subtle chocolate. High carbonation is annoying. Otherwise, decent beer; nothing too exciting.

1," Clear brown with a beige head. Aroma is sweet, malty, caramel, yeasty and light spicy. Flavor is quite sweet and light bitter. Light dry and spicy finish. 250311
"
1," Deep red color with big head and high carb. Fruitty smelling. Prune and raisin taste with a yeast notes. This is a great beer to introduce drinkers to Belgium Beers.
"
1," 12oz green bottle. Sampled at the Lynnwood International Swill Fest. Fizzy yellow beer color. Small head. Aroma is malt, grain and fruit, touch of corn as well. A medium bodied Pale lager. Malts are fruity and VERY sweet. Slightly spicy hops. Kinda sweet, kinda thin, kinda flat, and kind Cornish. Not terrible, but nothing above a cookie cutter Euro Pale Lager either. There is a sweetish aftertaste that is kind of objectionable. Mouthfeel is thin. Finish is smooth. Aftertaste is sweetish.
"
1," FEB 12, 2004 Great beer. Dark amber, nice head, very complex flavors. Hints of different spices and fruits. One of my favorite beers.
"
1," Not bad, not great. The beer was a dark brown to black color with a tan head. The major thing I noticed about this was the overcarbonation. It almost tasted like flavored seltzer water. There were the obvious tasted of fruit and spices, but I could not taste in any great quantities over the carbonation. The aftertaste was non existent. I had this in the 11.2 oz bottle and the description is different than the one llisted. For the $8 price tag I paid at Mad Mex in Robinson, I expected a lot more. I am curious to try the others.
"
1," Nice pour with a heavy and tight head.  Initial taste is sweet and full of zest.  Not very complex at first taste but definably packs a bite.  Im not a big fan of triples but Im enjoying this quite a bit.  Its simplicity is its strength.  This beer is the perfect example that less is more.  Not bad.
"
1," Nashville.  Hoppy.  Faint honey taste with a lingering metallic aftertaste that Ive noticed on every one of their beers.
"
1," 12 fl oz bottle. Pours dark brown to black with a solid chocolate brown head. Roasted malt aroma, light hoppy note. Roasted malt flavoured, chocolate and smooth caramel too. Medium bitter and roasted malt flavoured finish.
"
1," Light bronze.  Beech nose.  Light body - a bit thin.  Good smoke character, though.  Not much  backing malt - this one is for smoke whores only I think.
"
1," Served in a goblet. Herbs + alcohol aroma. Red color yet clear with a white cap. Very bitter, light sweetness, tastes like kind bud. (Yes, kind bud.) Full body, creamy, average carbonation. Bartender suggested it after I requested New Albanian Elector, one of my favorite beers. Overall I was very impressed and plan to add this to my rotation of preferred pints.
"
1," 12oz. Bottle Pours  deep brown with reddish highlights with a small  off white head. Aroma is sweet and malty with notes of nuts, caramel, and hints toffee and honey.  Flavor is sweet and  malty with Carmel and toffee notes and a nutty finish
"
1," Not all that bad for a light beer, very little in the aroma, just a bit of hops in the nose, golden color, lacy head, of course a very watered down taste, not much body at all, but hey you have to expect that from a light beer
"
1," ( 330ml bottle) pours dark brown with great head. Nose of oranges, blueberries, and Belgian yeast. Taste of bread, molasses, dried fruits, raisins, blueberries, cherries, spicy yeast and a dry, sweet creamy finish.
"
1," Very pretty aroma. Bananas, plums, sweet rice pudding, tapioca. Pours pale gold leaving rich, oily legs down the glass. Flavor was drier than the sweet nose lets on. Some tropical fruit notes. Meduim to full bodied. Very rich and creamy. Nice sake for sure!
"
1," The best beer Ive ever had.  Just the right balance of malt and fruit and not overly strong.  Let it warm up a little and it tastes even better.
"
1," This is an absolute pleasure of a beer.  It looks beautiful, when the correct glass is used the head is lovely.  It smells lovely, and drinks... well, Ive almost not a bad wold to say about it.  The only thing I can say wrong about it is the Chimay white is better, but I think thats just down to my taste.
"
1," From 75cl bottle. Copper hazy body with a nice off-white head leaving a good lacing. Ripe banana, clove, bready nose with some hints of plum and apple. Sweet approach in mouth with lovely flavors of plum, vanilla, clove and wheat appearing in harmonious complexity. Silky consistency with a low carbonation gives a creamy texture to this brew which enhances well its flavors. Excellent beer, in the tradition of the brewer. Two thumbs up!
"
1," 330ml bottle, tulip glass.  A 100th percentile beer for my 100th rate. This beer had a lot of hype to live up to and I really enjoyed it. Very dark brown murky hue, creamy beige head dissipated to a thick creamy ring, fair lacing.  The complex and constantly changing aromas were a delight - toffee, caramel, biscuit, dark rye bread, brown sugar, dark fruit, a bit of banana, quite spicy a bit peppery?, lots of yeasty aromas especially leather, some musty hay barn, faint cheese, plus smoke, wood, peat,  tobacco, band-aid, dark NZ native flora honey, the list goes on - just loved how different aromas were gradually disclosed with warming.  Tastes very nice, mostly sweet with a spicy peppery twist.  Carbonation wanted to burst out the bottle and by the end of the glass was gone, syrupy/oily, smooth creamy, heavy side of medium bodied,  warming alcohol spicy finish.  Overall - very good.
"
1," 22 ounce thanks to Wes. Not too much carbonation. Bit of sweetness and malt mixed. Hops are battling that malt profile. Some oak. Interesting but slightly different kind of Quad. Not sure what to make of it yet.
"
1," 22 oz botle.  Pours a clear chestnut brown body with a small fizzy light brown head.  The nose is nutty and yeasty, with some light coffee and dark fruits.  Lots of Belgian yeast character here in the flavor.  Some dark fruits, heavy yeast, a little coffee on the back end, and finishes off with a bit of peppery alcohol.  Medium bodied with a somewhat watery texture and fizzy carbonation.  I wish that this were a little softer and rounder feeling.  OK beer, but nothing great.
"
1," Sample from bottle. Pours unclear orange/brown with light white head. Aroma is yeasty bubblegum and plastic. Flavour is dry, malty and bubblegum  and plastic again. Finish is dry bitter.
"
1," Pours hazy brown red with small off white head leaving some lacing on the glass. Nice malty full bodied aroma with some sweet fruits, dark syrup and caramel. Flavor is full bodied malty, fruity, spices, hops... lovely. Acidy sweet, lean crispy on palate-well balanced. Finishes with round malty and hoppy aftertaste.
"
1," Chimay is a quality brand and beer. But I have to say that this beer is my least favorite of the Chimay family. Still very high quality beer. Just a little more bitter than the Blue and Cinq white
"
1," earthy tones, tasted at blm sample. earthy flavors smooth, tasted very organic, unlike most beers, well balanced with hops and malt. VERY NICE.
"
1," Draft at brew pub.  Pours black with a quick fading brown head.  Aroma is of fresh hops, brewed coffee, and strong with roasted coffee beans.  Flavor is very strong of coffee, with a burnt flavor left in the palate.  Very one dimensional.  Palate is thin and lightly carbonated,  I really hoped there would be more body.  Still a great session beer.
"
1," grapes, spicy black pepper, alcohol.  Flavour was like a woody red wine with some sourness that was not vinegary.  Raisin, grape, currant, cognac.  Creamy medium body.  Excellent.

"
1," Thanks to Thorpe for this baby. AttheDHL fest. Murky caramel color, medium off white head, tons of suspended particles, looks like space junk. Aroma of malty butterscotch. Taste has a sweet start, bitter finish. Very malty with hefty spice. An interesting newcomer.
"
1," Bottle. Bubblegum, figs, cherries, grapes, and light banana aromas. Cloudy orange-red with a thin head. Flavor is clean with raisin and candy notes. Bubblegum and spice. Good balance. Thick and chewy with moderate carbonation.
"
1," Pours a dark amber color with a medium head. Thin lacing. Good for an amber, but still average for a beer.  Aroma and flavor exhibit a bit of citrus and hops, good maltiness as well.
"
1," Pours medium brown with small tan head.  Aroma is caramel, malt, dried fruit, mild yeast. Taste is medium sweet with a hint of bitterness. Full body, nice creamy texture, a bit fizzy (perhaps a bad pour?). Finish is mild. My fave Chimay.
"
1," Bottle from Sainsburys. It pours amber, with a thin foamy white head. The nose is wet grass, chlorine, spinach, sweet malt and peach. The taste is tangy lemon, lime, peach, grapefruit, lager-shandy, grass, cardboard and metal, with a light bitter finish. Very thin, with low carbonation. A bit weird.
"
1," Lighter in color and lower in alcohol than Chimay Bleu.  The aroma is like that of a fine bakery.  you will be able to taste 7% alcohol, but that will not interfere with your enjoyment.  Although still a sweet ale, the taste is surprisingly dry given the high gravity and fruity aroma.
"
1," Hand bottle pours a deep cloudy ruby red with a light white fizzy head with almost no retention or lacing.		Smells of malts, raisins, and booze.  Flavor is complex but smooth, hiding most of the booze that appears in the nose.  Plums, raisins, malts and yeast bounce through the flavors and this beer goes down smoothly.
"
1," From bottle on 12/24/2009.  Pours a dcark amber/brown with light creamy head.  Aroma to sweet side with toffee, caramel, dark fruit notes.  Finishes a bit dry with a bite of alcohol.  Overall a very pleasant beer to savor.  Well balanced throughout.
"
1," Tasted at the Beer of Summer event at Oldsmar Tap House. Pours a burnt orange with a small white head. Sweet aroma, citrus, but not very strong. Taste is decent, citrus, piney, with a light malty taste. medium mouthfeel, atleast goes down smooth. A decent beer but nothing more.
"
1," Creamy head, light, fruity apricot aroma. Mouth is fruity. Its silky with light bitterness. Palate, is astringent.
"
1," Yeasty and carbonation aroma. Brown color, beige/grey head, good lace though. Neutral start, metalic bitter and later on a little sweetness. Finish is long with a nasty bitterness.
"
1," bottle - Pours jet black with a one finger tan head.  The aroma had good roast malt and coffee components.  Theres plenty of coffee and dark roasted malts in the flavor.  It seemed a bit more bubbly on the palate than most stouts.  There was some bitterness in the finish and of course some lingering coffee flavors.  Its good, but you better like coffee.
"
1," On tap at the bar at the brewery.	Beautiful looking beer, ample head, clear bright amber color. 	Decent but subdued malt aroma. The flavor was scaled back a bit too, but this was one of the better ones Ive had from there so far. Just needs a bit more body and flavor to suit me.
"
1," Pours a dark,loamy ,Earth-tone brown..with a slight rubyish accent with a nice sized light tan head..beautiful.		A fantastic aroma..rich and plummy almost figlike  some blackcurrant shines through too..great.		Great tasteing brew very  deep and complex  with the plum and fig to the fore..nice alcohol warmth from this baby.	Despite the strong alcohol its easy to drink..this could gget a guy in trouble!	excellent beer
"
1," Bottle, bought @ Riepen, Niebll.	Light hazy dark golden with a small, staying, frothy, off-white head. Aroma has grains, grass, hay, some piney bitterness. Highish carbonation, fine light creamy and dry mouthfeel. Flavour is elegant, sweet pilsner malts as base, lots of fresh grassy hops, light floral and piney. A soft metallic hint. Otherwse a very fine kellerbier.
"
1," This beers pours very dark with an abundant white head. The taste is of roasted barley, brown sugar, and carmel. The alcohol content, although higher than most beers I drink, did not seem obtrusive. The spices in this brew are very complex and continually changing. The aftertaste lingers on to infinity...a true classic.
"
1," 0.33l botttle. Pours a cloudy light brown body with a red hue, lots of black sediments and a big fluffy off-white head. Aroma is light fruity, some yeast, malty, light sugar candy and some mild plums. Body is mild and smooth, mildly carbonated and has a slick, watery and vanishing mouthfeeling. Nice and sweet flavors with some brown caramel, malts, ripe strawberries and ends with a little alcohol finish and a lightly sour aftertaste. Quite low on the bitterness. Nice indeed.
"
1," Poured into my Chimay goblet. Ruddy, cloudy, and yeasty. Very dark and opaque with a perfect tan head that leaves tons of lacing.		Entrancing aromas of dark fruits with a little peppery alcohol.		Flavor is rich and fruity, with tons of plum and fig. Burnt caramel, molasses, tobacco, and some nuttiness also appear.		Smooth on the palate, with the moderate carbonation slicing through the full body. Great beer.
"
1," Bottle thanks to thirdeye11.  Black with a khaki head.  Nose is coffee and roasted malts.  Definite flavor of wood and roasted malts with vanilla in the finish.
"
1," following the aroma, plenty of dark, roasted coffee and dark chocolate; not incredibly deep (predominantly coffee over a basic chocolate malt core), but still pleasant; a touch chalky mid-palate.  Medium finish"
1," Chimay is the most commercial of the Trappist beers...this can be found in many stateside specialty stores.  It comes in Bleue, Rouge, and Blanc...decending in alcohol content.  The Bleue is by far the best of the three..but the taster must like strong flavored ales.  Very good beer, but 4 or 5 will cause you to hate yourself in the morning.
"
1," One of my top five favorite beers.  Dark amber color, off-white head which lasts a good while.  Flavor is slightly sweet with a hint of nut/spice.  Very good beer.
"
1," Bottled. Aroma of german hops, caramel malts, butterscotch. Hazy, brown coloured with an off-white head. Taste is sweet with a lot of malts. Bit siruppy. Medium bodied. Okay beer.
"
1," This was the beer that got me into good beer. I cant really describe the flavor, but I know that I like it. Unlike a lot of high alcohol beers, it isnt overly sweet.
"
1," 33 cl bottle. Deep cloudy red with large stable beige head. Malty aroma with lots of dried fruit (peach and apricot) and a clear yeast note, and a hint of spicy hops. Medium to thick bodied, smooth mothfeel, perfect carbonation. Some malt sweetness in the flavour that is avertaken by an earthy, dry finish.
"
1," Pours light golden with a mostly receding foamy off-white head. Aroma of banana, spicy phenolics, orange peel. Taste is orange peel, banana, light malt. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, lightly creamy from the yeast with lush carbonation. Pretty nice witbier.
"
1," Clear medium brown with a small soapy head of white.	Some malt in the aroma.  Some sourness that shouldnt be there as well.	Not much flavor for a style that should present lots of malty goodness.	Very disappointing.
"
1," Bottle @ home. Amber/brown appearance with a smallish tan head. Toasty, brown malty, toffee nose. Well carbonated, nutty, a touch spicy, toffee, brown malty flavor thats very easy drinking.
"
1," From a 12 oz. bottle with no freshness date, sampled at cellar temperature in a pint glass.		Poured a hazy orangey copper with a foamy off-white head that settled into a thin sudsy lacing.		Aromas of toasted caramel and grains, floral, citrus and a touch of pine.		Moderate carbonation and a crisp, dryish, smooth medium bodied mouthfeel.		Tastes of sour citrus, earthy as well, the hops have a soft bitterness, toasted grain and a light caramel, nutty butter, towards the green pine needles come out, and a dryish, sour fruity, malty finish.		I looked at the website, but I have no idea what they mean by ""Tavern Style Pale Ale,"" I could see this being related to a 1930s APA recipe or a take on the English pale ale. Easy smooth drinkability, not bad, I prefer this to their IPA.
"
1," 330ml Bottle. Pours dark red/brown with an off-white head. Aroma is quite light, thin even, but has hints of nuts, caramel and dark fruits. Flavours of toffee, pepper, malt and clove are present but with very little sweetness. All in all a nice dubbel, a great example of the style, but I have had others that I prefer.
"
1," Pours a cloudy milky consistency, nose is nice and earthy with a snap of sweetness in the mouthfeel. Balanced and clean for a nigori with a pleasing plum taste in the finish. Nice and chewy with a marshmallowy background.
"
1," Big ol thick heavy head, dark caramel color.  Champaigney mouthfeel.	An outstanding beer, and I think one of the better strong abbeys.    Not QUITE as good as the Rocqufort, but pretty dang close.
"
1," Draught in Chattanooga.  Brewed for UTCs homecoming.  Pours copper with a medium frothy off-white head and spotty lacing.  Malt (grain, meal) and yeast (sweat, horse blanket) aromas with citrus hop notes.  Yeast and hoppy malt flavor.  Medium bodied and crisp, clean palate.
"
1," 
"
1," Poured into a snifter. Sinister Minister pours an extremely rich mahogany, with a slightly tan head, with a low retention rate, which leads to decent lacing. Aromas are of sweet malts, raisins, candi sugar, spices like cinnamon, nutmeg and clove. Sweet malty taste, spices, fall fruits, molasses. It kind of reminds me of a less carbonated Trois Pistoles. Crisp, clean and smooth mouthfeel. Not as carbonated which is nice. Very good drinkability. This is the first pro-am I have had, and it is a great one to start with.
"
1," Pours a pitch black color with a medium diminishing light brown head. Good aroma of chocolate and bourbon. Good flavor of chocolate, mild hops, bourbon and roasted malt. The body is light to medium and dry with lively carbonation.
"
1," 750mL bottle, gift for 21st birthday. I warmed this one up a bit. Pours deep hazy red/orange, sediment came in the second pour from the bottom. Tan head. A strong caramel malt note in the aroma, bringing with it some raisin. Hops are detectable on the aroma, which I like. Feels spritzy on the tongue, that raisin fruit comes in first, followed by a relaxed hop bitterness which slowly fades to the astringent finish. Quite enjoyable, and not overly complex, i could have two or three of these. Very nice.
"
1," Bottle from Csak a j sr. Poured murky, deep-brown and massive, firm, beige foam. Not very complex, light hints of caramel and flowers in the nose. Aroma of plum, raisins and cocoa. Sweet, but not too much, well balanced with a discreet hoppyness in the finish, which is then settled with a sweet aftertaste that lasts. Alcohol is well hidden. Everything is in order, even if it could use more complexity.
"
1," (bottle) copper with nice head. Citrus/floral aroma. Flavor is citrus/floral hops with caramel malt.
"
1," Draft sample at the Southern Brewers Festival (9/05).  It actually took me a while to find this brew in the data base.  I almost reentered it under another name.  At any rate, this beer is supposedly brewed with coffee from the Stone Cup Roasting Company.  Pours a dark brown with minimal head, clear.  The aroma is nutty, malty, and heavy on the coffee/espresso notes.  The flavor is (duh) coffee!  Quite heavy on the coffee actually.  There is also what I will describe as a toffee-ish character but mostly a roasted malt presence and a light sweetness.  The body is light-medium but crisp, just like you might describe an iced coffee.  Really not a bad brew, but I found my self thinking that I could not drink too much of it.
"
1," JUN 19, 2006 Wondeful dark golden pour, with a large frothy head.  Aroma of sweet fruit, with a nice balance of taste between sweet fruit and bitterness.  My favorite of the 3 main Chimay beers.
"
1," Strong banana esters. Some alcohol aroma. Malt and subtle roastiness. Fruity. Subtle papery taste -- oxidized? Good regardless...
"
1," MAR 23, 2009 Bottle, 33cl. Pours ruby brown with a beige head. Bitter touch to fruity aromas. Harmoniously balanced trapist.
"
1," Golden colour with a white head. Malty and grainy aroma with a light sweetness. Malty somewhat buttery flavor.
"
1," well, i really like all the beers characteristics, but i just dont think it comes together aswell as it could. Very Belgian, but a bit chemically towards the finish, some alcohol burn (which doesnt bother me too much), i just dont think the caramel/choc/fruit malt flavours blend so well together, relatively dry though, which is always a good thing in my book. Make sure you get it with a bit of age, and preferably in the corked 750ml bottles. A young Chimay isnt that good IMHO. Ive got a 1998 Chimay Magnum waiting for me, and im looking in Eczematics direction to share one with me.
"
1," Bottle.  Cloudy brown pour with great thick lacing and thin tan head.  Aroma of caramel malt.  Taste of malt with molasses, caramel and yeast.  Great finish, one of the best widely available Belgians indeed.
"
1," Six pack from Kahns, Indianapolis.  I only bought it because my wifes name is Helene.  Turned out though to be not that bad.  Nice malty backbone that reminded my of Newcastle Brown.  A bit rough about the edges, but a drinkable beer.
"
1," Sparkling amber, beige head, scarce bead.Pleasant spiced nose. Spiced dry malt profile, medium bodied, noticeable hops in finish
"
1," Bottle from  Fristo Getrnke-Markt, Stuttgart.  Golden color with small white head. Aroma of malt, some hops. Taste, grain, malt, light bitterness in background. Light bitter finish. Not bad.
"
1," Very content with this beer. Aroma was a sweet candy smell. Looks were appealing due to the dark amber shade. Very nice flowing choclatey taste very pleased with this beer and glad I got to share it with Cheri, wunderbier and Shag.
"
1," Bottle.  Poured an amber color with a three finger white head.  Aroma of malt, caramel and fruit.  Flavor was sweet malt and a bitterness at the end.  Good beer.
"
1," MAR 29, 2004 Pours with a thick head, hazy brown color.  Lots of fruity apricot taste, finishes dry.
"
1," MAY 25, 2007 Bottle.  Light brown pour.  Cloudy, with a fine off-white head.  Dcent aroma, classic dubbel profile.  Good malt character, very little bitterness.  Always decent.
"
1," Ar- The aroma of the beer has peppery yeast esters rising from the glass. These combine well with flowery notes. Slightly roasted malt notes heading into caramel region. Lots of dark fruityness. Its like a bready fig newton with a pleasant alcohol kick.		Ap- The body of the beer is dark brown with ruby highlights. The head was a thick biege coloration. Settling into a ring of foam. Steaks of lacing marks this beers passage.		T- Roasted malty caramel, peppery yeast, a bit of chocolate heading into dark fruit figs in particular. The beer has a nice sweetness but is never cloying. 		P- The body is full but well carbonated. The alcohol is a bit hot but not annoying. 		O- A very complex and enjoyable beer drinking experience. This bottle may have been a bit young bottled on 2/11.
"
1," Pours a very dark brown with a small head and some lace. The aroma is a bit stinky up front to be honest, sort of like dank hops but slinkier. There is also some cherry and apple with some light cinnamon and light wood with aa fair bit of Christmas cookie spice. The flavor is very woody with some burnt malt bitterness. The woodiness sort of dominates and is a bit brash but as the beer warms it gives way to notes of raisin, fruit, and over steeped chamomile tea. Interesting beer to say the least.
"
1," Pours a golden clear colour at first, which turns into a murky amber. Pouring in the yeast sediment leaves dark brown stains on the otherwise white head. Citric, yeasty aroma. I was surprised by the taste. Hoppiness and a very strong yeastiness. Banana and citrus could be tasted, too. This beer is somewhere between a regular Hefeweizen and a ""Zum Uerige Weizen"". Very nice, for a change.
"
1," Better than most beers. Citrus flavor and fruity on the nose. Very nice but I usually go woth the blue.  Perhaps its peer pressure.
"
1," Bottle purchased at Corral in Granite City, IL. This poured with lots of floaters in the medium amber colored body. A light khaki head was on top. The aroma was basic oranges and bread crust. The taste was some grapefruit and a little bread crust. A nice woody finish. A decent IPA.
"
1," (330ml bottle) pours a reddish-brown with huge voluminous head, great lacing. A beautiful beer. Nose has cinnamon, bready yeast, light hops, and raisins. Quite complex in the taste too. Sweet raisins and malt, slight hop bitterness to balance it out, spicy yeast, and a great finish. Creamy and velvety too. One of my favorite trappist beers and possibly Chimays best in my opinion.
"
1," Just like the rochefort 10 just more subtle and suave, flavors arent as intense as they are elegant, an amazing belgian quad
"
1," Silky smooth hops. Good spice to balance. Good overall just not my style. Ok brew.
"
1," This beer mostly gets its points for smell.  Smells very hoppy.  Tastes very hoppy.  I didnt really like it much.
"
1," DEC 23, 2007 Re-rate.  6/2006.	2006 vintage 33cl bottle brought direct from Belgium	Oh my goodness.  This was an absolutely superb beer.  Poured deep dark drown with the classic ample Chimay head.  Aroma was flowery with lots of yeast.  The flavor was pure heaven.  Didnt seem to have as much sediment in the bottle as the Red does.  My new favorite Chimay.	Update  12/2007.	Just had the 2007 vintage.  This is what beer is supposed be.
"
1," Draft. Dark copper color with a medium off white head. Sweet, hoppy aroma. Big hop flavor all the way through. Slight citrus notes. C
"
1," JAN 22, 2010 Nice belgian quality brew. Taste gets better along the way. Little spicy and a bit sour like in the beginning, but gets sweeter and more malty. Very enjoyable. 		4 sept. 2005"
1," Draught at the Hamilton Place location. Pours light copper with sticky off-white head. The aroma is very mild with toasted malt, a tangerine hint, and subtle fruity hops. The flavor is very mellow with toasted malt, a hint of caramel, a little bit of wood. Theres a sweetness that somehow reminds me of the marshmallows in Lucky Charms cereal. Light fruity hops in the finish. The caramel quality sticks around through the aftertaste. It seems to get fruitier after several sips.
"
1," Deep brown in color with ruby hues. Huge, fluffy off white head pours three fingers thick. Excellent retention. Sheets of lace cascade down the sides of the glass.  Offensive malts. Rotten fruit. White pepper. Clove. Asprin. Warming alcohol.  Stinky bready malts with caramel undertones are followed by flavors of rancid fruit and a hint of lime citrus juice. Medicinal hops chime in and are drowned out by cloves and a white sour spice on the tongue.  I only had one and the next day my poop was black.
"
1," Draught, at the Railway ClubBright dark amber colour.  Fairly rich caramel aroma.  Very creamy body with light chocolate, fig, toffee and Devon cream notes.  Soft, sweet finish.  A unique, distinctive beer.  Youll want to be in the mood for something sweet, but its pretty tasty, reminiscent of some of the soft, sweet Belgians (Cuvee de lErmitage, Petrus Dubbel Bruin) in the way it presents itself.
"
1," Tasted 8/11/10. Sampler from the Brewpub. Hazy with a pale golden hue. White ring of head. Aromas of mild orange, but overall rather faint aromatics. Light to medium bodied and a little thin in the palate. Chalky perfumy yeast and bitter citrus. Dry finish with a dash of pepper. Decent.
"
1," Bready fragrance; no hops.  Clear straw color with receding head.  Spicy hops start, quickly fading to cleansing bitterness that finishes.  Carbonation, light body and bitterness impart a clean taste.  A traditional bitter.
"
1," 12 oz bottle from secret santa. This one was a little to watery and not a whole lot of flavor.
"
1," This beer had a very small sized off-white head that consisted of fine-small bubbles.The body was clear and no carbonation was observed.The hue was reddish-brown and the lacing was excellent on the sides of my glass.The nose was fruity and the flavor was bitter, hoppy and it left a lingering aftertaste.The mouthfeel of this beer was smooth, thin and watery.
"
1," Pours opaque brown with a tan head. The head lasts for a while. Aroma had a floral sweet spice smell that I could not place. The flavor is very complex. Malt, yeast and dark fruit present in the taste.Definitely tasted better as it warmed.
"
1," My favorite of the Chimays.  Pleasant spicy malt flavor.
"
1," A brilliant, full flavoured ale. Stront carbonation, hint of fruitiness without the bitterness or burnt aftertaste of many dark ales. 		I was lucky enough, living in China where a good selection of beer isnt ready available, to be given 3 bottles of Grand Reserve by my students. Best gift ever.
"
1," FEB 26, 2008 330ml bottle 2006 vintage, served with a slight chill. Replacing  my 07 review to reflect the 06 vintage. Gave it a good turn to get the sediment roused. Pours a murky mahogany body with quick dying tan foam. Nose packed full of dark and dried fruits; figs, dates, plums, raisins, some underlying doughy yeast, notes of wood, vanilla and leather, with an edge of alcohol. Creamy body, velvety carbonation, good richness to it disguising the abv well as it warms going down. Deeply complex body, decidedly woody overall with a touch of earthy vanilla, sweetened by dried fruits and spice. Finish is lingering with bread and spice, a touch of bitterness. Certainly changes with a bit of age, I daresay not as robust but far more complex.
"
1," Red-orange with a light tan head.  Aroma is toasty and caramel maltiness.  Taste is the same toasted malt, caramel, citrus and pine hops.
"
1," OCT 24, 2007 750mL bottle (2003).  Ive had this beer from the bottle a few times.  I maintain that it is somewhat overrated, as there are better belgians Ive had.  Red, brown gold tones in the color with a range of peachy citrus to nutty/alcohol in the aroma.  VERY full bodied, meaty beer though.  Its almost like drinking a beer off the filter.  Certainly complex, and provides a variety of flavors when drunk at different temperatures. Too much head for my liking, but was to be expected off such a yeasty beer.1983 bottle sampled in August 2005.  Has aged magnificently.11/05 vintage dated 750mL bottle drunk on 7/7/07Raisins, pears, figs, apples and other mostly clean Belgian yeast esters, with caramel sweetness in the background.  Its a pleasant aroma, though even after only 3 months, my memory recalls little to distinguish this beer.  Or perhaps, more accurately, my memory recalls that there really is little to distinguish in this beer.Similar flavor profile, your typical well-made Quad, with soft malty sweetness (caramels, raisins, prunes, figs) and lighter, minimally tart apple/cherry esters towards the end.  Yeast seems more clean and less ""rustic"" or ""charming"" or what have you, than in past samples.  Musty, corky, earthy and woody are flavors I associated with this beer, for the better, but now its just a rather plain Belgian Dark Strong.  Nothing wrong with it, but hardly anything Ill go out of my way to drink again.  Alcohol well concealed, no flaws.  Score is for this bottle.
"
1," A favorite.  Provind that strong beer doesnt have to taste like ...strong beer.  Incredibly smooth, beautiful dark brown, pours with a modest, lasting head.  Smooth malt caramel flavor, the hearth, the beer equivalent of a precious metal.
"
1," Bottle bought from Waitrose consumed at home. Realised Ive not rated one of my favourite classics. Must amend. Probably my favourite commercial beer. Yes a COMMERCIAL beer from a monastry. Very spicey on the aroma. Slightly foral too. A lovely thick head. Classic appearance. Good texture. Caramel body; spices, roasted malts, burnt toast, some woody and oaky notes develop with age also sherry from the 1982 I had in the Kulminator. Good doughy barnyard yeast. Goes excellently with proper chese. This beer should be a staple to your diet. If its not than why??
"
1," The Chimay Red poured a cloudy copper-gold.  It had a fizzy fine-bubbled white head that had decent retention.		The aroma was very vinous (red wine / champagne) with some sour notes.		The flavor was strong pear and champagne with smaller notes of alcohol and a little sourness.  Some yeastiness and bitterness came out as it warmed.  The mouthfeel was pretty smooth, but a little fizzy.		Overall, I personally didnt care for the flavor at all (pear and champagne).  I really dont like champagne and this was way too similar for me.  It was pretty well made and did get a little better as it warmed, but I was already tuned into the flavors I didnt care for.
"
1," 12 oz. bottle.  Pours a dark brown with light tan head.  Aroma of toasted bread, chocolate, and the smallest hint of vanilla..  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy.  Flavor is dominated by roasted malt notes.  Some chocolate and a light bitter flavor at the end.  Nice beer.

1," DEC 5, 2010 (several vintages without significant aging)	(a 1998 in 2010)		cpr-opq, med bod, med co2, ~head, 		fresh Ts T1, fruity hoppy bitter T2 T3, bitter Tf.		12 yr old - very sweet, with strong notes of wood and sherry.
"
1," Bottle, 6.5%. Slow gusher. Yeasty, vinous, roasted aroma. Very dark brown colour, big unstable tan head. The flavour is sweet, vinous, chocolaty with some alcohol. Distinct yeast finish.
"
1," 3 musketeers and this one lead the team. The most powerful, strongest charismatic character. Strength not only trough alcohol but also trough rich sweet complex, hi dry plum with hopy medium bitter finish. Alcohol is present but it is well refined and not offensive.
"
1," Bottle 330ml @ fonefan	Pours pale green with a small white head. Aroma has notes of lime. Taste is light sweet and light sour. Body is light, texture is thin, carbonation is soft.
"
1," Pours brownish red with very light tan, moderately rocky head that is short lasting.  Some alcohol in the nose with fruit aroma.  Medium maltiness with solid carmel notes.  Tried a bottle of this in Belgian last year- vintage 1991 which was much more complex (due to good aging).  Great beer!
"
1," Bottle 500ml. w. swing top.Clear medium orange yellow color with a average to large, frothy, good lacing, mostly lasting, white to off-white head. Aroma is moderate malty, toasted, keller, damp stain - fusty notes. Flavor is moderate sweet and light to moderate bitter with a average to long duration, malty, light cardboard. Body is medium to light, texture is oily to watery, carbonation is soft. [20110128]
"
1," MAR 7, 2007 Another lovely belgian trappist beer, one of my favorites. A dark color and a long lasting finish.
"
1," DO NOT DRINK COLD!! If taken cold it starts of Raunchy and stale, metalic and alcohol tasting and very earthy, vegetable flavors stand out so does the beet candy. When its left to warm, the sweet malts stand out with a nice woody background, spices, honey and yeast are present too. The palate becomes smoother as too does the carbonation. It still finishes a bit twingy and vegetabaly but very faintly soo.
"
1," Light lemon and strong cherry aroma. Dark brown color, cloudy, almost no head. Sweet, sour start but this weakens, light bitter, some citrus, cherry, complex but metallic, medium body.
"
1," Bottle from Systembolaget. I dont have a lot of experience with trappist beers overall and I must admit that this is not really my kind of beer. Pours a brownish colour with a thin foam. Taste is slightly sweet with hints of caramel, hardly any bitterness.
"
1," Aromas of fruit and spice.Pours amedium copper with a huge long lasting  off white head.Fruits and yeast stand out in the flavors.Medium to thin mouthfeel with some spices in a smooth finish.
"
1," (BELGIUM) Had this one at the Capts house, Thanks guys!!!  WOW, I was told by AFI96 that this one would be the best. It has a brown / burgundy color with a nice foamy white head. The flavor has a pleasant fizzy vanilla / cookie taste. Its a full bodied brew that goes down quickly. Do yourself a favor, go get some !!!
"
1," Pours a lovely dark cloudy brown with a stiff beige head, no lacing. Aroma is of fermented fruits, nuts, and warm alcohol notes. Flavor is full bodied and complex, a great Belgian Ale, with fruit, bread, chocolate, and toffee notes. One of my favorites.
"
1," Ok, I love trappist beers and this is one of the better ones. Its great because it has wonderful flavor and it is not as expensive as the other Trappists. Very complex flavor. Great color, smell, everything about this beer is great!
"
1," NOV 9, 2011 Ive had this in two forms (the 750ml corked and the 12oz capped bottle) and have the 3L waiting for my graduation from seminary in 2012.  The beer pours a murky brown color with an off white The smell is he least boozy of the trappists with a very sweet dried fruit smell with some yeast.  The taste is smooth and crisp witha very sweet finish of sugary fruits.   the smell is sugary and dried fruit.  This is a great beer to share with new comers to the beer world.  Ive never had a person not like this heavy hitting beer.
"
1," Bottle.  Surprising that I havent rated this yet.  Pours a mostly clear reddish brown color with a larger off white head.  The aroma and flavor are both heavily influenced by dark fruits such as cherries and plums.  Additional flavors are sweet candi sugar, some floral notes and a big yeast presence.  This is a nice beer, but I prefer others in the style more (R 8 and 10).
"
1," 12 Ounce bottle from ekoerper as a bonus.  Pours a dark, dark black with a thick tan head that quickly disappears.  Aromas of raisins, brown sugar and oak.  Flavors of red wine and rasins, not a great aftertaste.
"
1," (Bottle 50 cl) Amber golden and slightly hazy with a small, off-white head. Slightly spicy, caramelish, sweet aroma. Soft mouthfeel, plenty of roasted, malty flavours and soft, lightly sweet caramel. Very discreet bitterness. Fine all right. 101105
"
1," Nose of bourbon whiskey, oak, earthy hop notes, and roasted malts. Pours dark brown with some red hues, fizzy tan head, decently lasting. Bourbon flavors up front, woody oak followed by light roasted malts, and subtle bitterness in the finish. Some lingering bourbon barrel flavors. Not hot, nice bourbon flavors, but the depth that the beer offers could be upped. Body was somewhat thinned out by the barrel I would assume. Still a solid offering.
"
1," Bottled. A hazy golden beer with a thin beige. The aroma is sweet with notes of grain. The flavor is very sweet malty combined with grains, hops, and alcohol, leading to a bitter finish. Too simple.
"
0," Bottle, courtesy of fonefan. A greenish yellow-golden drink with a small, white head. Artificial lemon aroma, rather intense and pushing. Thin on the palate, with flavors of artificial lemon and something reminiscent of lemon peel. Rather horrible. 110130
"
1," een lekker bier maar met een lelijke kleur troebel donker bruin. Wel een zeer zoete zachte lekkere smaak. Met een lekker zoet aroma.
"
1," Murky Brown with small brown head.  Strong vineous syrupy sour aroma.  Wow, very unique taste.  That vineous sour aroma transfers to the taste.  Taste is red wine and dark fruit balanced by sweet malt and some hops.  The wine flavor is a bit sharp.  Also notes of brown sugar, caramel, sour apple and honey.  Complex...VERY.  This is one of the craziest beers Ive ever had.  With every sip I like it more, but couldnt --wouldnt want to drink more than one.
"
1," Draft-Big River Brewery-Chattanooga, TN. A small sized tan head that contained fine-medium sized bubbles. The body was uncarbonated, somewhat transparent with a brown hue. The nose was malty with a brown and malty flavor. The mouthfeel was tingly on the tongue and this was a medium bodied beer.
"
1," GABF 2010.  Pours clear brown with an average, frothy beige head, medium retention with good lacing.  Aroma is heavy malt (cookie, caramel, chocolate), light hops (woody), and light esters (dried fruit) with notes of dates.  Flavor is heavy malt (cookie, caramel), light hops (grassy), and light esters (dried fruit) with notes of sour milk.  Light body, low warmth, carbonation, and creaminess with a dry finish.
"
1," (Draught) Sampled at The Beagle in Victoria for $5.65 a pint. Pours a thin, tan head with a deep chestnut coloured body. Nose is mildly nutty as is the flavour. The malt is very thin and, though it has a nice texture, its a pretty flavourless beer.
"
1," AUG 26, 2007 Dark copper-coloured beer. Smells good, nice carbonation. I thought the blue was a little bit better, but the white cant cope with this excellent brune!
"
1," On tap at the Crescent moon. Pours light amber with an off-white head and very large carbonation bubbles. Muted grainy aroma. The flavor is very much like the pre-prohibition lager except it has a fruity element to it. Finishes with a harsh aftertaste very reminiscent of the pre-prohibition lager.
"
1," Pours a hazy amber with a white head.  Smells of citus and some coriander.  Tastes citrussy with some banana splashes and a coriander and ginger finish.
"
1," 22 oz. bottle.  Pours brown with garnet highlights and a medium sized beige head.  The aroma has moderate sweetness, yeast, a mix of fruits, and lightly spicy.  The flavor had bready malts, slightly fruity, dusty, yeast, but there seems to be something wrong.  I wasnt sure how old this was, but it appears as if this is in a downward spiral.  Medium bodied.  I should try this again when I know its fresher.
"
1," bottle. Pours a cloudy dark orange with a nice foamy white head. The aroma is full and floral with plenty of dry fruits. Nice rich dry spiced notes with a thinner underlying sweetness. The finish lingers with a hint of alcohol, some fading sugar, and really brings everything together.
"
1," pours cloudy redish brown with small tan head. dark fruits, caramel, and yeast flavors. pretty good pretty smooth
"
1," Bottle shared by footbalm, thanks man. Pours a clear light brown color with a small off-white head. A nice aroma of yeast, fruit, some spices and sweet sugars. The taste reminded me of a BSA mixed with a doppelbock, loads of yeast, sweet fruits, caramel, cherries, some strong and sweet malts. A fizzy and full mouthfeel. A spicy flavor also, mostly banana and clove flavors. Very nice.
"
1," Like a previous reviewer, I also liked this beer, but was a bit underwhelmed. Everything about it is good, but not amazing.
"
1," Draught at Chattanooga with boto.	A one fingered tan head arrived on this over chilled mug of black colored brew.	As it warmed, some chocolate and coffee came through to join the roasted malt aroma. Good body, smooth and easy drinking.
"
1," nice beer, well balanced just the right amount of hop vs malt flavors. amber or red is my favorite!
"
1," Grande Rserve - Beautiful foamy head with generous lacing. Interesting  fruity aromas combined with good malt. The alcohol is well balanced as the rest of this great trappist.
"
1," Bottle thanks to bu11zeye.  The look is clear, light white head, the color is brown.  The smell is sugary, caramel, and malts.  The taste is malts, roasty, and coffee.
"
1," Aroma is slightly hoppy with floral undertones - very crisp and neat.  Pours with a nice white head that persists.  Nice lacing, cloudy body.  A sweet start with a bitter finish (which nicely disguises the 8% ABV), this ale is smooth and tasty.  There is something in the taste that makes me think of wildflowers...Light and creamy on the tongue with a tingling sensation as the bubbles from the head pass over.
"
0," This beer has a big build up and then lets you down, just like the Big 10 in National Championship games.
"
1," Pitch black pour with Dr. Pepper edges; no discernable carbonation, minimal head that dissipates quickly but leaves 1/4-finger foam.  Lace settles quickly back down into head.		Cinnamon, molasses, brown sugar, toffee, coffee, hint of chocolate in the nose.  Would rate higher except for faint whiff of medicinal aroma.		Mouth is chewy, aerated.		Chocolate and roast coffee up front on the tongue, slightly bitter malt/hops, brown sugar at finish with slight intionations of bourbon.  Seems well blended overall if a tiny bit shrill on the back end.		Has a minor tart aftertaste that I could do without (hard water used?).  Otherwise pretty well done.  I imagine a cask conditioned sample direct from the brewery (if available) would hit the spot.
"
1," SEP 30, 2008 Sour lambic aroma.  White head with golden honey colors.  Dryish flavor with a sweetish balance, malt, hay, cookie, dried fruits and slightly bitter finish.  Rich and even palate with strong carbonation.  Quite good.
"
1," like other Trappist beers, even Chimay Bleu gives its best only at the right temperature. Don't drink it too much cold!!!)
"
1," bottle. Clear pale golden yellow, large and creamy white head. Hoppy nose. Medium-to full-bodied, solid malty base with some intensive hoppy flavours, very aromatic. Well-balanced and clean Pilsener.
"
1," Growler Clear, copper ale with a mid-sized, fat-bubbled, off-white head. Good retention. Malty, buttery aroma  also notes of vanilla and very light milk chocolate. Full-bodied and lightly creamy with mild carbonation. Sugary, but not cloyingly so. Caramel, vanilla and toffee sweetness; mineral bitterness. Lengthy, moderately sweet finish. Thanks to StFun for shipping the growler to me! 
"
1," dark brown black color some frothy beige head, good lacing, nose is big espresso, and roasted malt, med body nice mouthfeel kinda coating, nice roasted malts some coffee choc flavor, somewhat bittersweet. nice stout.
"
1," bottle; brown hazy with medium tan head; aroma-yeast, fruits and floral... something spicy/pepper; taste-mild sweetness, moderate carbonation and bitter reminiscent of some barleywine. Hard to say if I prefer Red or Blue...Red for aroma
"
1," This is my first trappist brew, and whoa what a alcohol kick, great color, bubbly head, and the complex malty taste came through better after it warmed. A must have!
"
1," Poured a dark brown with loads of gorgeous, creamy tan head that thinned but never actually left.  Spice aroma, flavor with some sweetness and malts making up the major parts.  Just a quality beer.
"
1," JAN 28, 2009 Appearance is murky brown with a fine foam head of about 10% the height of the rest of the beer.  The correct temperature certainly brings out the best parts of this beer.  I brought home the bottle and placed it in my fridge for a little less than an hour before drinking, and this proved to be perfect.  Wonderfully creamy with hints of yeast, caramel, and just a little metallic carbonation.  Underneath the surface, theres a feeling of incredible clarity that lasts in the middle of the tongue.  All in all, a great experience.
"
1," This is one of my favorites, had it before dinner.  Fragrant aroma of sweet citrus, not tangy citrus.  Nice head, bubbles are very large. Body is kinda thin, but explodes with flavor on your tongue, almost chirstmas spices and friut, but underlying. the giant bubbles only help awaken your sleeping tounge.  		750 ml bottle, 5 months old
"
1," Bottle. Low fluffy and lasting light brown head. Clear dark brown body. Roasted malt caramel coffee aroma. Slightly sour coffee berries roasted malt flavor . Low carbonation. Long aftertaster.
"
1," 0.33 l bottle (2009).	Deep dark brown coloured brew with a creamy, finger thick beige head on its top and sediments at the bottom of my chalice.	Smell of dark fruits and yeast.	Tiny sharp start, complex flavour of caramell, cherry and raisins, mouthfeel is thick.	The (also) complex and robustly malt-dominated aroma brings caramell, belgian yeast, citrus and spice (cinnamon) along.	The finish is moderate bitter, spicy, citric and alcohol is warming up, at last a dried fruity-spicy aftertaste remains.	Full bodied, but the alcohols well hidden, its just slightly sensible.	A very fine trappist stuff.
"
1," This is truly and Irish Red. Very true to style!  Malty with a hop bit and smooth
"
1," Dark appearnace but lighter than expected flavour, high alcohol content, goes down a treat
"
1," on tap-pours a white head and hazy yellow color.  Aroma is sweet light malt/wheat.  Taste is sweet light malt/wheat, hint of hops.  Mild carbonation.  Nice.
"
1," Dutch ratebeer meeting. Clear light-yellow coloured. Sweet, thin and cheap.
"
1," Poured dark brown with a tan head. Aroma, coffee, chocolate, roasted malts. Flavor, coffee, chocolate, an odd sweetness, kinda thin.
"
1," JAN 22, 2008 750 ml bottle - pours a cloudy auburn with a gauzy head - you have to be really careful with the pour, especially if youre not using the proper glassware - otherwise its 90% head for a good while.  Aroma not as yeasty as I was expecting, more notes of pear and even peach.  Full-flavoured and fruity.  Flavours blossom in the mouth as the beer warms from its initial cellar temperature.  Long, dry, and slightly sour finish.  Nice.  Had this one back to back with a Westmalle dubbel, which was superior, at least  to my tastes.  Nonetheless, the Chimay Rouge is a beautiful beer.
"
1," Screaming applesauce at me this has a very sweet nose. Pours a reddish murky brown with some white head the lasted. Wonderful carbonation that was champagne like and refreshing. Medium body and a very crisp finish. Flavor to me was all apple and I liked it. The finish at a slight alcohol warming but not enough to ruin it. I can get some plum and raisins out it and I really did not feel that it was too sweet. Overall I could really chill out with this brew many times
"
1," Bottle. Nice big tan head with excellent duration. Color is dark brown. Aroma is sweet with lots of spices. Taste is sweet with some alcohol. Good mouthfeel.
"
1," Hazy yellow with a white head. Aroma is sweet, malty, wheaty and fruity. Flavor is medium sweet. Sweet finish. 021011
"
1," Port-like aroma, slight vinegar notes, yeast and fruit, chocolate notes. Seems more robust as it warms up. Pours a very opaque brown, cloudy, head is thin. Pleasantly sweet, chocolate comes in again, alcohol. Maybe some roast/smoked flavours. An interesting beer.
"
1," Big pop of the cork coming off. Yeast smell hit right away.  Poured as careful as I could to keep the floaties out, but several still made it into my glass. Brownish red color, little head, probably because I poured it so slowly. Spicy with a terrific malt. Alcohol burn on my lips, not in the taste.  I liked the Red better, and I look forward to the White.
"
1," Had in 12 oz.bottle and wasnt impressed but wasnt disastisfied. Has a tangourine taste sorry if I mispelled that other other orange word a citrus brew thats sour but doesent last and sweet characteristics.
"
1," Cloudy amber with a large off white head. Sweet aroma with toasted malt, caeramel, wheat and banana. Cloying sweet flavour with toasted malt, caramel, sweet rotten banana and wheat. Awfull.
"
1," The smell of fermented honey is balanced nicely with estery hop notes.  This ale is clear, with a light, golden color, reminiscent of a pilsener-style lager.  Upon tasting, the honey makes its presence known, followed by a slight hop bitterness.  The finish is clean.  This ale seems to please the domestic-beer drinkers and the geeks as well.
"
1," 12 oz bottle.  Pours a clear bright copper body under a fizzy off white head.  Minimal to no visible carbonation, and lots of sticky lacing.  The aroma hops are very leafy and earthy smelling with a slight tea like quality.  Minimal malt impact.  The flavor is very earthy and quite bitter with a moderate toasted malt base.  Nice lingering bitter finish.  Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with a moderate fizzy carbonation level.  A pretty nice drinkable IPA.
"
1," Bottle shared by EDA. Very vegetal, simple sugars, watermelon, kind of interesting and complex. Pours like fizzy soda pop. Crunchy, chewy, lettuce flavor, very dry, a touch of belgian yeast. Not bad.
"
1," 12 twist off bottle, purchased somewhere in Lake Okoboji, Iowa, enjoyed on the boat. Pour is a darker copper, mostly clear with a one inch light tan head. Aroma is resin, caramel malt and a pleasant earthiness. Taste is nice bitter, resin, touch of dank hops along with a significant caramel malt backbone. Clean. The palate is medium bodied, dry resinous finish. Nice one.
"
1,"  Cask Conditioned, @ the Pigs Ear Festival London.  Dark with a mahogany trim. Has no head. Dark but empty, theres no much malt or toast to go with the colour. If you wait long enough though, there is a really late bitter kicker.
"
1," A dark almost mahogany pour this beer really looks good. I only picked up malt on the aroma, I expected spices but nothing was there. A sweet malty flavor. A clean bitter finish. It was a tad over carbonated or fizzy for my taste. A good beer but just not as spicy as I expected.
"
1," Very cloudy and brown with a light head that dissipates quickly after being dense initially. Hard to smell due to my congestion, but I did detect a fruity presence and some caramel. Slightly malty intro with a smooth sweet transition to a somewhat warming, mildly bitter finish.
"
1," Brown, with active carbonation leading to a creamy head.  In each catagory, I like to find a beer that exemplifies the style, and for Belgians, it is Chimay Bleu.  Pleasant aroma, nice malty flavor, with hints of  the fruity yeast flavors.
"
1," Pours dark brown with a moderately sized, foamy head. Smells of alcohol and malt. Very warm flavor, mildly sweet. Flavors of cherry, pear, and berries come forward.
"
1," dark in color with a reddish hue to it. Got it at Mahars. White head some lace. Smells fruity, darker fruits like raisins. Real nice beer, nice and smooth, if you can find it, try it.
"
1," Pours dirty brown, big off white head that dissapears quickly. Aroma of spices, alcohol, cherry and roastiness. Trois Pistoles with cayanne and way more chocolate and fig/plums. Raisins, red wine. Malty, sour, and very good.
"
1," light bread, light sulfor, light metallic, light eeg. Taste"
1," 12 oz. bottle. I get to give this one its ranking among other beers! And in this competitive style, it does hold its own. Big piney hop aroma from the time I pop the cap. Pours a pleasing orangey IPA color, with the carbonation surging into a fluffy head that shortly dissolves to lacing. Pretty clear until you spot the microscopic Bells-type floaties. Taste to my mind is again more of big resiny pine boughs than citrus. But still, its very tasty and filling, and brings out the malts, which appear to be a tad darker in roast than other IPA, a bit more caramel and over-toasted bagel. Its very enjoyable, and distinctive, especially for a bottled IPA. My label says ""Tavern style India Pale Ale."" I have never found a tavern with anything this good.
"
1," Amost always the best beer you can find when you find it. Its mocha and berry character are so beautiful and its musty yeast strain is one of a kind.
"
1," Bottle thanks to blutt50. Orange pour, soapy head. Dark fruity aroma, with clove, cinnamon and spice. Flavor is white pepper, bready yeast, esters, and bananas.
"
1," JUN 17, 2010 pours an opaque, dark brown with a creme colored head. Aroma is heavy with malt and yeast. Flavor is loaded with sweet malt and beer is well hopped. The 9% alcohol is hidden in the sweetness. Finishes with a taste of ripe bananas, especially after the beer warms a little.
"
1," Cask, Blackfriars, Inverness. Had just a couple hours in Inverness between buses (not nearly long enough--what a pretty city), but Blackfriars is all of five minutes walk from the bus station, so I did have time for a couple of pints.		Pleasantly surprised to see something strongish on the tap list. A very dark copper, slight haze, small fine off-white layer of head. Rich gingerbread aroma, nice butter touch, a little hay. Flavor has a full Christmas pudding malt richness, ginger and cinnamon, some dried figs. The finish is surprisingly dry and clean, with just a little lingering grape skin. After a fairly long string modest and forgettable pints, this beer makes me very pleased. Extravagant and generous, rather than elegant or delicate. Just what I needed to fortify me for the long ride back South...
"
1," 33cl bottle. Pours dark brown with a slight chocolate head. The ale smelled of raisins, earth, dates and dark fruits. The beer tasted of well blended dark fruits and yeast. It finished with a dry spanish ceder and nutmeg feel. It felt full but rounded with a sense of smoothness. Overall the beer was complete and reminded me of something timeless
"
1," I really really like this beer. I drank it out of a wine glass, just as they said to. Nice head and great taste, not for those who like weak beer with flavors that disappear quickly. The taste lingered in my mouth and made me want MORE.
"
1," Had this beer once a few years ago. Wasnt into the stronger dark beers at the time, but surprisingly liked this beer. Its no wonder it is one of the top rated.
"
1," Black color with a dark tan head.  Slightly watery body (or maybe I just picky).  Decent, but average oatmeal stout.
"
1," Atlanta. On tap at Rock Bottom Restaurant and Brewery in Buckhead.  Brewed by Big River Breweries, centered in Chattanooga.  Well, this sure is a pretty good marzen.  While, it doesnt compare to Spaten and Sam Adams, I would probably name this as my third favorite marzen, which are some of my favorite bees.  It tastes a bit watery in comparison to those two and not quite as complex.  Hints of caramel and malt make it nice as we round out the Oktoberfest season.  Seems to be a typical marzen, really, not much special.
"
1," Bottle. Pours a dark brown color with a small tan head. Has a roasted malty woody aroma with hints of chocolate. Roasted malty smooth chocolate and bourbon flavor. Has a roasted malty chocolate and bourbon finish.
"
1," Fine dark reddish colour, but the head is dissapointing. Spicy, malty and sweet aroma. The taste is quite complex, but the maltiness and sweetness is very (perhaps too) remarkable.
"
1," Bottle at GBBF 2007.  Deep chestnut with lasting beige head.  Its a goodish, slightly choccy beer.  Decent carbonation and hop finish. Its fine, if dull.  Not a dunkel, not very schwarzey either.  Thin.
"
1," always tastes better from the big bottles.  and usually not that expensive relative to the other trappist darks
"
1," 	Good chunky head that eventually settles to a thin film and lasts very well. It has some of the heaviest lace you will see. As you tip the glass to sip it leaves behind a solid covering of tan foam with no breaks in it at all. Lovely! Sweet alcoholic nose with some rice pudding. Metailc (but in a good way), vanilla and strong caramel and cream is the order of the day flavour wise. Then it is all rounded off with and very long and amazing caramel and marzipan finish with some gradual alcohol warming. Glorious stuff. Make sure it is not over chilled, it will totally kill it and be careful with the sediment if its not your thing then I would suggest a gentle pour and pay attention. Grande Reserve variant is even better.
"
1," Bottle, 5.5%. Clear dark brown colour. Stable tan head. The flavour starts off with a weak spicy note, brunkage, cardamum/cinnamon. Roasted finish, hint of grain. Clean.
"
1," 12oz via trade a ways back.  Pours black with a light brown head.  Nose is sweet with big coffee notes.  Taste is sweet and slightly chocolaty.  It is just ok.
"
1," MMMMMMM now this is nice.  Pours a deep amber color with a small head.  Flavor is wonderful with hints of malt and yeast.  Aroma is yeasty and very nice indeed.
"
1," 0.33l bottle	earthy aroma, brown hazy appearance, slightly bitter and not strong taste and with a sticky medium body and long finish

1," Bottle from Tesco poured into a Westmalle glass.  Very dark red, with a well formed and generous head.  Tastes fruity, slightly sweet, its a little less comples a brew than I was expecting.	The aroma is rich, hoppy and fruity, nice.  Nice on the palate, though not as good as the Blaauw.
"
1," DEC 25, 2003 Tried both the 1998 & 2002 330ml bottles side by side. Aroma malt, alcohol, lightly yeasty and a tiny hint of metal. 2002 bottle has also has some floral in the aroma whereas the 1998 bottle had more malt aroma and less apparent alcohol. Both murky red/brown not seethrough thanks to the great amount of yeast that comes in the bottle. Both bottles had heads that slowly began slowly creeping out of the bottles although they were treated very gently. Both have great malty flavours with a hint of roastiness, mocha, plums and a strong alcohol flavour which improves the feel of the beer. 1998 beer was smoother. Both are higher carbonated that I would have thought (and at the same level) but it doesn't detract. They drink with heaps of mouthfeel!
"
1," Poured an amber color ale with a large foamy head with average retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of dry caramel malt with light dry hops as well. Taste is dominated by not overly complex dry caramel malt with very little hops apparent. Body is about average with good carbonation. Standard pale ale with little character but no flaws as well.
"
1," I found the nose a bit odd--kind of smelly-sneaker like--but this didnt really detract from this great beer. Very fruity, with a slight bitterness and well-balanced spice flavors. The flavor of alcohol was strong, but not overpowering.
"
1," OCT 10, 2006 11.2 oz.  Inevitably pours with a creamy persistent foam.  Modest, yet refined aroma of plums and maraschino.  Hints of cotton candy, pepper, and leather in there as well.  Medium body.  Watery middle reminiscent of cherry Kool-Aid.  Straightforward flavors of white grape, cantaloupe, fig, and slick cherry-like malt.  Only the slightest hint of toastiness in the mostly hop/yeast finish.  Sadly, this has become a run of the mill dubbel and doesnt begin to reach complexity.  I also hold much higher standards for the Trappists.  Ill take my Allagash Dubbel any day over this.
"
1," Bottle. Nice light red-brown colour. BIg short lasting head. Sweet aroma. Port, malt , yeast. The taste is booth fruity and dry. Sweet caramel. I think this beer is a little thin for so many and complicated flavours. Elegant but not great.
"
1," Corked and caged bottle. Cork marked 11/04. Mostly lasting large sized ivory head with many different sized bubbles, decent lacing, transparent, carbonated, and a reddish brown hue. Malty, caramel, hoppy, and alcohol nose. Flavor was absolutely delectable - sweet, malty, caramel, light roastiness, and vinuous. My kind of brew!!  Mostly smooth palate. Medium body.  A very drinkable BSA and definitely worthy of a try especially if one enjoys a good BSA.
"
1," Bottle, 33 cl. Hazy dark brown colour with a medium tan head. Fruity, yeasty aroma. Sweet, fruity flavour with figs & raisins. Warm sweet finish.
"
1," I dont know if I got a bad bottle or what, but I only drank about a third of this and had to pour it out. Was a small bottle.	To bitter for my tastes, not what I was expecting. I usually agree with the ratings on here but...I just dont like this one..	Blue = good	Red = icky
"
1," Originally designed as an IPA, this pale ale has a mellow, yet full hop aroma.  The color is almost amber, but not too dark.  It develops a nice head, which could be slightly heavier.  This ale is extremely drinkable, but pleases at each sip; characteristic of a good english pub ale.  The IPA origin of this beer is evident in its hop profile.  This beer also finishes clean, and is best after warming a little.
"
1," Near black colour with a big head.  Quite fizzy, obscuring some chocolatey accents.  Mainly malty with light chocolate but I cant move past the fizz (I never can).
"
1," Amber brown colour, big head, a little fizzy, long aftertaste.
"
1," Pours a dark redish-brown; big head.  Not much of an aroma, but its eventful, with a complex flavor cycle of alcohol notes, malt sweetness and smooths out quite nicely with some hints of chocolate (?).  Not my favorite, but its definetly a beer of quality.
"
1," Nice hard color and small finger width light head.  Smells slightly sweet.  Goes down smooth and leaves an incredible aftertaste and almost forces you to take another sip.  Too bad it goes away quickly.
"
1," 100th rating (I knew I shouldve saved the Westvleteren for this...).  Smells of fruit and spices, and pours a beautiful deep brown with an off-white head.  Taste is smooth, with nut, fruit, and malt characteristics prominent.  By far the class of the Chimay offerings and a wonderful beer in its own right.
"
1," From the tap poured a clear golden color with lots of head.  Smooth with a quick finish.
"
1," Taste can be better.  Great colour!

1," Draft at Rock Bottom Charlotte. Pours a light brown color with a small off white head. Nose is sweet and lightly spicy with a nutty note and some caramel. Palate is tingly with a dry finish. Light nuts and caramel malt notes in the flavor.
"
1," Pours golden with a fully receding white head. Notes of pear, bubble gum, honey, and pale malt. Medium bodied with soft carbonation. An enjoyable beer, despite the poor head retention.
"
1," 0.75L bottle (2010). Pours deep-earth brown with thick tan head that stays the course of the drink. Sweet scents permeate the glass, a touch of spice and pastures. The taste is malty, somehow sweet and yet roast/caramel flavor punctuates the undertones. A pleasant aftertaste lingers - reminds me of my first trip to Belgium.
"
1," Very good, quite similar to the blue other than alcohol content and milder taste.  Very good, silky, rich dark robust flavor, complex taste that obviously took some time to perfect. Awesome overall, love the dark rich sweet flavor with a hint of spiceiness on the aftertaste. The tongue is covered in delicious dark beer then subsides and then you drink another. 	The blue and red are a favorite for cooking savory dishes and certain cheeses.
"
1," Poured a dark, cloudy caramel/molasses color with a thin beige head. The head disappeard to just a film rather quickly. The aroma was of toffee, raisins, dried fruits and some alcohol. There was good carbonation on the initial taste. The texture was lightly creamy/silky. Initially the flavor was slightly tart with maybe the flavor of cherries and then mellowed into more of a sweet flavor of the roasted malts with flavors of raisins and toffee. The finish was rather mellow and mild on the palate.
"
1," Bottled. Golden colour, small head. Aroma is strong malts, some biscuits and hops. Flavour is much the same. Mild spices as well.
"
1," FEB 19, 2003 Springfield, PA. Darkish copper colored, with no head -	probably poured like that on purpose.	Served inappropriately at about 40 deg	F.  This beer was cold.  It tasted	fine at that temp but I had to let it warm up 	for awhile.  It was worth the wait, as a	very interesting and complex character developed.	Very phenolic and funky - with a strong ester of	bubblegum.  Also a little clove or some kind of 	spice.  Strong but not overwhelming at all.  Surpisingly	easy to drink.
"
1," Hand-pump at Sailor HagarsCloudy golden color; nice creamy head. Light fruity aroma. Low carbonation, smooth mouthfeel, good malt and blond caramel flavor, correct bitterness, with hints of hop qualities; shades of toffee in the end. Highly drinkable session beer.
"
1," Courtesy of Fonefan. Its golden with an Ok head. The aroma is malty and slightly perfumed fruity. The flavour has sweetness and notes of malt, caramel, light spicy and perfumed fruit, and it ends on a dry note.
"
1," Pours murky brown with a white head that left a thin lacing on the glass and a film on the beer.  Aroma is very pleasant and smells of sweet fruit.  Intial taste is sweet and fruity with a moderate alcohol character.  Leaves a clean taste in the mouth.  Not as layered as Westvleteren 12, but a damn fine drink nonetheless.
"
1," Clear golden color with a small white head.  Aroma is grains with some caramel.  I not really liking the aroma here.  Taste is bread, slight fruitiness, touch of a caramel.  Nice balance to the flavor here.  Pretty light bodied.  Better than I had expected.  Thanks atom!
"
1," FEB 10, 2008 Bottle acquired in trade with Atpayne (thanks Adam). Slick black color and a light brown head. Taste is of mellow oak, vanilla, milk chocolate and roasted malts. Oatmeal is hardly noticeable. Mouthfeel is smooth and almost full bodied. Bourbon flavor is more in the finish along with mellow bitterness. A freakin well done beer.
"
1," This beer suffers greatly from being pushed into a popular style without the necessary features.  As an IPA, this brew is an underhopped bummer.  As a regular American Pale Ale, it fares much, much better.  Unfortunately, its been declared an IPA, so I have to rate it as such.  And the results are very average.  The flavor has a deep malt vein that runs underneath, which proves too much for the mild hops (mild, of course, being relative.)   The hops are apparent, piney with a hint of citrus, but the malts trounce any blossoming IPA-dom.  This beer would probably rate in the mid-3s as a APA.  As it is, blah.  So just ignore their signs and treat it as a regular Pale.
"
1," Bottle. It pours a clear, golden body and a small, white head on top. Grainy and lightly fruity aroma with a touch of grass and hay. Thin on the palate, with a pleasant carbonation. The flavor is slightly better, with a nice bitterness, else its grains and a fruity touch. Overall, the only thing I like about this one is the bitterness. 111127

1," This is my favorite beer of all time. And I have had numerous! It satisfies all seasons, all moods, all moments. I am one of those weird individuals that could pair this beer with any food, at any time. May our LORD & Savior Jesus Christ bless the soul of Father Theodore- may his soul rest in Heaven!

1," The Dan Journal #83.  Tasted 4/30/2007.  12oz bottle.  Inky brown hue.  Webbed beige head.  Chocolate brownies and oatmeal sweet malty aromas.  Full bodied and big with nice chocoalte sweet malts.  Good roast with mild bitterness.  Bready brownie flavors.  Nice flavors.

1," Large bottle, hazy orange pour in the customary Chimay glass with distinctive head and lacing.  NIce pleasant aroma.  Subtly sweet on the pallet with touch of hops with grains and a distinctive yeast character.  Some bitterness and alc. bite but well balanced overall.
"
1," pours amber with a descent white bubbly head and descent lacing. aroma and flavor are light malt and citrus pine hops. mouthfeel is kind of watery. I have had better pales, but you can slam a crap load oof these. very sessionable and a good gateway beer.
"
1," Poured into a snifter. Appearance is a murky brown with a thin offwhite head that dissipates pretty quickly. Goods lacing. Aroma is malts and dried fruits. Taste is malty with hints of nuts and caramel. Super creamy feel on the tongue. This beer is very nice and I am glad to make it my first rated dubbel.
"
1," AWESOME STRONG BEER WITH A GREAT COLOR AND A NICE HEAD.  NOT TO OVERPOWERING JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF BITTERNESS
"
1," From a 750 ml corked bottle.  A murky purplish-brown color with a fizzy champagne like head that dissipated within seconds after pouring.  Fizzy champagne like carbonation too.  Nose of plumbs, prunes, and some floral notes.  Fizzy, like champagne, on the palate.  Plum and prune in the taste.  With the prune like taste and the fizzy carbonation, I could not help thinking of ""Dr. Pepper"" (the soft drink) as I was drinking it.  I cant decide if thats good or bad.  A decidedly noticeable alcohol taste too, and an alcohol finish.
"
1," JUN 15, 2008 Poured a cloudy amber color with white frothy head.  Yeasty aroma with cotton candy? Nice compliment of sublte favors.  Smooth.  Initial yeast taste with a hop aftertaste.  Didnt seem fruity as described.  Full taste with a very soft bitter aftertaste.  I do prefer the Red and Blue but nice beer.
"
1," Dark brown colour.Thick and lasting creamy head. Notes of raisin, dark fruits and malts. Carabonation is sprinkly. Good full body. Complex Belgium. Long end.
"
1," Redish-brown,fruity, a classic no one can deny,its biggest problem is its name,never meets its expectations nor can it live up to its big brother Blue.
"
1," Bottle 500ml.Unclear hazy medium orange yellow color with a large, frothy to creamy, good lacing, mostly lasting, white to off-white head. Aroma is light to moderate malty, citrus, moderate yeasty, fruity, banana, clove, citrus acidic. Flavor is moderate sweet and light citrus fruity acidic with a long to average duration, sharp. Body is medium, texture is oily, carbonation is soft. [20100613]
"
1,")  I have been wanting to try this stuff for a long time, and I am greatly pleased with it! It pours a darker amber, with fluffy tan head. Not much of an aroma, but the flavor is off the charts. Very nicely sweet raisin, and plum flavors, with a hint of vanilla and a nicely warming finish. Great first impression from this brewery. Cheers!
"
1," ABR 2007.  A black pour with brown head.  The nose was a little light for on oatmeal stout, but the body was pretty solid oatmeal with fain coffee hints.
"
1," Bottle from pivnizub, many thanks. Dark brown color with huge white head. Nice lacing. Fruity aroma, with some spices, some sourness. Taste, wheat, banana, orange, clove.  Spicy, bittersweet finish. Nice.
"
1," MAR 28, 2011 Pretty hazy, ruby pour. Had several different sweet notes in the taste, with a hint of bitterness on the finish. Excellent. 4.5	RE-RATE 3/28/11 Bottle from World Market.  This beer pours a lightly cloudy amber red, rich with orange highlights.  There is a nice smooth white head that doesnt disappear.  It gets fairly murky towards the top of the glass.		Man I could smell this beer from way above the glass.  All good things though!  It has a very yeasty smell, even though I saved the yeast dregs at the bottom of the bottle and saved them for my homebrew.  There is a nice dark fruit aroma as well, such as black cherries or tart plum.  Very nice.		The flavor is immediately lightly tart, which reminds me of grape juice.  A nice touch of sweet flavors from the fruitiness also fill in well.  It finishes with a yeasty dryness that doesnt linger longer than need be.  The alcohol begins to be tasted at warmer temperatures, but only in the slightest.		Man this is good beer.  The Belgians know how to do it!  Well I guess technically the monks dont since they took a vow of chas....you know what, never mind.  Enjoy the beer and leave me to enjoy mine.
"
1," Bottle 33cl. Pours dark amber with a thin white creamy head. Aroma is yeast and fruits. Very good texture. Flavor is malty and fruity. Complex. Peppery yeastness in the end.

1," (Bottle 50 cl) Courtesy of MoritzF. Clear golden with a white head. Fresh and floral nose. Medium body with solid, sweet malts and a dry, lightly hoppy finish. Very fresh. 140308
"
1," Smaller bottle, poured into Chimay goblet. Pours mostly clear reddish-brown. The head fizzes away fairly quickly, leaving a bald spot of foam. Yeasty aroma. Somewhat light-bodied with prickly fizz, the flavor is yeasty, slightly spicy, and fruity...more berries than darker fruits. Plays out as the most summer-y of the Chimays, but that doesnt mean it lacks depth.
"
1," Bottle. Golden colour with a white head. aroma is fruit, berries. Flavour is fruit, berries, flower, herbs. Thin body. Weird beer.
"
1," The Dan Journal #77.  Tasted 4/5/2007.  12oz bottle.  Murky light brown hue.  Ring of white head.  Toasty caramel aromas with notes of cocoa nutty and a touch of soy.  Medium bodied with a syrupy grainy cocoa woody flavor.  Short lived, replaced by an acidic metallic flavor.  Finish is fumbled and citrusy.  Meh...
"
1," Got a bottle of this as a gift today, I usually skip right over the Red and the White for the Blue.  Poured a nice deep red color, head is initially quite strong but it shrinks quickly.    Yeasty spicy flavor.
"
1," haha The beer head started foaming up out of the bottle before I even started pouring it.  It had a white head of finely sized white bubbles coming out of the bottle!  After I poured it into my bug, it formed a large invigorated head of finely sized white bubbles that lasted a good length of thime.  Its body was a cloudy yeasty brown color and its aroma was that of a very mild, dare I say hotstuff influencenced me, vomit.  Thanks Hotstuff for the thought.  Fortunately the flavor was a bit better.  The flavor contains notes of alcohol, spices, caramel malt and molasses.  The mouthfeel is tingly and smooth.  If only it smelled better!
"
1," Pours a deep amber/burgundy color with a nice amount of froathy whitish head.  Sweet raisiny and brown sugar flavor, but smooth and not as pronounced as others Ive had.  Aroma is sweet and flowery with a yeast/raisin undertone.  Overall, I felt this was a very enjoyable beer, but I think I liked the red a wee bit better.
"
1," On tap at Sailor Hagars. Pours a solid amber with creamy white head that lasts to the bottom of the glass. Aroma has pine and grapefruit/citrus hop notes. Flavour is also very hoppy but with enough toffee malt character to balance it out. Lingering bitterness. Decent but a tad underwhelming.
"
1," Pours Hazy brown, with a tall whote head, Aroma is strong and yeasty with notes of dark fruits and breads. Very rich bready flavour, Complex and fruity, strong flavour of Belgian yeast, with an alcoholic finish. Great Belgian Ale. I love trapist!

1," Brown pour thin tan head, and some spotty lace.  Nutty aroma.  Flavor is overly metallic, nuts and sour malts

1," Hazy yellow color with big suspended sediments of yeast. Fresh yeasty nose, some grain, some hops. Flavor is yeatsy too, yeasty, hints of sweetness, hop bitterness and grain.

"
1," Bottle 330ml @ fonefan	Pours clear pale yellow with a white head. Aroma has notes of lime, grape and citrus. Taste is like a spicy raddler. Body is light, texture is thin, carbonation is soft.
"
1," Courtesy Quake1028.  Pours a cloudy orange, with a small white head.  Smells of toasted malts, some caramel, and not really much semblance of hops.  Definitely smells old.  The flavor has a tiny hop presence, but the malts are most dominant as this definitely has some age to it.  Would have liked to have it fresher and will revisit it again if I get the chance.  The malts and toasted caramel are the most dominant flavor, and it probably sholdnt be that way.
"
1," Bottle @ Autumn Tasting, Ulfborg 2011. Pours hazy golden with a lasting egg white head. Paper, banana, wheat and corn. Thin body. A bit watery. Short end.
"
1," Bottle. Clear gold, average white head. Sweet biscuity aroma, lightly toasty. Sweet corny lager flavours, a little buttery, a little caramel. Too sweet for me to enjoy more than one.
"
1," Pours amber with suspended bits of yeast and a nice creamy layer of off-white head. Clean soapy aroma with some peppery spice and a hint of dates. Mmmm. What a wonderful palate. Those crafty monks have done it again. Light, clean, very delicate. My mouth is blissfully unaware of the ABV. Toasty carmel, toffee and plum flavors with a dry clean finish.
"
1,"  Dirty Helen Tavern Style Brown Ale is brown in color with golden highlights and a thin, speckly veil.  A faint caramelly-molasses-nutty aroma is barely evident.  The flavor is even more elusive which is okay based on what can be found which includes"
1," Pours dark hazy amber with incredible lacing and modest head. Aroma primarily of beligian yeast, and lemongrass. Flavor is well balanced and fufilling while still maintaining a high level of drinkability. Great flavor, great mouthfeel, and great aroma- great offering by Chimay.
"
1," Enjoyed this one during my visit to Oklahoma.  Aromas of dark fruits and what I call ""buttery brown sugar"" with some caramel.   Dark amber in color with a nice off-white head.  More of the darker fruits and a some of roasted caramel.  Sweet, with some warming bitterness in the finish.  The flavor didnt live up to the aroma in my opinion. Creamy, full mouthfeel.
"
1," The blue one is the best belgian beer I ever tasted. Some friends in Liege teach to me how to enjoy this graet beer in ""La Voudree"", togheter with good meat. Aroma is really special, and we can talk about this beer like about a good red wine
"
1," 75 cl bottle - first time trying Chimay;pours cloudy amber getting more thick by the end; spicy aromas are the strongest; drinks full, smooth and almost creamy texture; malty aftertaste
"
1," Deep crimson with a watery head.  Really watery beer.  Sour mash is the first tone I sense.  Bit of a sweet caramel, I guess.  But this is slightly flavored water, is all.
"
1," Rich yeasty aroma.  Deep red colour with large foamy head.  Great malty taste with mild yeasty flavours.  Fantastic beer with a great complexity and hints of orange and pear.  Great stuff!
"
1," Hand-pump at Sailor HagarsBrown color, creamy head. Light caramel and very light butterscotch aroma. The body is weaker than expected, there is caramel flavor, low bitterness. The hand-pump allows for lower carbonation, which is better for me. Simple but easy to drink
"
1," Bottle. Pours a clear golden color. White head. Aroma is a nasty fuckin sour grain. Awful smell. Stings the nostrils. Flavor is sour and gross. WTF did people drink before prohibition?!?? What the hell.
"
1," 0.3l bottle.very strong. to be sipped slowly.	too much carbonation for me.	gets more pleasent when left warm a bt and less carbonation.	Dont understand the ""superbeer"" classification.
"
1," It seems that as the whole barrel aging thing catches on more and more there are more and more lighter beers being aged in bourbon barrels and normally not to good effect. The problem is bourbon barrels impart a rather strong flavor and it takes a heck of a beer to stand up to that treatment. This particular beer is dark and nearly headless. A smack of tartness greets the nose initially and fades to a more vanilla-centric bourbon character. The flavor, too, is somewhat tart and cherry-like but really only mildly so. Again, the bourbon barrel character here is somewhat dominant w/ a bit of vanilla and some coconut. Whats missing I would say is much real porter character but, still, I would say this is much better than many other lighter barrel aged beers.
"
1," Bottle looks simple, but good. Beer in the glass dark, not black. Malty-alcoholic aroma. Starts heavy-malty, intense, again a bit alcoholic-soapy, fruity like raisins. Finish warming, well balanced, but still a bit too alcoholic. Good beer, but not more.
"
1," I had a 2001 Vintage at Kulminator in Antwerp.  I really think these need to be aged for a while to get the residual sugar out.  If you can hold out for five years this beer will turn into something that is so good it will take you an hour to drink.  Or, you can funnel it in 5 seconds.  Your call.
"
1," One of the best beers ive tried so far. I tried in in Belgium and on first sip I already fall in love with it ;)
"
1," Bottle 500ml. w. swing top.Unclear medium to dark red brown color with a average to large, frothy, good lacing, mostly lasting, off-white head. Aroma is light to moderate malty, caramel, moderate yeasty, banana, phenol and toffee notes. Flavor is moderate to heavy sweet and light to moderate bitter with a average to long duration, caramel. Body is medium, texture is oily, carbonation is soft. [20101015]
"
1," Bottle. Pour is a very murky light brown. Despite best efforts there is heaps of floating sediment. Resonable slightly off white head that disappears pretty quickly. Aroma is quite sweet with plenty of malt and toffee aromas. Also some alcohol and spiceness and perhaps a little dired fruti. Flavours once again shows heaps of malt sweetness, especially up front, toffee, caramale and spicness. A little thin on the finish with some alcohol coming through. A good beer but probably not as great as I remember it from a couple of years ago.
"
1," Hazy copper pour with foamy off-white head. The beer looks thick and feels thick and has a decent balance between bittering hops and sweet malts. Citrus aromas of grapefruit with notes of pine and flowers. Some caramel in the background. The flavor is moderately bitter and lightly sweet. Thick mouthfeel and lively carbonation. Finish is bitter. A bit too full-bodied for my taste in an IPA, but certainly ejoyable enough nonetheless.
"
1," Assertive, yet balanced, woody bitterness.
"
1," An alright pale ale but I didnt find it to be very bitter, it was more fruity, with citrus and some spice.

1," Another high-class Abbey Dubbel beer. A beautifully creamy head and brownish body. Ummm

1," Bottled. Hazy dark brown body middel head. A bit smoked and a good toffefee flavor. God belgian strong ale.

1," FEB 18, 2006 Pours a beautiful dark brown with a creamy, tan long-lasting head. Very appealing aroma and complex taste. Very smooooooth finish.
"
1," assertively wheaty, estery, but with a mixture of lemony citrus and earthy coconut nuances. Quite appealing really. Flavours of tart lemony wheat with subtle background coconut. Not toasty really, more like young green coconut, and not in-your-face. The coconut is subtle but definitely part of the palate. I was quite happy with this one; the BeerMaster series from these guys is fun and interesting.
"
1," Timing is everything. This pours to a deep, opaque balck, with a long thick long lasting tan head and excellent lacing. Aroma is very strongly coffee, toffee and chocolate. Flavor is more of the same.....and malty. Thick body, and rich, warm finish. I drank this on a hot summer day, yet rated it as if I were having it in late fall, on a cool night. A good beer in the right place and time.
"
1," 750ml bottle 	7.0% ABV 	I tried this beer on February 21st after purchasing from my local LCBO outlet.  The beer poured a reddish brown colour with a large, long lasting, rocky head.  The aroma was malty and yeasty with some hints of dark fruit.  The mouthfeel was full-bodied with mild carbonation.  The flavour was sweet matlt, with some yeast, and a small amount of bitterness.  A great beer.
"
1," JUL 5, 2005 Wow I found me some lost beer notes so here it goes... A dark amber color with a large head. Flavor is quite hoppy especially for a beer labeled an amber ale. A nice malt profile that makes this a very well balanced beer. Overall a good beer and its what a good session ale should taste like. Earlier Rating"
1," Draught @ Brauerei Wernsdorfer, Obere Bachgasse 5, Schonbrunn im Steigerwald, Bavaria, Germany 96185.Clear medium yellow orange color with a average, frothy to creamy, good lacing, mostly lasting, white head.

1," Cask conditioned - handpump - Market Porter Borough London.  A black beer with a thin slightly fruity aroma.  The taste has some light roast and a little fruit.  Unexciting but drinkable.
"
1," A great looking brew, but I didnt think it delivers all that it promises.  Malts are a nice toasty caramel, but maybe too much alcohol/astringency in the finish.
"
1," DEC 11, 2004 Oh my god, this is a wonderful beer. One sip and I immediately developed a deep appreciation for the monastic ways. The foamy tan head is rich and bubbly and while it dissipates quickly some excellent lacing is left behind. The gorgeous head sits on a deep brown body that is alive with effervescence. Has a sensational aroma of roasted malt, living yeast, alcohol, and blessed earth. Flavors of malt and yeast rush over the palate and ensnare the senses with heavenly delight while the sly 9% alcohol presence dances over the taste buds causing orgasmic convulsions at the back of the tongue. This beer made me positively giddy. With its fresh, robust aroma and peppery flavor plus its delightful eye appeal Chimay Bleu is certainly a gift from god. Oh Trappist Monks of Belgium, at long last, thank you blessed gentlemen, yours is truly the king of beers!
"
1," (swing top bottle, 33cl) Slightly hazy, pale golden colour with a fluffy white head. Sweet, slightly sugary pale malty aroma with notes of biscuits, grains and a tinge of herbal hops. Sweet flavour, medium to full bodied with a tame carbonation. Slightly sugary pale malt-character with biscuits and herbal notes, sweetish malty and faint bitter finish with restrained hops-character. Way too sweet for my liking. 16.12.09

1," bottle from el corte ingles, lisbon. Large dense head. Brown redish color. Medium sweetness. High caramel and malt aroma.

1," On tap @ Chattanooga.  Pours a mahogany black with a nice head and good lacing.  Big toasted malt aroma with some cocoa and coffee.  Taste is creamy and smooth with a good dose of semi-sweet chocolate and some coffee malts then a bit of hops and fruitiness.  This is the best of the Big River Brews - should be their Flagship Brand.  Very nice.
"
1," (300ml bottle thanks to Mora2000) clear, still with no coating or legs. Nose of maple, caramel and honey. Taste of alcohol, melon, and caramel. Thin body with an alcoholic finish.
"
1," Poured a dark reddish amber with a big off white head.  Fruity aroma of dark fruits, banana, some vinous character, light clove, and spices.  Flavor is fruity, but not very sweet, and malty.  Finsihes with spice and nice warming sensation.  Medium bodied.
"
1," 330ml bottle. Reasonable head that subsides slowly. Certainly an unusual aroma to this beer, somewhere between a malt cellar and a damp dog, though that isnt necessarily a bad thing. As for the taste, quite a deep earthy taste, lacking the bitter, fruity tang of some belgian beers; though again, this isnt a bad thing. Eminently drinkable with an almost caramelised aftertaste.

1," Pours with a medium sized, tan head that dissipates fairly quickly.  Dark, murky color, with light carbonation for some time after poured.  Full-bodied malty & yeasty taste with light spce and fruit.  Evident alcohol aftertaste, but it is not overpowering.  A classic Belgian strong ale.
"
1," very deep mahogony color, medium head with huge bubbles, full bodied and spicey, a nice hop bitterness and astringincy is present in the finish which follows the full yeasty, fruity main course
"
1," Draught.  Poured dark clear red brown with a medium beige head.  Moderate lacing.  Maple overtones in the aroma.  Roasty notes in the medium body, Just a tinge of maple sweetness. Roasty finish, with a hop edge that surprised me.
"
1," on tap-pours a light tan head and dark amber color.  Aroma is lots of sweet caramel, apple.  Taste is lots of sweet caramel, apple, back bone is hops.  Slick mouth feel.
"
1," Dont know how its rated a 100 but still good as hell. Has a great bubbly
"
1," Bottle. Clear gold. Aroma is sweet biscuit with light lime accents. Sweeter-than- average lager with caramel notes and lime, which thankfully is not overdone. Distinct dusty peppercorn note in the finish. This actually might be okay if the base beer was better.
"
1," Bottle. Copperred a bit unclear colour with large beige head. Ripe fruits in the aroma. Malty, fruity taste with light bitterness though. Long lasting aftertaste. Rich carbonation.
"
1," JAN 28, 2004 Out of a corked bottle, this beer had a large foamy head and a deep mahogany body.  Aroma of yeast, fruit.  Taste is amazing, alcoholic and floral.  Read someone else's rating for a better description than I am capable of.  All I can say is awesome!
"
1," Very let down with this one. I really enjoy Brass Knuckles, and liked the Bourbon Aged Oatmeal Stout. But, this one? Not so much. Very strong bourbon all around, in the aroma, the flavor, everything. The dark berries take a backseat, and the oatmeal isnt really noticeable at all. Texture is rich and creamy, but the bourbon is just too much.
"
1," Courtesy SoLan.  Pours dark brown, with a small off white head.  Smells a bit Belgian, some candy sugar, dark malts, and molasses make up the nose.  The flavor consists of some spices and a sweet malty presence.  Got a bit of graham cracker and caramel in there as well.  Kind of uniqu, but wasnt really getting me too exicted.  Certainly drinkable, but lacking a bit of something.
"
1," Bornze with an airy/foamy head of just the right size.  Feint malt and spice in the aroma. This lager has an easy moughtfeel with malt touches here and there. Rather nondescript in its malt flavor.  Smooth, but a bit flat.  An unspectacular beer, but could probably amass broad appeal to unrefined palates.
"
1,"	Pours a deep brown hue with ruby highlights around the edges topped by a frothy tan head and good lace. The aroma has notes of mocha, oats, caramel,  smoke, dusty yeast, floral hops, and a hint of bourbon esters. The taste starts malty sweet with noticeable oat and chocolate overtones before leading towards a vanilla and oaky midesection. The finish is bitter mostly from dark malts and sublime hopping. The feel is quite lively and aggressive, a tad overcarbonated and thin. Needs more oatmeal for body. Overall, I liked it but could see how others may be disappointed. The barrel aging is upfront and the feel is weak. With some tweeking, this beer could rock. I have only the one bottle but would pick up another or two for a rerate and trade if I can find it.
"
1," Light orange-brown, whitish cover.  Aroma is malty, sweet, orange zest note.  Taste is more malty sweetness, clean standard marzen.
"
1," Poured a hazy copper color.  Full Frothy head.  Yeasty flavors on the nose with some hops and slight fruit.  Med light bitter and light sweetness.  Finishes on the drier side.  This abbey dubbel is more bitter than most, but thats not a bad thing.  Not bad stuff.  The blue is by far the best chimay.
"
1," Pours an opaque dark brown.  One-finger off-white head that dissipates fairly quickly.  Complex aroma, with yeast and lots of fruit (tart cherry leading the way).  I agree with the rater below that the flavor doesnt quite live up to the aroma, but is still complex and good in its own right.  Sweet caramel malt flavors and dark fruits.  Medium bodied and a smooth drink, but that alcohol definitely gets you in the aftertaste and gives you a warm, flushed feeling.  Its a good beer, yes, but there are better ones of this style out there.
"
1," JAN 25, 2008 One of the first good Belgians I ever had, pretty much the standard in accessiblity and a well-rounded Belgian. Nice translucent appearance with a off-white head that releases fruity aromas. Flavors of smooth malts, yeast and dark fruits (some raisin, hint of banana and citrus) that finished quite well. Great beer, but there are lots of Belgians out there that perform much better. Il bet its really nice with 3+ years of age on it.
"
1," 330mL bottle from Regionals  from a Chimay glass of course. Pours a murky deep brown with a big fluffy off white head. Looking very sexy. 	The aroma is dominated by dark fruits, plum and raisin. Nice and spiced too, with a bit of yeast and brown sugar. Its a familiar Belgian aroma, but strong and in your face. Which I like.	The brown sugar sweetness dominates the first sip, a bit sweet. The next sip shows more malt, those raisins show up, some mild bitterness is there. It becomes much easier to drink with each successive sip. Spices come in stronger as it warms, becomes quite a nice beer. The 9% ABV is completely hidden. 	Nom.
"
1," The Chimay Ales always give you a nice amber body with a thick tan head.  And the smell is like honey-malt.  The taste is sweet, but not overly sweet.  A nice Strong Belgian ale that is still smooth and easy to get down.  You don't even notice the high alcohol content until you stand up.  Drank this while listening to new Radiohead CD (interesting combination)
"
1," At the brew pub.  Pours a clean dark black with a small brown head.  The aroma is of fairly strong coffee and roasted malt.  The flavors are a very nice strong coffee flavor with the distinct flavor of roasted coffee beans lingering and covering up any other expected stout flavors that might be presant.  Its a little thin but has a great dry coffee finish.
"
1," Aroma is flowery and of sweet malt.  Pours a dark-ruby brown color into the glass.  Flavor is of sweet caramel, fruit, and of alcohol.  Very tasty and enjoyable.		1 pt. 9.4 oz. bottle.
"
1," Hazy pale yellow coloured. Too much phenol, banana and yeast everywhere. A bad brew.
"
1," Smells great!  Belgin, dubbel-style aroma... a fruity (apple?)  malt smell.  Head is thick and creamy.  Color is brown and murky.  Smooth, cherry flavors with a dry, alcahol aftertaste.  Tingles the palate.  I like it... I dont think I can drink this every day, but it is definately good.
"
1," Vidunderlig god kloster l det er bestemt verdensklasse, den er lige som den skal vre, og det er samtidig problemet den stikker ikke ud.
"
1," 12oz bottle bought at a grocery store in Warsaw, IN. Weak aroma. Taste is nicely balanced mix of light caramel and floral hops. Moderate bitterness lingers. Very enjoyable, smooth IPA with plenty of hop flavor.
"
1," Bottle.  Pours a dark reddish-brown color.  It has a light aroma of light malts and fruits.  It has a slight aroma of hop bitternes.  The taste is mildly sweet, yeasty, malty, and lightly spiced.  This one is also not as good as it used to be.  If I had to compare Id say this one has suffered the least with the Bleu and Blanche really taking hits.
"
1," From the bottle at the De Heeren 20th Anniversary party during last weeks trip to Belgium. Reviewed from notes.		Served in an Orval mini chalice.		Poured a moderate plum-brown color with a thick and foamy off-white head and some pretty good lacing on the way down.		The nose first brought forward quite a bit of brown-sugar-like sweetness without enough yeast character. Its clear from the start that this needed better attenuation. Mild caramel and a faint bit of dark fruit.		Body was too sweet and the finish too full.		On a side note, we had this again later in the week at the abbey cafe. That sample was too dry rather than too sweet, so there may be some inconsistencies at this point. Given that Chimay is brewing it, I imagine it could be recipe changes rather than brewing errors.
"
1," Hints of flower perfume malty aroma. Pours a cloudy brown with a reddish tint. Nice beige head that soon fades to lace. Mild bubbly on the tongue turning into a mild tingle, but yet smooth. Carmel fruity taste. Finish is towards the dry side with a hint of chocolate. Dont be in a hurry to drink this. The flavor really comes alive near the bottom of the glass. This is a excellent beer. I highly recommend to all. I am for sure going to get more.

1," Cask gravity at Egham spring festival 2011.  Hazy gold thin lasting white head.  Looks in good nick.  Peach and tropical fruit aroma.  Touch of rubber on the aroma.  Lovely peach apricot flavour.  Really tasty.

1," Bottle 50 cl. Courtesy of fonefan. Pours a clear yellow with a lacing white head. Odd, unclean and somewhat tart nose. Thin body, sweet and mashy with a metallic edge and quite some yeast. Bad. 2711111
"
1," 750mL bottle.  Little head, but great carbonation.  Fruity and floral with a good carbonation bite.  Sweet, but clean and dry.  Good warming sensation at the end.
"
1," Draft at Rock Bottom Atlanta during the 4th of July Celebration with alexanderj and kleyland.  Light gold color.  Thin, white head.  Clean flavor with a nice hoppy profile.
"
1," 12oz bottle from Orland Park Binnys single rack. Pours hazy orange with soapy two finger off-white head. Aroma is grapefruit , pine, oranges, hops, and caramel malt. Flavor is bitter hops, caramel malts, grapefruit and a little pine. More malt forward than a hop bomb. Has a decent balance and some hop bitterness. Decent IPA.
"
1," 750ml.  Pours a deep brown with reddish hue with a medium size beige head.  Fruity aroma.  Taste is very well balanced with caramel and yeast and malts.  Very drinkable and pleasant.  Never dissapoints.
"
1," Tulip at BI - Strong aroma of dark chocolate, coffee, tobacco, brown sugar and charcoal.  Flavor has some molasses, burnt dark chocolate malt, dark roast coffee and a touch of bitter hops.  Alcohol is too strong in the flavor.  Palate is ashy and sticky.  Interesting and tasty.
"
1," Bottle 500ml.Clear light to medium yellow color with a small average, frothy, fair lacing, mostly diminishing, off-white to white head. Aroma is light light malty, toasted, moderate citrus - lemon, artificial citrus. Flavor is moderate sweet and light light citrus acidic with a average to long duration, light light citrus sweet. Body is medium, texture is watery to oily, carbonation is soft. [20100613]
"
1," JUL 29, 2009 Bottle. Pours a hazy golden color with a nice white head. Aroma has notes of spicy yeast and grassy/herbal/hay-like hops. Flavour is simililar to the smell, with a nice bitterness in the finish. Very spicy/wheat-like with a light hoppy twist. Medium bodied with high carbonation, which makes it a bit refreshing though the high ABV. A quite good triple.
"
1," One of my favorite all-time beers.  This introduced me to a whole new world outside of San Diego county.  Aroma is dried fruits and apples.  Flavor when properly handled is complex, floral, fruity, raisins, rum, candy, yeasty love.  One of my perennial favorites.
"
1," Dark amber with big head. Aroma yeast,  caramel, chocolate. Taste sweet,  yeast, dough, fruit. Body and texture medium, carb fizzy. Well hidden alcohol.

1," OCT 26, 2003 Nearly perfect in every way except for the price. I really did like it, what a great smokey yet slightly sweet flavor. Made by Monks so I can say that I pray I can find it cheeper. Terrific though a bit more bitter than my other faves.
"
1," JAN 29, 2008 Bottle. Very aromatic with longlasting thick head. The froth contained a vanilla-like taste-which remained constant in the beer until the end. A beer you know will always be great.
"
1,sniffer
1," Pours very dark brown / black with a dark brown head.  The aroma is all coffee that is dark roasted, no cream or sugar has been added.  Medium / light body with a light amount of carbonation.  Starts out with a lot of coffee and a light undercurrent of some citric spice.  This has far too much coffee for someone like me, but they set out what they wanted to do.
"
1," Not the kind of beer you expect to find in Nashville.  Great black color, nice flavor, but a soft mouthfeel.  This should be chewy.
"
1," 33cl bottle.	Vintage 2007 from my beer cellar.  Ages nicely.  Deep amber colour
"
1," Nice reddish brown color with a medium nicely laced white head.  The aroma is mostly fruity and malty. Nice fruity, malty and spicy flavors with a fruity/sweet finish. Light to medium body and an oily mouthfeel, lively carbonation. Although it is not up to its sisters quality, Chimay Bleu, it is a very good beer.
"
1," MAR 8, 2010 (bottle) pours a murky dark red-brown colour with a huge off-white head. aroma is sweet spices, notably cinnamon and cloves, raisin, light aromatic hops and alcohol. flavour has many roasted notes, yeast, wheat, chocolate, alcohol and the same subdued spiciness as in the aroma. medium alcoholic body with mild, lively carbonation and a gentle bitter aftertaste. a flavourful brew, but subtle and shy.

1," i disliked this one.  on tap.  o.k. looking-- amber in color with light head.  flavor didnt come through as much as it should
"
1," What a beer.  Expensive, but worht the price of admission.  Deep brown color with an even deeper aroma.  You can smell it long before you tase it.  Very strong maltiness with loads of carbonation.  Finish lasts long after you swallow.  Outstanding.
"
1," Cork popped off with a shot, and I almost lost it behind the television set.  Beautiful head that overflowed the bottle and filled the glass.  Then continued on for the enire pour.  Aromas were instantly spicy and fruity.  Flavors were much drier than I had expected with all the spice and and maltiness coming through.  Dry, bitter finish.  I thought I was going to like this better than the Blue since it was a Dubbel, but I will have to stick with the majority and put my order in at Blue, Red, then White.
"
1," SEP 14, 2008 Date"
1," Bottle.  Pours a hazy yellow gold with a very nice white head on top.  Nose is wheaty with light bananas and spice.  Flavor was delicious.  While I am reviewing, I am actually suprised to reminded that this was a wit.  I thought it was more of a hefe, but in any event it was very good.  Lovely, citrus/sour finish that finished the creamy mouthfeel.  Id have another if it were around as it was very much a thirst quenching brew. Thanks to lewis13 for the bottle.
"
1," Im sharing a bottle of this with my beer buddy Beerbaron617.  I have to say, its everything I expected. I do wish it had more of an aroma, I feel as if its sort of lacking there. A bit grainy mabye, but nothing remarkable.  Its got an awesome mouthfeel, light and with great carbonation. A beautiful color, opaque ruby red/ brown. Wonderful flavor. Its lightly fruity, dark fruits, mildly bready, and very well balanced.  Overall, very nice.
"
1," Bomber shared with friend Damian. Pours out a murky golden brown with a huge head but it quickly disappeared. Aromas of vine ripened plums berries and grapes. Belgium yeast add some spicy tones along with the roasted malts. Tastes follows nose with a slight sweetness due to the added dark candied sugar. Lively mouth feel. Finishes long with a pleasant lingering yeasty maltiness. Another winner from Chimay.
"
1," Sweet-malty, a bit papery nose with ""oaky"" hops in the background; moderate sweet-bitter flavour, light bodied and soft; mild, light bitter-sweet finish with traces of the typical ""Bohemian"" qualities. A pleasant and decent Pils.....
"
1," 12 oz bottle. Pours a deep dark brown nearing black with a thinning  off beige head.  Aroma is a bit spoiled funky brett- oaky, woody, medium bourbon and oak,grass, earth, light chocolate malt, some stale oxidation.  Flavor is more off brett, funk, stinky blue cheese, metallic, light burnt malts, toast, chocolate, nuts, and an earthy metallic- mineral and off astringent finish- some dms as well.  Meh.
"
1," APR 14, 2008 Second place finisher in my book! Belgium sure knows how to make good beers. And Chimay is easy to get in Chicago, dont know if it is as good here as it is in Belgium
"
1," Clear golden with a medium off white head. Sweet malty aroma with grain and breadish notes. Flavour likewise along with caramel and it finished mild bitter.
"
1,"  This one pours a very dark ruby color.  There was a small off white head that drops away quickly. Tt left a bit of lacing.  The aroma was a bit thin.  I got some hints of the black cherry and a touch of roastiness.  The taste is a bit on the light side also.  The black cherry is evident in the taste, but not overly done.  Some roastiness to the taste also.  A decent beer.
"
1," Not bad, but have to agree with the previous rater, a little too much of everything here.  Maybe this one is an acquired taste?
"
1," It is a very tasty Ale.  The Rochefort  Trappistes 10 is better IMHO but this is a very drinkable ale full of interesting tastes and smells.
"
1," Small bottle, 		the beer started to bubble up to the top of the bottle when the cap was popped, 	has a hazy/murky dark brown pour, the sediment in the bottle poured into the glass and left a lot of particles in the ale, I tried to avoid pouring the sediment, made a one finger high light tan colored head, head deflated to a ring and cover that had some open areas, there was a large effervescent hill in the center of the glass along with many small effervescent hills bubbling away, 		aromas of dark fruit aromas of raisin and prune, yeast, hint of chocolate, dark bread, brown sugar sweetness,		flavors of dark fruit, bread, bread and brown sugar sweetness, this beer has a little pepper, citrus and hop bite at the finish and the finish is dry, 		has a nice mouth feel with some creaminess on the palate, I felt a little alcohol warmth on the tongue when the ale was at room temperature, 		a nice Dark Strong Ale.
"
1," 750 ml dated 11/07, according to cork. Fruit aroma. Slightly hazy brown/amber. Head didnt last in goblet. Taste is initially fruity-- not dark fruits either-- but then becomes darker, with plums, brown sugar and maybe raisins. Big malt, little hops. Cannot taste the ABV. Effervescent carbonation to a fault.
"
1," I typically dont enjoy IPAs, however, this flavor was not a bitter as most IPAs. It smells and looks good. Not as strong as Id expect, but a good smell. The flavor was delicious, however, it clearly is not the flavor of an IPA. I really dont enjoy how it stays on my tounge, it feels coated with bitterness. I was impressed with this beer from the standpoint that it tastes, smells, and looks good. However, it is not quite correct for an IPA. Also, it doesnt sit on my palate well. Overall, a very good beginners IPA.
"
1," Pours a slightly hazy yellow color with a white head.  Aroma is wheaty, clove, and some banana.  Flavor is wheaty, lots of cloves, and some banana.

1," JAN 18, 2009 	Name"
1," Dark, ruby accented, amber liquid. One-finger head of foam that dissipates to a thin film, rather quickly. Decent lacing is present.		Deep, dark fruits dance on top of sweet roasted malts. Caramel and brown sugar play a sweet song, written by toffee. Swirling overripe bananas dance by, barely able to stand, but still present and making a good show of it. Yeast is trying to hold them up but has been drinking Port all night and is now chewing bubblegum, trying to hide it.		Dark fruits and tasty, sweet malts dominate. Caramel and molasses. Nice spicy bite at the end. Good yeasty notes.		Nice and creamy feeling, but abit lacking, overall, in the mouth. Would benefit greatly from abit more oomph. Great tasting, but just a tad too thin, for me.		Great drinking potential. Just watch out for the well-hidden 9% ABV.
"
1," JAN 28, 2011 0.33l bottle. Pours dark, unclear, thick brown with a small head. Looks like there is a lot of carbonation, but on second look I can see its lots of tiny sedments. Quite anonomys nose, but you can sense the yeast and perhaps a hint of pare. Tastes some what alcohol, but just enough to give you a warm feeling. Strong, almost chilli-like, and dry aftertaste. I quite like this beer.
"
1," Pour is a deep red brown color with a decent sized white head. Nose is of dark fruits and yeast. Taste is mostly of fruits, maybe with some earthy notes. Extremely light, and very well carbonated.
"
1," Dark red body with a thick foamy head thats last pretty long and shrinks to a thin layer of foam. Aroma is of plums and dried fruits, little yeasty and a strong sour smell. Flavor is of dried fruits and plums, was very sourish in the begingin but that disapeard when it warmed up. Palate is thin.
"
1," very nice dark belgian ale with hints of roasted malt,very tasty robust flavor.
"
1," 750ml bottle.  Pours a deep brown with a cream head.  Definitely dark fruit on the nose and the taste.  Great balance of sweet, tart, and bitter.  My first Belgian Strong so Il probably come back and re-rate this after some more experience.
"
1," Deep mahogany color with a huge frothy head and a fair amount of carbonation. Aroma is spicey with tones of fruit and maltieness. Begins lightly malty with tones of lightly sweet carmel, gives way to a citrusy fruit flavor with a fair amount of yeasty spice. Finishes dry and spicy with a lasting yeast presence.
"
1," Bottle, 4.9%. Citric farmhouse aroma, refreshing. Hazy dark copper colour. Stable, creamy tan head. The flavour is nicely sweet, turns a little bready with hayish hop notes. Low bittterness. Very pleasant. Mild carbonation.

1," what i am rating here is the 1987 vintage available at the kulminator (antwerp) which held up very well to time gone is almost all hop and malt charachter leaving behind more of a port like beer with very fine carbonation a good aroma somewhat of a diminishing head but leaving lace and a quite unique flavor seek this place out if you go

1," Reddish brown, good head. Light fruit aroma. Bubbly on the tongue, Evaporates quickly. Mild dark brown flavor that goes to the throat.
"
1," Dark amber with a tiny beige short lasting head. Aroma was sweet witt toasted malt, caramel, overripe fruits and chocolate notes.
"
1," 33cl bottle. BB 2015. Poured hazy darker brown color with a frothy, beige head, nice lasting lacing. Aroma is dark fruit and yeast, some alcohol also deteced. Flavor is raisin and plums, yeast and quite sweet with some spices in the finish. Also towards finish more alcohol warmth. Nice trappist, but not the greatest. The aroma wasnt really so inviting. Should probably age for some years.
"
1," on tap-pours an off white head and yellow color.  Aroma is sweet light malt, some diacytl, saaz hops.  Taste is spice (saaz) hops, sour/diacytl, secondary sweet light malt.
"
1," Out of the stubby little 33 cl. brown bottle, and into a tulip, the beer looked dark red, with a two inch thick foamy head fed by lively carbonation beneath. The fruity, spicy, chocolaty aroma accentuated the malty nature of the brew. The taste was warming and mellow with the very sweet fruity malt chasing the dusty yeast and powered cocoa into the background. It was not as complex as other Trappist ales, but was quite satisfying in its own way. Full bodied and sticky, with a lingering spicy dry aftertaste, and just a touch of grassy hops. Alcohol warmth is felt long after the glass is drained, making this a wonderful beer to cap one of those cold winter nights.
"
1," SEP 5, 2004 The main problem with this beer is its excessive sweetness. A bit too costly, and given the 4+ ratings on this site, a bit disappointing... one is much better off with the smaller Trappist breweries. Chimay is perhaps a victim of its success.
"
1," Bottled.	Clear golden coloured with a white head.	Aroma of malts, caramel and spices.	Flavour of malts and caramel with notes of spices.
"
1," Beer pours a hazy, dark plum-brown color with a large, off-white, frothy, quickly and mostly diminishing head. The aroma is malty with light notes of toasted grain and toasted bread; yeasty with trace notes of cellar; light note of spicy alcohol and yesa trace of rosewater and a trace note of something metallic. Pretty much an aromatic nap. The flavor is not a lot better. Its moderately sweet, lightly bitter with a long, lightly bitter, moderately warm finish with trace higher-alcohol retros. The body is medium, the texture is velvety and the carbonation is lively.
"
1," citric nose, malty - dark amber, little head - sweet malty, little hoppy aftertaste - rond - ok, and as boring as this rate zzzzz
"
1," Dark brown beer medium beige head. Malty aroma with toffe. Notes of chokolate in the flavor. Very light for a trappist.
"
1," Brown ale, off white lasting head. Malty aroma. Yeast. Some sourness. Schwarzbroot. Complex flavour with peaches. Sweet and roasted malts. Pepper. Notes of brown sugar. Yeast. A touch of hops in the finish. The complex aroma is very well balanced by a discrete underlying sourness (fruit). Hides the ABV very well. All time classic abbey ale

1, BA Porter	Date
1," JUN 16, 2005 hazy amber with floral and citrus scent.  Very nice palate and flavor.   Commercial description is pretty accurate.  Its really good,  perhaps a little too much carbonation for its type.  As good as it is, some places charge way too much for it.  Buyer beware.  Some places think they can charge anything for a chimay- which is because some idiots will pay anything for a reputable brew.  Ive seen the large 25.4 oz bottle sold for as little as USD 6.99 and as much as USD 14.99.  Dont be a fool!
"
1," bottle- reddish/brown. substantial white head, with good retention. carbonation was also substantial. flavor was that of some nuttyness, dark fruits, cherries, yeast, and alcohol. Was not blown away, but admittedly, this is not my favorite style.

1," 11.2 oz bottle. Pours hazy dark copper color with off white head. Aroma and taste of malt very lite beer with a slight bitter after taste.
"
1," awesome beer. Dark, rich roasted carmeley flavors, figs, raisins, dates, and bread come to the tongue.  Spicy, robust flavors dont overpower but saturate and then retreat from your tongue until the next drink, with a hint of spice leftover, just a great smell and taste all around. Love it. Im going to miss being able to buy it here overseas. Try it its lovely

1," Typical belgiun pour with a diminishing white head.  Aroma of yeast and spice.  Flavor mostly all yeast with some alcohol.  Il stick to the White version of Chimay.
"
1," Very dark in the coloring, like a barleywine, in the look and aroma.  Smells of fruit, raisins, bananas, pears and cloves.  Very complex and slightly acidic, bittersweet with a roasted nutty malty caramel like aftertaste.  Very full and satisfying.

1," Very good, but perhaps slightly over-rated in my opinion.

1," APR 27, 2006 Bottle sampled with Stegosaurus. Pours brown with an off-white head. Aroma of yeast, citrus, and hops. Flavor is alcohol, sweet and bitter.
"
1," Cloudy yellow appearance. Taste is bananas enough to satisfy any gorilla. Yeasty overtones. I'm not really into wheat beers but for the style this will suffice.
"
1," tap at brewery - Aroma is mild and bland.  Toffee, carmel, and a bit of nuttiness.  Pours dark brown with little head or lacing.  Flavor is thankfully stronger than aroma.  Carmel, toffee, hops, and toasted malts.  Palate is sticky and sweet.  More like an amber than a Scotch ale.  A little too mellow for my tastes, maybe they should call it 20 Shilling.

1,"  Bottled. 	Cloudy grey/yellow/brown. 	Smokey juniper up front, followed up by fruity esters. Smokey flavour from burnt wood. Finishes mild. Bloody interesting and nice!

"
1," Bottle (650ml) shared at Biegamans Summer Gathering -- my bottle courtesy of lewis13. Pours black with ruby hues and an average size somewhat-lasting light-brown head. Aroma of bourbon (but thankfully not too much) along with chocolate, some roastness, oats and oak. The bourbons even more subtle in the flavour which is nice (thats how it should be!) along with sweet malt, chocolate, oak, some hops and a mild bitter finish. Medium bodied. This is bourbon barrel-aged done right, its not overpowering. I really enjoyed it.

1," Subdued.  Dark brown in color.  Aroma is nutty, coffee, dark chocolate, hickory.  Taste is coffee and chocolate with some toffee thrown in on a good roasted malt.

1," Hazy brown beer with ferm beige  foam. Complex nose of caramel, chocolate, dark cakes and malts. Full taste with some sweetness and with a great bitter finish.
"
1," 33cl bottle- Copper coloured which was far too hazy and spoilt the appearance rating. Spices, fruit and raisins in the aroma with fruit, malt and mild spices also detected in the taste.
"
1," Dark brown in color with a very small head. Taste is alcohol, grapes, spices, and raisins. I really enjoyed this.
"
1," Small head of creamy grey colour. Aroma with notes of coffee and caramel, a bit roasted, sweet, a bit of cassis in it.Soft in mouth, in balance.Slightly a finish, though.
"
1," 22oz bottles acquired in trades with atpayne & Sephiroth (thanks!). Poured a dark black color with brown edges and a larger sized tan head. Aromas of wood, vanilla, bourbon, roast, oak, light coffee, and chocolate. Tastes of vanilla, lighter wood, oats, bourbon, roast, and light coffee. Soft and creamy body. Il go against the grain on this one as I really enjoyed it.
"
1," I not one for really fruity beers, but this one blends the abundance of fruit witha  good alcohol content.  Great aroma and taste.  Goes down smooth with some welcome aftertaste
"
1," DEC 23, 2007 Wow I like this one alot. Smells of fruit and caramel and pours a cloudy rouge color. Small pillowy head that last throughout. Tastes of caramel and yeast and wood? Awesome beer but the bread and metallic tastes retract somewhat. I wish the flavors were more concentrated.
"
1," 750 ml... Cloudy dark copper poor with a small beige head.  Aromas of blackberries, raspberries, peaches, apricot, caramelised malts... very fruity floral aromas. Nothing spectacular to the palate, little bitterness, mildly sweet, lively carbonation and medium bodied.  Flavors of caramel, black cherries, plums ... not spectacular but preaty good....
"
1,"	A balance of cushiony pils malts and spicy Saaz inhabits this classic Czech Pilsener, ending in a clean and well calculated herbal bitterness.		Further Personal Perceptions"
1," Tan coloured beer with little head.  Aroma is slightly honey with a little sweet malts.  Flavour is honey and quite sweet.  Finish is still quite sweet and malty as opposed to bitter.  An alright beer.
"
1," Bottled. Yellowish golden colour with a small white head. Aroma is grass, some hay, mild breadyness as well as some slight herbal and salty notes. Flavour is bready malts along with some slight sweetness, some herbs as well as quite grassy and hayish in the finish. Rather biting carbonation.
"
1," Oh so scared of opening my three year olds, I opted for a young batch of this instead (LAm-434). Poured into its own tulip glass, a two inch off-white head formed atop an auburn copper body, with very fine carbonation agitating the bread crumb yeast floating about. Low Cabernet red grape and general vinous aromas, yeasty and earthy. A little toffee for sweetness, but more malty and peaty. Aroma follows through into the mouth, well rounded flavours, light, very fine carbonation, medium bodied, and quite fairy floss sweet throughout, with earthy undertones, leafy hops, gritty malt and a generous dark fruit, almost blackcurrant, zest, that adds a needed balance. Quite Scotch ale peaty, good length in the bitter and lowly sweet swallow, but, like a good red wine, I could tell it was young. I need to open one of the three year olds and see how much theyve matured. A complex and lovely brew.
"
1," Bottle. Pours a cloudy golden color with a bright white head. Aroma is packed with earthy hops. Flavor is dominated by the earthy and dirty hops. Crisp finish with some lasting sweetness.
"
1," 500 ml bottle in Germany. Clear hoppy aroma. Hoppy non bitter notes, light, a bit watery taste however a nicley done unfiltered beer.
"
1," Colour is dark mahogony with a thick, beige head. Roasty vanilla aroma, with some wood and whiskey. Quite bubbly and malty at the front and fairly smooth as the beer settled.  Toasty flavours with some whiskey and caramel. A little acidic at the end but overall pretty good.
"
1," Bouteille 33 cl du Centre de lle  Boudry.	Nectar brun acajou, mousse crme et crmeuse, ptillement abondant. Nez fruit de levure et de chocolat, touches dalcool. Saveurs douces et vives, sans tre trop sucres, notes de poivre, herbes, banane et pices. Got un peu piquant, longue amertume en finale avec vanille et torrfaction.
"
1," Incredible colour.  Incredible head.  Creamy.  Very fruity Abbey.  Perhaps slightly too bitter for me for this type of beer, but good.  Not my favorite from Chimay.
"
1," Creamy light brown head that suits the dark almost black color that when held up to the light almost blocks out even direct light. I think with this beer I seemed to understand for the first time the roasted flavor that people talk about. This beer is an easy smooth drink without the big dog bite that my server and what i had heard built it up to be. The next time I go I will try it first and may end up re-rating it then.

"
1," Cask - The Cherry Tree, Canterbury. Small & lasting white to off-white head, some soapy lace atop a clear, dark yellow body. Grassy, pine & orange hop aromas. Juicy & lemony on the tongue. Light to medium, soft body with a lingering finish. Slightly dry, fresh & fruity finish with good length.
"
1," Let this one warm quite a bit. Would like just a little more sweetness - it actually seems a bit peppery...but its still quite good. Yeast electricity still shines.		This one plays lighter than expected - we have the carbonation to thank for that. Deep dark stewiness is countered by spritely carbonation and pepperiness and other spice along with yeast electricity to dance on the palate and enjoy the ride down. Finish is clean for a normally hefty style.		I have been meaning to review this for a few days but have had to go back to get more at the store. Yknow why? Cause I enjoy drinking it immensely and writing about it gets in the way of its enjoyment. Whaddya think about that? Its damn good.

1," APR 11, 2004 You almost can't call this beer"
1," almost clear, deep amber coloured, rather quickly diminishing, but then stable off-white head; sourish-wheaty and dark-malty, a bit chocolatey nose; moderate sourish-sweet flavour, light bodied, but a bit sticky; cacao-powder and sourish wheat in the finish. The cacao doesnt harmonize well with the wheat........
"
1," On tap at the brewery.  Pours a hazy orange with fluffy tan head.  Huge banana/clove nose with something really sweet, like Equal.  Flavor is crisp, light wheat.  Nice drinker.
"
1," Draft... Disney Boardwalk location...  Clear, deep amber lager with a small, fizzy, white head. Caramel aroma with earthy and spicy notes. Malty flavor, but well-balanced with good bitterness. Medium-bodied and creamy with lively carbonation. Coarse, lightly bitter finish.
"
1," Botella comprada en supermercado. Color marron oscuro, espuma color crema. Aroma excelente. En boca se siente el alcohol, notas de frutas secas, amarga, todo junto. Muy buena.
"
1," Pours a golden yellow with a white head.  Lots of carbonation.  Aroma is of honeysuckle.  Taste is very sweet and flowery.  Not a bad beer.
"
1," A step below the grande reserve but only barely. Sampled with some belgian dark chocolate. Such a nice combo. Aroma is sweet with rich malts. Appearance is very brune. Mouthfeel is tremendous and pure. Flavor is so malty and good. Another great chimay. Really hard to beat.
"
1," Nashville.  Pretty!  Smells good!  Fairly hoppy, but not as metallic as the rest of their beers (but still kinda).
"
1," Aroma is delicate, slight plum and cherry notes.  Hazy dark amber, head thins out to a white line, no biscuit.  Smooth malty, med-high sweetness, low bitterness with no alcohol.  High carb, but smooth with a touch of warming.  Damn good beer.
"
1," Pours red-brown, slight haze. Thin head, persisting. Nose of caramel and orange peel, yeast. Very creamy in the mouth, caramel is coming back slightly. Very long aftertaste sugar bread (?).
"
1," JAN 20, 2006 Bottle2005 @ Blues Bar, Globen, StockholmSomewhat hard to comment on this, as it has been down my throat so many time over the years. Must be close to 20 years since I had my first one. Its a great beer, no doubt, but to me it taste just... Chimay Blue... Well, I give it a try. Slightly sweet and cheesy aroma with some sourness thrown in together with a dash of malt and the ever present yeast. All this is reflected in taste as well, with a small addition of bitterness at the very end.Earlier Rating"
1," A cloudy brown, large foamy decaying head, not much lacing.  Alcohol not so well hidden.  Excellent malt balance and no Unibroue aftertaste.  Fine palate; hints of spice, finish of orange and black liquorice.
"
1," Dark amber beer with a nice thick head. Yeasty and fruity aroma and taste of yeast, malt and alcohol. Very complex and interesting beer.
"
1," 2009 Bottle - All my belgian strongs seem to be gushers right now...pours (on its own) a thick, dark copper with a medium off white head...aroma is sticky apple, plum, brown sugar and cinnamon...flavour is similar, nicely effervescent, with a fruit forward palate that gives way to dk rich molassas malt, roast and a bit of dirt...nicely warming...cant believe I hadnt rated this yet...
"
1," Poured dark brown with a two finger tan head that disipated quickly, but had good lacing.  There was a sustained complex taste to this beer with the taste of fruit present.  The alcohol content is well masked.
"
1," 330mL bottle from an in person trade. Pours a dark, murky brown, slight orange tinge to it making it appear copper toned when held to the light, with a smaller than expected white head. Aroma right away is what you would come to expect, yeasty wheaty maltyness, with the obligatory dark fruity aspects. Flowery and perfume-like, which is quite elegant and pleasant as it warms. Flavour is more of the same, with a decent thick feel to the body of this brew. Herbal-like hopping is present as well. Good sweet malts in the aftertaste. My only big problem with this is what I have with a lot of beers like it, in that I just dont really get much complexity from it. Its probably a pretty fresh bottle, and with plenty of age Im sure it could be something great. I just dont have the patience for such things. All in all a good one though. I meant to give it a higher rating but the numbers just dont seem to add up the way Id like them to. It does of course get much better as it warms.
"
1," On tap. Poured a reddish brown color. Fruity flower tastes and smells with berry hints (was that raspberries I smell). Very smooth to drink with a dry finish. Very easy and enjoayable to drink.
"
1," Strong yeast in the aroma, otherwise a malty, chocolate nose. Sweetness of golden syrup and some fruitiness like peach. 	Spicy flavours, peppery at first but turns slightly toward aniseed and allspice. Some yeast in the flavours.	The alcohol is obvious, but along with the spice it adds warmth (not like I need this right now, seeing as its 30 degrees C outside...).	Some fruit in there like red grapes and dark plum, as well as hints of raisin and caramel. 	A hoppy bitterness in the aftertaste which is nice. Great ale.
"
1," drank at home in a chimay glass. dark cloudy brown, head does not last. slightly sweet. Its worth drinking.
"
1," Draft sampler at Barley Island. Poured a black color with an average creamy off-white head that lasted and had good lacing. Light sweet roasted malt aroma. Medium to full body with a smooth texture. Moderate toasted chocolate malt flavor with an average smooth finish. Solid drinkable porter.
"
1," Sweet caramel and butterscotch aroma with a nice flavour to match.
"
1," It had a cloudy yellow body, slighty fruity, and slightly hoppy.  Needless to say, it was very well balanced.
"
1," the 75 cl bottle is well balanced.  The flavor is not as complex as other Belgain strong beers.  It has a nice aroma of rosted malts and spices.  The finish is a bit mild compared Gulden Draak or Guden Carolus Cuvee Van De Keizer Blauw/Blue.  Chimay Blue is a good warm up to calibrate the senses to fully appreciate world of Belgium Strong Ales.
"
1," bottle - Pours very dark brown with a tan head.  The aroma is heavy on the bourbon with some roast malt underlying it.  The flavor is also heavy on the bourbon.  Theres roast malt and some chocolate notes under there too, but I thought the body was too light for all that bourbon.  In that sense it has the same flaw as the beastie barrel stout.  Its alright but could be better.
"
1," cloudy appearance typical of many wheat beers.  has a nice full head, with a typical wit beer taste.  eh.
"
1," Good spiced flavor the 9% really hits the palate. A caramel, spiced beer. More bitter than Rochefort. My second favorite beer. If you like Chimay and you like Belgian Trappist ales you should try Trappistes Rochefort 10.
"
1," Clear red-brown with a thin off white head.  Aroma is nutty, sweet malts.  Taste is very sweet, malty, nutty, some cocoa.  Good but really sweet.
"
1," From growler, courtesy of Immy.  Poured a very deep brown with hints of red.  Foamy tan head.  Nose has a mild nuttiness to it.  Flavor is sweet malts with a touch of sour.  Bitter baking chocolate in the aftertaste.  Palate is creamy.  Alcohol is nowhere to be seen, until youre done that is, which doesnt take long due to the immense drinkability of this one.
"
1," its not often you taste an IPA that has very little hop flavor, but this one was it. I was disappointed.
"
1," Delightful color and aroma, easy to drink, its a very nice brew, thought I like the grand reserve a little better

1," Roasty character without the bitterness of other black malts. Well balanced, delicious stout.

"
1," nose is a little black licorice, slightly bitter. pours black with very mild tan head.  palate is silky, like mosts oatmeal stouts.  taste is smokey and sweet, with mild bitterness.  i can definately taste the makings of my one of my favs, Black Majic.  A hint of alcohol fools you into believing this is high than it really is.  A pretty good oatmeal stout, but there certainly are better.

1," Cask Stillage from the Jug at the GABF, Colorado Convention Center 24/09/2009	Hoppy and slightly spicy fruit aroma. Golden coloured smooth on the palate and strong in alcohol with a crisp and bitter lasting malt finish.
"
1," Thanks to blutt59 for sharing this bottle.		The beer pours a yellow color with a huge white head. The aroma is citrus and bready malt. The flavor is bread, citrus, oranges, Belgian yeast and some alcohol. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. 		There is nothing off-putting in the flavor or aroma, but there is not too much exciting going on either.

Its light with a well balanced combination of grain, hay, funk, and roasted grain.  Carbonated to the point that it exaggerates its refreshing properties.  Light-medium body.  This is an easy drinker.

1," Deep golden to orangey coloured, cloudy , floaties visible, smaller foamy layer; solid sweet almondy nose, covering grainy, fruity and yeasty aromas; solid sweet flavour, full bodied; well hidden alcohol in the sweet almondy finish, some lonely hops and some forgotten fruits in the aftertaste. An almost perfect copy of a Belgian Triple, not avoiding the inevitable sweetness.......
"
1," Moderate malty and heavy yeastly aroma leaves no doubt of the belgian abbey product.Very nice creamy, light brown head. Cloudy look with some large particles. Maybe it should be tapped mor slowly? Brown colour.		Moderate sweet lasting taste. Yeast is very present, so if you dont like that - live Chimay for the rest us ;-)

1," 12oz bottle 4/16/10 (Binnys Naperville)-46 in English Pint-Pours dark brown almost black with some ruby tints and has ahuge tan head. Aroma of bourbon, roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, and caramel. Taste of  bourbon, coffee, chocolate, and roasted malt.

1," Pitch black body with a chocolate coloured head. Strongly alcoholic aroma  with notes of sweet dark fruit and bourbon. Flavour is highly alcoholic covering up the vauge notes of malt and chocolate underneath. Rough, and fairly thin bodied. Disappointing for my first barrel aged beer but am very glad I got to try it. Many thanks to Wohlfs and Qdog for bringing this to the Toronto Christmas Party 2004.

1," It would take me a bit to go back and see who sent me this in a trade.  Im genuinely grateful, I just dont want to take the time at this moment to go back and find out.  Im a bit buzzed and the weather is beautiful.  Pour is nice and black with tan accents.  Nose is sweet and malt and oats.  Taste is coffee and molasses, but lightly so.  Doesnt over coat or over power.  Rather light.

"
1," <P>The beer pours with a lazy, quick disipating head, which is surprising. Im used to having almost as much head as beer with belgian strongs. What head did form is a pale tan  with gray notes.  		<P>Theres a strong yeastiness to the aroma, almost like bread dough just as it starts to bake. The aroma is also very grapey/winey. It reminds me immediately of the wine the church I went to as a child uses for Communion. Below the yeast and wine I noticed a smell making me think of Rollos and Caramel Twix with light chocolate and caramel malt aromas.		<P>The flavor is an exercise in the melding of light and darkness. The bright flavors of bubblegum esters, yeastiness, the very faint sourness common to the style, chalk and the alcohol (very faint and only at the end) made for a very bright character that both contrasted and complimented the dark tones of the chocolate and caramel, a slight burnt bitterness and an even fainter smokiness. I was especially surprised to pick up on the burnt and smoke flavors, two flavors Ive never noticed in any of the Belgian strong dark ales.		<P>The palate is surprisingly carbonated considering the wimpy head but lacks the cottony carbonation that many of the lighter strongs (including Chimay Red) have that turns me off. The carbonation here balance the slightly creamy mouthfeel nicely.		<P>I was really surprised by this beer. Its probably one of very few of the style that Id actually buy on a regular basis.
"
1," (11.2 oz bottle).  Pours red-copper color with off-white head and yeast floaties (didnt pour the traditional way-just poured the entire bottle).  Wonderful aroma of dried cherries, banana, and some alcohol.  Taste is mildly sweet with a hint of sourness.  Unlike the white cap, the hops are less noticeable.  Medium bodied and somewhat thin and oily.  carbonation is flat and finish is quite smooth.  This is my least favorite Chimay and dubbels in general are not my favorite, but I did enjoy this beer.  Its not the best Trappist beer or dubbel around, but its a good beer nevertheless.
"
1," JAN 16, 2007 Had on tap at the brewpub in Jacksonville. Best of the sampler that I had - very solid brewpub stout. Good lacing with a mocha-colored head on top of a charcoal black pour. Sweet chocolatey aroma. Solid coffee stout flavor without the chalkiness and a bit of chocolate undertones to round it off. Perfect level of acidity - melts in your mouth. Earlier Rating"
1," deep red with the lacey white head.  There is a light touch of bitterness in the taste, but it does pour down smooth.  The only real drawback is that the flavor is a little thin.  After the blue, this is the second best Chimay beer.  Fantastic.  Cheers.
"
1," Bottle. Dark brown, with a slightly reddish hue that sports a big beige head. The aroma is of raisins, toasted malts, caramel, with a bit of plum. Bubbly, complex flavors that give that nice Belgian tang - caramel flavors mixed with fruit, roasted malts, and a slight banana. This is a very good beer - delicious.
"
1," APR 3, 2007 0.33L bottle in pint glass. Billowing tower of soft foam settles slowly on a heavily steeped copper-tea, and leaves a nice tatting all round. Yeast sediment riding atop the creamy cap gives the appearance of cinnamon-sprinkled cappucino, and the quarter-inch of cream lasts all the way down. Nose is bitter yeast/nut/corn/hop/skunk. Extremely well-blended and difficult to isolate any dominant taste. Creamy palate is the best I have sampled, almost like a cask nitro. Definitely on the dry side, and hoppier than other Belgians I have sampled. Alcohol not evident at all. This is a good  beer, but the yeast/hop combination has a taste twang that is slightly unpleasant to me.
"
1," Pours a crystal clear color with light legs but a shimmering character. The nose is bright and fruity, lots of pear and anise, some alcohol and light coconut. The flavor is sweet and full bodied, nice bouquet, perfectly balanced, buttery and full. The quintessential sake by my litmus test. Quite! +2? Ok.
"
1," A nice burgundy amber color interspersed with floating yeast. Effervescent khaki head. Rosy and smoky at the same time. Buttery, fruity, and malty. Caramel and cherry flavors blend effortlessly. Bought cold at the liquor store; this only gets better as it warms. The tangy carbonation spreads the smooth flavors across your tongue. There is certainly a lot going on here; Il be sure to try this again when I can afford it. Where do I apply to be a monk?
"
1," The aroma is very much what I like in a stout. Its got chocolate, toasted malt, coffee, and just the right amount of sweetness. The appearance is dark brown with a nice tan head. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is smooth but not as thick as I would like. The beer is overall very good.
"
1," Copper orange color.  Nice white head but doesnt last very long.  Nose of bananas, cherries.  Dry and a little spicy with a good amount of malt.  Clean and smooth.  A very good beer all around.

1," One of those beers you have drank often and forgot to rate.  Its a beautiful beer, fiery copper in color, suttle fruitiness to the nose.  I bring it and the blue to dinner parties often.  It is crips and refreshing with hints of honey and necture, a drink of the Gods.  It is served in country clubs across this nation.  Its a good starter chick beer if your girl gives you a hard time about rating.

1," bottle-thanks to vyvvy-pours mostly black with a foamy brown/beige head.  nose is all java-total coffee bliss for those that love a nice cup.  some light chocolate undertones is all i get with the java.  lots of bitter java on this one.  really tastes like a fresh cup of coffee.  somewhat metallic on the finish, but that wasnt that bad compared to the oatmeal stout from this brewery.  body again is somewhat thin.  really a fine stout here that would be great to try on tap when fresh.
"
1," On tap at the Seven Bridges brewpub.  Reddish brown with a tan head. Toasty malt nose, a bit of bread, with a nutty bitter tinge. Roasty-toasty flavors, nuts and bread. Solid, if unspectacular.

"
1," bottle poured into a chimay trappist glass has a thick copper amber color with lots of floating sediment and active carbonation. when held to the light the sediment is brought up with the carbonation and falls back down the sides of the glass, very pretty. aroma has sweet fruit, yeast, caramel, and flower pollen. flavor is well balanced, apricot coming through, light malted bitterness, flowery pollen, and some alcohol. mouth feel is medium with plenty of carbonation and a complementing texture. the yeast is what really stands out and makes this beer.
"
1," 330ml bottle from 2002. Pours a deep mahogany colour with a thick tan head. Aromas of raisins, chocolate, malts, belgian yeast. The flavour is just awesome dark fruits ie; rasins, prunes, big maltiness, breadlike yeastiness nice finish. Ive had this beer fresh before ( within 6 months anyway) and the 2yrs of ageing have definatly helped. Definately a classic once aged properly.
"
1,"	Deep, rich red hue with a fine, creame colored head.  Malt forward with aromas of bread, banana, cream soda, subtle hop character.	Tastes of maltiness with sweet foral esters, mild hop balance.  Like a loaf of bread fresh from the oven.	Dry finsh with good, thick mouthfeel.		Nice.
"
1," This beer pours a dark golden-brown, with an absolutely huge light brown head.  I smell mostly malt, with some hops - some earthy aromas, and a touch of toastiness.  Palate is tickled by the abundant carbonation.  Taste is a little sweet, a little toasty, and quite malty.  I quite enjoyed it.
"
1," Bottle As yellow as a pils can get but no head. Almost no nose, some malts. Flavour is very crisp, malty and weak hops. Nice soft long-lasting bitterness. Quality pils so to say.

1," Drinking this one to celebrate my second half marathon!  It was pretty rough but hoping this beer makes it all better.  Brown chestnut like color with a large foamy brown head.  Smells a bit of dates, brown sugar and yeast.  Taste is pretty yeasty.  Alcohol is pretty well hidden.  Has some of that brown sugar and a little roastyness.
"
1," very good beer, drinks smooth and full -- a very nice mellow abbey beer.  Bot as good as other chimay offerings but good.  I drinking this as I log in my Brewtopia tastes!  Life is good
"
1," Bottle. Dark golden with minimal head. Lightly fruity (apples), weak notes of whisky and something sour. Flat and boring. Has incredibly little to offer considering abv.
"
1," Draught, Seven BridgesDull light brown.  Hints of caramel.  A sweet, simplistic example.  Didnt give it much thought.
"
1," 33 cl bottle from Systembolaget.	Pours hazy and dark brown orange with a small light tan head.	Spicy and yeasty aroma. 	Sweet, malty and fruity taste.		I have realy loved vintage bottles of this beer.
"
1," A very good Belgian ale. Complex, the yeast is more floral than ester. Very pretty to pour.
"
1," Awesome towering tan head and opaque black body with a thic chocolatey aroma. Chewy and oily on the tongue with a coating chocolate sweetness throughtout, mitigated by a late bitter coffee finish. Nice roastiness settles on the tongue for a long drawn out finish.
"
1," ""A nice strong Belgian Ale to help along a cold winter evening. Pours a dark amber-brown and produces a bubbly, khaki colored head with small, long lacing and tight carbonation. Filling and highly carbonated, its smooth with a sweet yeasty kick. Flavor is dominated by musty fruits and rich yeast. It has a good spiciness and also touches on notes of licorice, fruit cake, muffins, wood and vanilla. This is a rather nice one, but I was expecting just a touch more complexity.""
"
1," Port, malt, bread, dark fruits...fruits galore. Huge yeasty perfume. Ap"
1,"//www.ratebeer.com/ShowBeer.asp?BeerID= are my favorite Belgian ales to date. Chimay is a bit smoother, but Orvals head and aroma are unbeatable.
"
1," A Sim rate. Cask at GBBF.Very pale watery appearance. So so fresh sweet pear. Some appley flavours too. Spicy sweet, but with a nice bitterness.
"
1," 12 oz. Clear copper with a lasting half-inch of creamy meringue above. Aroma of corn, dark toasted nut, and earthy root vegetables. Flavor is deep roasted walnut, toffee, lightly sour citrus and earthy roasted root vegetable. Medium body has average carbonation and is dry with roast and hops.
"
1," Sampler at the Nashville location - Poured a reddish brown in color with a very small tannish head that quickly disappeared.  Very little carbonation.  Aroma and flavor were both strong of roasty malts and very little hops.  Not a bad brown, but a little watery and needs better carbonation/head.
"
1," DEC 20, 2011 pours dark moody chocolate with a large frothy tan head. fruity sweet aroma, with caramel and brown sugar. this a strong, nicely balanced drink, plenty of heat from the 9% alcohol. roasted malt flavour, strong bitterness, caramel, liquorice, not massively complex, but its nice.
"
1," 750 ml bottle.  Pours dark brown with a lot of creamy, bubbly head.  Aroma is light, consisting of some raisin and molasses notes.  Flavor is pretty complex.  A lot going on.  Brown sugar, plum, raisin, burnt caramel, molasses, some spice.  There is a nice sweetness to this beer that is not necessarily sugary.  This beer is not quite as good or as complex as the Rochefort Trappist 10, but a solid beer that reinforces the fact that Belgian beer can be some of the best in the world.
"
1," Poured a clear golden color with light legs left on the glass.  Aroma of green apple, with a bit of sweet caramel / molasses.  Taste of tart green apple, with faint, honey, and alcohol taking a back seat.  The sweetness wasnt enough to balance out the massive tartness of this cider.  Thanks to Paul for sharing this!
"
1," on tap at brewpub. pale golden, slight haze, some retention and lacing. malt-lacking, big floral-piney cascadian nose. grapefruity small finish. soft to average carbonation, light body.
"
1," Not coming up with anything outstanding here.  To me, this is just another run-of-the-mill Belgian.  Pours dark red-brown, with overflowing carbonation (at first) that luckily subsided in short time to a slight tan head.  Vinous notes on the aroma, as well as apple cider.  Flavor was very similar, with yeast esters evident in the delicate banana flavors, which were complimented by strong vinous flavors and apple cider.  Some dark fruit in the mix as well.  Mouthfeel is too highly carbonated.  I'm not especially fond of this beer.
"
1," Bottled.  Hazy bronze colour, rich firm head. Grassy, buttery nose. Sweet and bready with fairly soft mouthfeel. Salty, grassy hops builds a bitter finish. An unfortunate note of vegetables sway over it all, making it much less attractive.
"
1," APR 12, 2005 Aroma of freshly baked cinnamon raisin bread.  Bronze color when held up to light, with a frothy beige head. Exceptional mouthfeel, coating the palate with a taste of the raisin bread. Alcohol is hidden perfectly. Finishes with a clean aftertaste, leaving the drinker wanting another chalice.
"
1," lime slices, butter cream, tobasco and tequila. An interesting melting pot although not balanced. Taste"
1," Pours mahogany with a quickly dissapating head and little lacing (for that it loses a point for appearance). Aroma is pleasing with honey, gingerbread, and ginger candy notes. Flavor is dominated by malts, with some raisin elements and ice tea highlights, no off flavors and an INCREDIBLY smooth finish. I guess that the leadup to this beer left me wanting a bit more...is that fair? Certainly a very nice beer, but Ill try other Belgain offerings before I return to this. 5.50 USD at the bottle shop in Anchorage....in Panama the beer sucks but its cheap, I guess the opposite is going to be true for this trip to Alaska.		Re-rate on the finish of the bottle. Definately grew on me....the flavor stayed with the beer through the warming, with more floral and ice tea notes. Quite, quite nice. Love Belgian beer...
"
1," I like this beer very much, a little bit more fruit than the blue. Great body and a very nice head and colour.	Very harmoniously in sweet- and bitterness.
"
1," Served from a 12 oz bottle picked up at Crown Liquors in Indy. Pours a deep red brown with almost no head. Aromas and flavors of barrel-ness, caramel, molasses, candy sugar.
"
1," Nice mahagony brown body is topped by a nice, reserved head. The aroma is slightly vinuous with an interesting smokiness that I wasn't expecting. The hopping is very reserved, but still manages to be a surprisingly complex brown.
"
1," Bottle from Corral Liquors in Granite City, IL. Pours black with a rocky, diminishing, mocha head. The nose is of coffee and cream, chocolate, and burnt/roasted malt. Medium-bodied, oily, and effervescent it concludes with a light bitter roasted finish. The flavor is dark roasted malts and bold coffee with a tight roasted coffee finish. A lingering coffee aftertaste follows with a faint metallic note in the background. The coffee flavor in this beer seems just a little ""off"" while on the tongue but is dead on in the aftertaste. My wife even mentioned that it smelled like I was drinking coffee as I finished off the glass sitting next to her. One of the better coffee stouts that Ive sampled, but this isnt my favorite style.
"
1," NOV 28, 2006 On of the great Trappist beer of the world. Full bodied, some burned caramel. Dark strong and wounderful beer.
"
1," Thanks to ilovedarkbeer for this nice one. Clear body with strong legs left on the glass. Aroma of rice and wrotten pineapple. Tastee is sweet, but a bit watery at 14.5% and a little watery. Kind of a buttery mouthfeel. Very smooth drinking.
"
1," JUL 15, 2009 (7/15/09, 12oz bottle, thanks BBB63) Brown-black body topped by small brown head.  Aroma is moderately sweet, vanilla/Bourbon, some chocolate.  Taste is medium sweet, Bourbon/vanilla, cocoa, some roast.  Light-medium body.  (6/3/6/3/12)		(12/19/05 22oz bottle, thanks BBB63) Enormous brown head atop a black body.  Aroma is moderately sweet, vanilla/bourbon, light wood.  Taste is moderately sweet, vanilla/bourbon, beneath which is buried light milk chocolate.  Over-carbonated light-medium body.  The beer is not strong enough to stand up to the bourbon barrel.  (6/3/5/2/10)

1," Jauhne mais pas brumeuse comme une witbier.  Beau col.  Odeur un peu citronn, mias pas autant quune hoegaarden par exemple.  Frais, un peu acide.  Une pointe de pomme verte.  Un peu damertume  la fin.  Un peu ptillante sur la langue.   Assez bon.

1," MAY 2, 2005 Creamy head and dark brownish red color.  Pleasant, fruity aroma, specifically banana.  Medium-full bodied beer although a little boring.  Still always a very good choice.
"
1," SEP 26, 2004 Pours a deep reddish brown with a moderate head that leaves a great lacing.  The initial aroma is malty and yeasty, but as it warms, the aroma gains a spice.  Very smooth and silky.  The taste is malty and fruity, and it too gains a spice as it warms.  The alcohol is well hidden which leads to a very smooth finish.
"
1," Bottle shared by JCB.  Hazy note on this one.  Sweet and malty with some dark fruits and must.  Pretty decent.
"
1," Pours ruby-red to brown with a thick beige head.  Yeasty, citrusy, spicy aroma.  Lots of malt in the flavor with less fruit than other Belgians.  Maybe some licorice.  Highly carbonated.  Pretty hoppy for the style, but I like it.  Fair amount of alcohol warmth.  Malt in the beginning finishes dry with the high level of alcohol and carbonation.  Decent brew.
"
1," OCT 7, 2003 More pronounced flavours than the Bleu. Cinnamon and toffee come across on the tongue and the nose, slight vinous notes, excellent balance of sweetness. My fave of the Chimays.
"
1," JAN 30, 2009 Bottle. Pours a dark brown with dark tan head. Aroma of yeast, alcohol, spice and malts. Light and fizzy on the palate with a heavy malt taste with a nice bite. I have to agree with others who are reminded of barley wine, although its not quite as heavy. A good brew none the less.
"
1," Since I dont like to use flowery terms in describing beer Ill just say that after living in both the Netherlands and Belgium this is one of the best beers Ive ever had.  Ive been drinking this for years and other than Rochefort 10, Westy 12 and the St Bernardus Apt 12 this is about as easy to drink and tasty beer you can find.
"
1," Gravicask at Manc Winter Fest.Dirty golden brown coloured. Sorry for this but it smells like someone pooed their pants then sat on it for a few hours. Flavour is not quite so offensive but far from great. Hay, manure, lots of sweet malt and raw alcohol. Tases like it is some way from being ready and as a result, not great at all.
"
1," One inch, off white head. Dark copper in appearance. Unique aroma of flowery spice. Smooth, with a slight hoppy aftertaste. Moderate amount of carbonation. Overall, a very unique beer.
"
1," Finally number 100 and it was nothing short of wonderful. Of corse that is expected of chimay having already had the blue and tan I knew this on would have to be great. It wasnt quite asa good as the blue but none the less great in itself. Deep reddish color with a big head. Aroma of exotic fruit and spice is almost intoxicating by itself. The first taste sets your tastebuds dancing in your mouth with malt and hop mixed giving a fruity earthy sensation that iss simply amazing. If you havent tried this or any of the Chimay line I highly recommnd and insist you try them.
"
1," aroma of fruit and yeast, hazy dark brown pour with lasting cream head, malty flavor with light sweetness and some late bitterness. full body. Alcohol becomes more present in finish.
"
1," Appears a murky brown with a small, 1 finger off-white head that stays around forever. Scattered lacing is left around the glass.	Smell is of mild cocoa, candy sugar, gentle caramel, vanilla, along with yeasty dough.	Taste is of the same aromas in the classic Chimay style.	Mouthfeel is smooth, caramely, sugary, with creamy vanilla sliding along the tongue. Very clean with sugary vanilla esters and light caramel standing up to the challenge.
"
1," Solid, mahogany body, creamy head of beige foam. Aroma and flavor both show notable yeast. Slightly tannic and acidic in flavor but balanced out with some raspberry like sweetness. A touch of oak may have been the cork, as I left this on its side for over 6 months. Sweetness lingers well into the aftertaste again ressembling raspberries, drying out as it lingers.
"
1," Bottle. Brownish pour with a monster foamy light tan head. Aroma is yeast, caramel, and light apricot. Body is semi light but creamy. Some carbonation. Flavor is also caramel malt with a touch of fruit acidity. Nice brew.
"
1," Red and slightly spicy.  Very nice aroma.  Very much like the Chimay Bleu but not really as good.  A bit stickier and maltier.  Still a quality beer.
"
1," Side-by-side of the regular draft and the cask version, at the brewpub, pre-Noogfest. Pours blackish brown with tan head. The aroma is slightly roasty with some char and bitter chocolate, and the cask version sports a bit of woody sweetness. The flavor is roasty bitterness with some dry hoppiness and a little bit of root flavor. Lactose sweetness is more evident in the cask offering, as is a bit of vanilla and wood. Both are pretty drinkable.

1," Bottle - 0,33l. Dark brown colour. An off-white lasting head. Malty aroma. A rounded, oily impression. Complex taste with hints of roasted malt, fruits and yeast.  A lasting finish with some bitterness. Some sediments.
"
1," A minor dissapointment every time Ive tasted it. Maybe my expectations have been too high? Its better than most brews, of course, but theres a bit too little of everything in it.
"
1," Bottle.  Poured a two finger width, creamy white head.  Very nice deep golden color with a hazy body and attractive clouds of yeast.  The aroma is nice, but lacking - some wheat malt, a bit of bready yeastiness, but not much else.  The flavor is again light on wheat, a touch of spice and a bit of hay as I exhaled.  Slightly sweet finish with some mild bitterness.  I really like the body - medium, creamy, but soft carbonation.  Overall a decent wheat - its strongest suits are the appearance and palate.  A different yeast would probably do wonders for the aroma and flavor - more phenols and esthers would be a good contribution.

"
1," Floral aroma, very light and nothing out of place. Its dark and cloudy and reddish brown, with brewed in the bottle particulates. The flavour is smooth and easy with the end flavour being the most prevalant in the aftertaste. The first part of my red, white and blue day of chimay.
"
1," (draught - Disney Boardwalk) red - brown with off white head. Crystal malt and citrus hops aroma. Flavor is malt with some hops.
"
1," On tap at the Disney World location.  Pours a translucent yellow with a small white head the left slight lacing.  Aroma was light, grassy, crisp and grainy.  Flavor of corn, grass, sweet malts.
"
1," Extremly light aroma slightly malty. Brown color with a small white head. Very smooth flavor. Carbonation sharpness to the finish.
"
1," @Disney World-on tap-pours brown/dark copper with a red tint and a tan head that laces. Aroma of light malt-caramel.  Taste is medium malt-caramel/nutty/brown sugar, 2nd spice hop bitter. Medium bodied with good carbonation.
"
1," A bonus from a trade I did with StFun.  The pour was copper and ever so slightly hazy with a barely off-white head that produced thing rings of lacing.  The aroma was some caramel malt, pine hops and pepper.  The flavor was spicy, peppery hops steamrolling over an overmatched caramel backbone.  Succinct finish and relatively light in body.
"
1," 750ml bottle. Banana, spices, yeast and alcohol aroma. Malt is there but quite subdued. Not full bodied with alcohol very noticeable despite strength. Over carbonated and dissapointing.
"
1," Well, this is good.  Pours nice copper red with bodaceous full head.  Smells sweet and musty.  Tastes of pepper, spice, sweet malt predominate.
"
1," The coffe aroma filled my nostrils with delight.  The opaque black body supported no head.  The palate was tingling my tongue and teh flavor was rich, full, and nutty.
"
1," Cloudy dark  copper colour with a beige head. Not overly carbonated. Flavours of dark frut and slightly spicy.  Well balanced. The alcohol content gives a pleasant warmth but is not overbearing.  A lightly bitter and spicy finish. A very smooth and flavoursome  beer but not quite as good as the blue.
"
1," sample @ pub, rather thin no much of spice background we see a lot in this category of beer, rather dull.
"
1," pours a medium dark brown with a big head intially, good lacing, medium carbonation.  Aroma is dark fruit, some carmamel, sweet malt, some roast.	Taste is about the same with a tart palate, like slightly sour fruit, and some phenolics.

1," From a bottle this poured a red to brown with a very large and billowing head that left good lacing in my Chimay glass.   Nose of fruit and some hops.  Very rich mouthfeel.    Flavor is simply divine, and finish is crisp and clean.  Superb beer.

"
1," 750mL bottle dated 11/06.  Brown pour with a tall fizzy off-white head that fades quickly to a loose ring.  Smell is dominated by banana esters with some nuttiness, roast, and a touch of alcohol and flowery perfume.  Flavor is a lot of roasty, sweet malt and dark fruit finishing with some banana and a fair amount of alcohol.  Medium body with a little too much carbonation and an oily finish.
"
1," bottle, courtesy of pivnizub. Clear dark amber-brwon colour, small head. Sweet and malty start, becoming dryer towards the finish. Hints of caramel and cocoa powder.
"
1," JUN 26, 2005 This beer rose to popularity when it was one of Garys best brews.  These days, its fallen on hard times.  Hazy yellow colour.  Fairly fruity (peach), phenolic aroma.  The flavour is malty, but less defined than in the Lohin days.  Lightly fruity with a hint of spice.  Tiny touch of hop dryness in the finish but otherwise quite sweet.
"
1," JAN 8, 2007 2002 version jan.2007."
1," Pours black with a fair tan head that stays well. Aromas of oak, slight bourbon, some chocolate, and a little vanilla.  Flavor is oak, bourbon, chocolate, roasted malts, and some vanilla. Really not bad flavor at all but what takes away is the over carbonated palate with thin body..  A little more malt and this one might be worthwhile..
"
1," Deep red-brown body, thick tan head. Bready nose with abundant esters. Spice and biscuit. Doughy body with sweet breads, toffee, plum, and surprisingly sharp alcohol. After warming, apple skin begins to become noticeable, but not so much as I remember in Chimay Blue. The prickly alcohol isnt carried especially well by the body, which is my sole complaint. Otherwise, I was pleasantly surprised by this beer.

1," Bottle @ taste 10 cl. Dark brown with a reddish tint with a medium off white head. Aroma of dark fruit, malt and yeast. The taste is slightly fruity with notes of banana

1," bottle. Clear pale yello, mid-sized ead. Fruity nose. Beery with hints of lemon. Refreshing and spritzy.
"
1," Sweet roasted caramel maltiness s the prdominant flavor upfront...a surprisingly heavy malt bottom.  But the PNW hopping quickly takes the upperhand and  delivers a punch of earthy/floral notes and citrus/grapefruit highlights.   Nicely brewed and very, very sessionable!
"
1," Bottle shared by Jason. Thanks dude!  Pretty uninspiring ""Belgian"" here. Roasty, coffee, light cocoa, nuttiness, slightly water,  weak yeast character. Had this towards the end of the night, but it didnt leave a lasting impression.

1," DEC 27, 2010 ""Mandarin Orange Amber Ale is a succulent, robust, welcoming amber ale so refreshing its like running naked through the snow!""	Yah, right! I dont think so! Unfortunately the moderate malty character overpowers the orange fruit flavour... too bad.

1," smooth texture, soft carbonation, a slight wine-like feeling, but retaining a nice bready, biscuity backbone. I could taste lots of figs, apricots, and some small bits of smoke.
"
1," A nice pour with a decent head. Creamy and sweet tasting with a mid-bitter finish. One of my favorite beers.
"
1," Pours a beautiful orange amber with a one inch off-white head. Aroma is a great balance of floral/herbal, citrus hops with a touch of caramal malt. Not as strong as it could be. Flavor is surprisingly balanced--great floral front hop (slight grapefruit--not too much), a complex nutty, caramel malt background, followed by a moderate bittering finish.  Not too bitter; not too sweet. Mouthfeel, for this size beer, is has a pleasant unexpected stickyness. I concur with many that this makes a great session IPA in an age of big beers.
"
1," Pours a cloudy, reddish, cola brown with a thin tan head. The aroma is subtle, with a sweet, yeasty character and an undertone of alcohol. The flavor is both fruity and earthy, with notes of raisins, dried cherries, and other dark dried fruits, and a biting combination of yeast and spice. Highly effervescent like the Red and a bit thin in the mouth, but still creamy and smooth nonetheless. At 9% alcohol and with a hint of alcohol in the nose, I was afraid of the booze taking over, but this one is warming without being harsh.
"
1," SEP 29, 2005 Bottle. Pours a cloudy light brown with small  frothy tan head. Very fizzy. Aroma is brown bread, fruit and a bit of yeast. Flavor is tart, spicy with a slightly dry finish, with some honey sweetness in there & a tiny bit metallic as well.  Gives a pleasant alcoholic tingle after finishing.

1," 11.20 oz bottle. Pours dark brown color with a small light brown head. Sweet malt and caramel aroma. Sweet malty taste with bitter after taste.

1," This pours darker than the White, but it maintains a similarly smooth flavour and really goes down smooth. A bit less body than other Chimay beers, but it just as clean and satisfying, a very good choice.
"
1," great head, all you want, big thanks to the dublin whole foods market guys for suggesting this oe, thanks KEITH and COREY
"
1," Murky, nearly opaque brown body with a half an inch of light tan head. Fruit and caramel dominate the aroma with hints of spice, though the smell is not as strong as expected. Flavor has a fruity character to it, sweet, similar to apple, with spices and alcohol playing minor roles as well (the alcohol is almost non-existant). Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied, a bit lighter than I thought itd be. Extremely drinkable for the complexity, richness and abv of this brew. Not my favorite, but definitely one of the better brews from Belgium I have had.
"
1," Bottle. Fruity, very yeasty, also a light smell of coriander and also some bread. Large white rocky head, long lasting and a clear orange body. Light acidic taste, short duration. Light body, dry and light creamy texture, soft carbonation. Good summer beer.
"
1," Pours a dark brown color with a tan 2 finger head that seems to last. Smells like a Belgian, Dark Sweet Malt, yeasty, bready aroma, dark fruits of some kind get a bit of alcohol as well. Taste is extremely flavorful! Get that sweet dark malt I was smelling. Seems like im getting different wonderful flavors on all parts of my tounge, front, sides, middle and back. Sweetness up front, getting some bitterness on the sides of my toungue, and then a little of the alcohol in the back of the mouth. Mouthfeel on this is out of this world. The only way to describe it is that it is Velvety smooth, starts soft on the tongue and I thoroughly expected it start to feel watery but it never did, smoothest beer I have had to date. Its and odd sensation actually - I know I took a drink of the beer, but then all of the sudden its not in my mouth anymore, its like it snuck its wasy over my tongue and down my throught without me know it, that is precisely how smooth this brew is, Vanishes from my mouth without me knowing it!		Overall this really is a beer that lives up the hype. I had this beer for the first time tonight in honor of my wedding anniversary, and I think I might have just started a new tradition...

"
1," Dark brown with a very thick head. Very minty aroma. Interesting flavour. you can taste the mint and the chocolate. but it does not meld well with the rest of the beer. it clashed very hard with the natural malt flavour. A very interesting Idea but poorly executed . The flavour is bitter and un appealing.  Flavour. like burnt asperagus.
"
1," smooth and semi-sweet. The hops provide a juicy, grassy, herbal bitterness but also some hints of soap. All in all, this is acceptable.
"
1," SEP 4, 2006 Disney Boardwalk. On Tap. Everything a red should be, this is smooth silky version with ample hops (perhaps more than usual for the style) and a nice spicy quality. Malt is slightly sweet but backs off quickly towards the finish. The nose is full of caramel malt. Great with a burger.
"
1," Dark Brown.  complex nose, with fruit notes and a hint of chocolate.  Taste is very complex and includes fruit, chocolate, coffee, and toffee.  Wonderful beer.

1," Draught at the Hamilton Place location. Pours bold brownish red with off-white head. The aroma is malty sweet with maraschino cherry, almond, fruity sweetness, and just a touch of alcohol, and yogurt-covered raisins.

1," Rich brown colour with aroma of leather. Very strong and rich taste. Nice drink - a meal in itself - but very high in alcohol.

"
1," Bottle (750ml).  Poured hazy deep reddish-brown with an average (for the type) lasting tan pancake-batter head.  Clove, coriander, other spices merge with yeast, light roast malt and sweet fruits for an appealing aroma.  Taste is quite tart apple, spices, some alcohol and hop (?) bitterness, very mild roast malt and yeast - finishes quite bitter.  Mouthfeel very lively, a little thin;  gets very moreish as it warms, it mellows out and the harshness abates.  Solid ""4"" in my book.

"
1," Draught in Nashville.  Pours dark brown with a medium creamy and foamy tan head with lined and spotty lacing.  Caramel chocolate malt aroma, medium roasted.  Sweet caramel and semi-dark chocolate malt flavor, light acidity, coffee and yeast notes near the end.  Dark and full bodied, smooth palate.
"
1," This poured a deep reddish-brown with an enormous sudsy light brown head.  The aroma is yeasty and malty with some hot spices.  This has a rich roasted malt flavor with a heaping of nutmeg and some heavy peppering.  Strong alcohol presence... quite the warming drink.  Pleasant, warm & spicy finish.
"
1," Pours opaque brown with a thick, creamy tan head. Very light aroma, but fruity without the citrus. Apples, with a bit of flowers as well. Doesnt have the sweetness and great flavor of most quality beers this dark. Dont get me wrong this beer is still fantastic, but not as good of a drink as the red label which I love.
"
1," Pours a cloudy medium-brown with a foamy off-white head. Aroma is raisin, cherry, apricot, and mildly yeasty. Taste is not as sweet as expected, given the frutiness of the aroma; its actually somewhat bitter and alcoholy. Palate is creamy and rich, with a bitter finish. Not my fave double.
"
1," Bottle 330 ml 2005. Deep brown almost opaque body with a tinge of red. Frothy tan head. Very aromatic, dominated by fruit, caramel and yeast. A variety of  malt flavors along with dark fruits like raisins and prunes, spices like black pepper and clove makes this a powerful and complex beer. Full body. Alcohol is present, but not offensive at all. Smooth and silky mouthfeel. Nice dry and delicate hoppy finish.	Some will claim that this beer is overrated and past its prime. Well, Ive enjoyed it for two decades now and I still love it.
"
1," Bottle 0,33l.  Dark golden coloured with a tanned head - lasting for a while. Spicy aroma. Soft mouthfeel. Malty flavour. A bit unvaried but an OK beer. Some sediments in the bottle.
"
1," Aroma - nuts, malts, plums. Appearance - Dark brown with fizzy head that leaves a small layer behind. Flavor - plums, dark fruit, sweet malt and a touch of light chocolate. Palate - medium body, creamy, average carbonation, astringent. Overall - very good beer that hides the abv very well. Sweet but not overly sweet with a nice astringentness that makes you keep sippling. Like a much more concentrated Chimay Red.
"
1," Not as good as the blue.
"
1," If you havent tried any of the Chimay beers, than WTF are you doin on Ratebeer???
"
1," (bottle) Cloudy, orange-golden colour with a loose medium-sized and slightly off-white foamy head. Yeasty and slightly sour doughy malty aroma with notes of sweaty hops. Slightly sour flavour, light bodied with a moderate carbonation. Slim and subtle yeasty-fruity malty taste with a tinge of hops and barnyard in the background; slightly sour and minimally bitter finish with delicately grainy notes in the aftertaste. Somewhat refreshing and rural brew but not overly convincing. 14.VIII.11
"
1, april 2005 	Head
1," Bottle. Pours with a huge tan coloured foamy head over a garnet-brown body. Effervescent. Aroma of plums, sour cherries, with cake like sweetness and a spicyness (coriander?). Sweet in the foretaste with a bakground of gentle bitterness emerging in the aftertaste. Medium bodied. Nice.
"
1," Pours amber with thin white head that goes away quickly. Notes of raisin and plum in this, but very light on those. Hits the palate with a pretty strong dry flavor, that finishes clean.
"
1," A little less than the blue for me. Deep copper color, sweet, nice malt flavor.
"
1," Deep mahogany color, average head and lacing. Citrus aroma with a background of floral hops, licorice, banana, clove, bubble gum. Very complex flavor, very active carbonation but a smooth caramel finish. Bitterness in the end is present and a creamy mouthfeel. A very complex and satisfying belgian beer.
"
1," ENBF. Pours black with a brown dissipating head. Aroma of roasted malts and plummy fruit. Medium bodied with soft to medium carbonation. Flavor of chocolate, dark roasted malts, raisens, and red wine. Dry and oaky finish. Not bad
"
1," Sampled on 1/1/2009. This European Strong Lager pours a medium orange gold color from a 500ml green bottle. Small to medium sized white foamy head. The aroma is cereal, grain, corn, touch of malt and chemical with the residual skunk. A medium bodied Euro Strong Lager. The malts are cereal and grainy, with tons of adjuncts. The hops are earthy and slightly spicy.  ACK!!	This beer is a sweet mess of malts, adjuncts, chemicals and green bottle skunk, finished with a touch of hops. As bad as this beer is, and at this point it is pretty much non-drinkable, I have had worse. Nice carbonation. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet with a touch of cardboard and dead dog. Drain pour!
"
1," bottle ..deep brown pour small wispy head that leaves quickly. aroma of sweet dark fruit . sweet malt flavor but also some roasted notes and alcohol . very smooth and decent carbonation .	dry finish . good stuff

1," JAN 23, 2010 Colore rosso vermiglio profondo con una testa vivace.Aroma fantastico della spezia, della quercia, dellerba e del miele dolce.Grande sapore di spezie,della quercia,cannella.Leggermente amara nel finale.Favolosa.
"
1," Pours a deep brown color, with a thick fluffy browinish cappucino head.  Cloudy to the point I cant see clearly through my shaker glass (yeah yeah wrong glassware, but when in college you dont spend any extra money, you borrow from drinking establishments around town).  The aroma is cofee, figs, chocolate, molassas, caramel, grapes, brown sugar, to name a few.  Lots of aromas, none too overpowering, all nice and mild, yet complex.  Quite wonderful.  The flavor isnt as strong and complex as the flavor, but very good.  Milder than I thought it would be, but nice.
"
1," On tap at the Stogie and Stout event, 2008 edition.	Pours pretty darn dark with nice half inch to three quarter inch firm mocha head and spotty lacing. Looks like a nice beer. The aroma is fairly strong with roasty malts mixed with toffee followed by burnt malts. Very pleasing combination. The taste is bold like the aroma with roasty malts and toffee followed by burnt malts to midway. The beer sort of trails off and becomes a bit thin as the finish approaches. In the after taste a nice roasty and toffee maltiness lingers.
"
1," Draft at Chattanooga location. Hazy orange in the glass with a creamy off-white head that produced light lacing. The aroma was hoppy with lemon, floral, and bread. The flavor was of oranges, bread, and caramel. Light body with a bitter aftertaste.
"
1," Bottle from Spinnakers Spirit Merchants, VictoriaPale and hazy yellow color, small head. Light aroma of malt, very light chamomile, lightly citrusy too. Lean body and dry mouthfeel; mild but pleasant malt flavor, lightly biscuity and grainy; correct bitterness, the hop also carries some fruity trace.Simple, but refreshing.
"
1," Draft in Chattanooga w/ Shag/Clash. Poured a dark amber to copper color with a nice initial head, decent lacing. The aroma was light roast, some caramel. The flavor followed suit, although mixed in and underneath was a corny adjunct flavor that started to get annoying by mid-glass. The first half of the glass was drinkable, probably the best of the four I did at BR Chattanooga (although not lager crisp, even had some fruity ester notes over top of it), but with warmer temperatures, I couldnt get past the adjunct flavor in each sip. Imbalanced clearly to the malty side of things.
"
1," Pours a dark brown/almost black cola color with a fizzy carbonated head that diminishes in the blink of an eye. Roasted aroma has hints of liquorice, and dark fruits. Flavor his sweet and spicy that tingles the thin mouthfeel. I did find it very refreshing and good. I was just disappointed with the appearance since it literally looked like I was drinking a flat Coke or Pepsi with no ice in my pint glass.
"
1," NOV 9, 2005 Nice aroma, very cloudy/red with typical clear/white head.  A little metallic aftertaste but nice entry.
"
1," Poured a dark brown with a massive tan head very carbonated with bubbles cling to sides thur out session aromas of roasted malts,coffee,vanilla,bourbon and hops taste of the same a very well balenced brew my first from this brewer who I wasnt expecting much from but they floored me
"
1," FEB 19, 2009 Vintage 2007- 0,75l bottle. I have mercy again...Beautiful hazy reddish-brown body, delisicious beige head. It has the aroma of caramel, dried fruitsl, roasted malt and yes, some top-fermentation yeast.The flavour is sweet raisins and chocolate with nice spices, fine fruity things and the good balanced roasted taste of malt.Aftertaste of caramell and raisins. Thank you monks!	And thank you again for the vintage 2008"
1," range brown color with quite thick and smooth off-white-beige head. Pleasant sugary aroma is fruity, yeasty and some kind of spicy. A bit sweet Flavor is fruity and yeasty with some spicyness. Palate is full-bodied, foamy and quite much carbonated.

1," Bottle at Fall Beerfest In Toronto 2004.  Near black in colour.  Aroma of bourbon, some chocolate roast, alcohol.  Flavour of bourbon, sugary sweet, light roast, some toffee, a little buttery.  Lightish body, medium carbonation.  Finishes smooth, medium length.  Not too bad
"
1," Belgians are always unique beers.I cant beleive i havent tried this or the blue yet but have tried many others and has been a while.If anybody was new to these they would be surprised how good complex and differnt beer can taste.Even though it reminds me of wine somewhat its very pleasing in taste aroma and effect.I respect a beer that can age well is unpasterized and healthier has a unique taste and never that weird yeast aroma that i find in many good and reputable ipas.The aroma is great complex smelling of sweet grain fruit, cherrry maybe some other dark berry overall a unique smell you will never smell until experiencing this.Taste is similar with dark cherry like smooth malt sweetness.Sweet and somewhat dry barely sticky.	 Color was brownish red and hazy from the yeast.Not big in head but carbonated well.Finishes with a faint tart fruit like mildly spicyness all balanced.Giving your mouth a big party of flavor.Cant wait to try that blue!	 Screw those cherry stouts or fruity flavored beers this is the real kind of fruit that wont turn you off like those.Coming from someone that does not like any of those fruit type beers too.
"
1," Bottle.  Deep, translucent red and orange color with a large semi off white head.  Yeasty bread aroma with just a hint of fruits showing up.  Fruity flavor with, some sweetness, and some clove-like spice.  Medium bodied.  Prefer the blue and white to this, but it is still pretty solid.
"
1," Bottle pours a mildly cloudy golden orange color with a thin white head.  Good lacing along the side of the glass.  Aroma consists of mostly yeast, sweetness, bananas, biscuit, alcohol, and spices.  Flavor is a nice mixture of malts and hops.  Dry finish.  Very lively carbonation.
"
1," Bottle courtesy of SoLan. Pours black with tan head. Roasted malt and dark fruit aromas. Flavors of dark malts and slight hops. Medium body with lively carbonation.
"
1,"	Bready cereals and a spicy hop kick coalesce in this clean, lean and highly drinkable Bock.		Further Personal Perceptions"
1," I dont think that there is anything that I can say that hasnt already been said.  Deep, rich, and satisfying.  Truly an excellent beer.
"
1," Poured from 750ml bottle a burnt red-brown with large creamy tan head and lots of carbonation bubbling.  Aromas of dark fruit, yeast, brown sugar, and light banana.  Flavor pours in when this beer hits the right temperature.  Brown sugar, raisin, fig, plum, banana, wheat, malt, yeast, an acidic spiciness, and a bit of dough.  The finish is warm with alcohol.  The alcohol is overwhelming when the beer is colder, but nice when the beer warms.  Overall, a top of the line beer, easy to find, and one Il drink anytime.
"
1," AUG 12, 2011 Rating is based on aged bottles, ranging from 2 years old to 10 years old. Aroma is spicy, port-like, prune, roasted and chocolat malt. Sweet taste, port, alcohol-burn. Lingering palate, lasting forever. Delicious!	The un-aged version of this beer is not so pronounced, more chocolate and bit more creamy. Still a very good beer, but it only gets better with age. Not aged it will score a 3.6 in my opinion.
"
1," Received this as part of a Chimay gift pack that included Chimary Red, Blue and Tripel.  Pours a deep nut brown wit a beige foamy head that persists for a while.   The beer has creamy texture with a medium long finish.  Overall, a full and tasty beer.
"
1," Defintely veers toward the malty end of the IPA style and, to tell you the truth, at 5.6% ABV, I think Id just go ahead and call this a pale ale--not that that is a bad thing at all. Slightly hazed orange color with a small, foamy head. Something about the hops/malt balance in this beer reminds me of an American  barleywine though, of course, at a much more moderate level. The malts are more dominant but the hops are strong and cant be ignored. Its sweet w/ melon and pine hop notes along w/ a gentle iced tea astringency. By the end of my glass I am definitely ready to say that this is not an IPA but, whatever it is, I like it just fine. Its well balanced in its own way and while its not the most vibrant thing in the world, I cant complain about anything.
"
1," I like the white and blue better but the coppoery cololr and balanced palate make it a decent pick.
"
1," Hazy very dull beige and a little bit of frothy head.  Light coriander and vague malts on the nose.  Vaguely malt-accented, with light vague fruitiness and light spiciness.  Not really getting the toasted coconut.
"
1," Bottle share with cmr1517 and my brother-in-law.  Pours a murky reddish-brown with a diminishing creamy white head.  Strong belgian yeast and caramel scent throughout.  Tingly malt taste with a strong, sweet alcohol finish.  Very good and will stop looking over it when I out bottle shopping.
"
1," SEP 23, 2010 Bottle (33 cl) from Systembolaget. Dark cloudy brown with a thick and firm beige head. Earthy malt aroma with dried fruits, a little burnt sugar and yeast as well. Smooth mouthfeel, alcohol, sweetness and bitterness are extremely well balanced.
"
1," Red in color, fruity peach or apricot aroma, tastes a little of spices, malty, not to sweet. Important that the proper glassware is used when drinking this beer.
"
1," Small Bottle..Chimay goblet pours hazy amber with a light tan creamy head.Funky smell almost like over ripe fruit that has fallen to the ground very earthy but fruity.The Taste is very rich as it should be(at $8.00 a bottle)  .It is a nice malty taste with the presence of mulled spice and yeast notes blending for a unique taste.	Its somewhat thin in body but the carbonation makes for smooth drinking.
"
1," Half pint, cask by traditionally Scottish air pressure dispense at The Bow Bar, Edinburgh. Clear, amber body. Missing head. Floral smell. Fruity taste with a touch of salty water. Dry and smooth in the mouth  almost like old books, but quite easy to drink 24.10.2008.
"
1," Yellow, darker than the light (in the category of stating the obvious).  Buttery aroma, German hops, Saaz front, lightly metallic finish but that goes away as my palate warms to it.  Some butter in the finish.  Drinkable. (on tap, Rock Bottom Atlanta)
"
1," Pours an attractive cloudy brown with nice head.  Aromas are sweet and spicy.  Flavors are quite complex, tipping the scales  to a somewhat darker flavor than the other Chimays.  Somewhat heavy, kind of meaty almost, and quite smokey.  Finish comes off with a much lighter sweetness with a tinge of sourness.  Quite complex and fun to analyze.
"
1," Strong Coffee and Malt - I really like this flavor - very similar to the Bourbon Barrel Aged Oatmeal - (I will have to try the two at the same time to compare) I think I liked the flavor of the Bourbon Aged better.  This is a good brew
"
1," Very heady beer that flattens out and warms up quick. The taste is exceptional and the finish competes for your attention. Definitely the better of the chimay platoon.
"
1," one of my favorite beers.
"
1," poured  clear yellow with a medium white head. Light Hallertau hop aroma. Flavor is crisp at first and finishes with moderate corn. Mild bitter finish. Light butter but nothing offensive. Fairly good.
"
1," Quite good after about 9 months of lying down.	Lighter than the near-black color would suggest.
"
1," This is one of my favorites.  Sweet and fruity.  Banana, pear tangy, smooth, thick.  Floral nose.  Not boozy despite the high alcohol.
"
1," I poured this one in a tulip glass ans it held the almost to the end of the glass. Great yeasty, malt taste. nice carmal color, even with the 9 % alcohol it is not overwelling.  As for the price...5.00 dollars for glass of beer, this one was worth it.
"
1," Deep ruby red colour with a fizzy white head giving a good lacing. A wonderfully deep rich aroma of plums, cherries, fruit cake, roasted malt and nuts dominates with slight spice. Reminds me  of christmas mulled wine.  This beer is full bodied with lip-smackingly rich fruits, roasted malt and caramel with a delicate spice to the tongue. The complexity of flavour is fantastic ending ona dry finish making me want more. Definiety my favourite chimay.
"
1," Dry hop aroma, although faint.  Overall not that bad, but rather lacking compared to most other IPAs.
"
1," Amber coloured with rouge sparks, cloudy, thin, but firm head; some fruitiness(bananas, vanilla) in the aroma, also yeast; slight fruity taste (bananas again) with shy tart bitter finish; quite light bodied (7% ABV !), a bit warming; well done, but all in all a bit disappointing"
1," This is truly the most beautiful beer I have seen.  Deep milky copper/bronze color with a fluffy eggshell colored head.  The aroma and flavor were dominated by yeast with malt flavors coming out as it warmed.  Great body and a delight to drink although I prefer the Bleu.
"
1," JAN 14, 2006 Corked Bottle"
1," Get the big bottle & a goblet and take your time.  As this beer warms in the glass, it changes in character.  Belgian candy sugar, spicy, slightly yeasty, complex & enjoyable sipping pleasure.
"
1," Dark amber pour with great fizzy head.  Aroma of yeast.  Sweet and yeast flavor with a fizzy palate.  Great beer.
"
1," Quite drinkable, and my favorite sake of about 4 tried so far. Quite like the unpasteurized one I had, this is delightfully sweet (walnut nut meat) and flowery. Very drinkable. The aroma components I just plain old can't get to (too much alcohol) but that alcohol presence is really barely detectable in the flavor. Yes!
"
1," Pours a brownish haze with red tint and a small head.  I expected more aroma from this, but the taste and smoothness makes up for it.  Easily drinkable beer, no bitterness, amazing taste, a bit tingly too.  Purchased in a three pack (Red, White, Blue) with glass as a seasonal package Id presume.  I will definitely try a ""full"" bottle in hopes for a better aroma, as of right now, that is all I see it lacking.
"
1," 12oz bottle from Orland Park Binnys single rack. Pours very dark brown with small tan head. Aroma is bourbon, oak, vanilla, chocolate and sweet caramel. Flavor is roasted malt, chocolate, oak, vanilla and finishes with a little caramel sweetness. Barrel brings a nice complexity to the table. Not sign of booze really. Pretty balanced and nicely done BA porter.
"
1," Aroma of toffee and caramel.  Smooth, thin, caramelly mouthfeel with some burnt toffee in the finish.  Has some faint suggestions of toast as well.
"
1," 12 oz bottle.  Golden color, small white head.  Aroma of strong white pepper and malt.  Taste is bittersweet and very malty.  Finally, a nice lager from a very interesting country.  However, I would stick to the brandy, since its fantastic!
"
1," MAR 25, 2007 A pretty good beer and at a reasonable price. The flavor has a apple fruitiness to it and overall it was a great beer

"
1," bottle. Deep cooper-brown color, with a big head, a little fizzy, long aftertaste.
"
1," Almost black colour.  Head is light but also rocky.  The aroma is a bit woody, roasty and chocolatey.  The body is way too fizzy and overwhelmingly woody.
"
1," Im not really sure what to say about this beer. It was pretty smooth and malty with a decent spicy/peppery taste. Im not sure that this is one Id buy again, but I did enjoy it.
"
1," Hazy, deep amber coloured, mid-sized, slowly diminishing tanned head, fruity (dark berries) and light roastmalty nose; moderate bitter-sweet flavour, very light bodied; fruity finish with a light acidity, some umbels in the aftertaste. Good, very light one.....
"
1," This one was a 750ml of the 2008 vintage. Im afraid I didnt leave it standing long enough and when I popped the cork all of the sediment on the bottom stirred up in the bottle so it poured with some serious chunks. A nice amber brown with a decent white head. Nose is complex with deep fruits, and sweet malts. Mouth is similar with some caramel sweetness and a bit of alcohol, though neither is overbearing. Nice, complex and well balanced. definitely worth revisiting.
"
1," FEB 5, 2007 Pours a deep waxy mahogany brown color w/ a full, semi creamy froth that recedes slowly to a clumpy lace. Aroma of rock candy, dried fruit and liver. Full nectar w/ ample residual effers. Mouthfeel is a bit clumsy w/ beachball effers clanging toether. Sweetnes factor is moderate w/ woodsy flavors, tobacco, ripe plums, slight rootbeer, dusty granite. Finish is long and bittered w/ peach pit. Very warming w  moderate flavors of alcohol.
"
1," DEC 23, 2008 I LOVE THIS BEER. IT SHOULD BE ENJOYED SLIGHTLY CHILLED IN ITS OWN SPECIAL GLASS OR SIFTER. IT HAS A DARK COLOR. THE TASTE IS A LITTLE FLOWERY WITH A PLEASANT AFTERTASTE. STRONG ALCOHOL CONTENT ONE OF MY FAVORITES AMONG THE BEST AVAILABLE BEERS IN NY AREA.
"
1," sample @ pub, nice golden color thin body a great combination of hop + yeast. The best beer they add on menu on that day I can only recommend.
"
1," High level of carbonation with a golden brown color.  Really needed to be enjoyed in a Trappist glass with a wide mouth.  A good amount of malts are present with a very delicate aftertast.
"
1," The color is dark brown with a large foam. 		Aroma is slightly burnt with hints of caramel and something I can not really decide what it is. 		The flavor is fairly strong and fairly sweet with fruity elements. Alcoholic is well hidden. After taste is ok.  A little too thin to get the highest score. Bitterness felt pretty mild. Suspect that the beer is getting better after 3-4 years of storage.
"
1," Bottle, 5.0%. Papery aroma. Hazy yellow colour, small frothy white head. The flavour is mildly yeasty, like an OK Zwickel. Medium bitterness, a bit rough, but OK.
"
1," Comfortable, lasting 1cm foam covers the dark, absolutely opaque golden body. Original cracker jack aroma with a finely extracted wheatiness and crushed bananas that blend into the caramel in a natural, but sweet medley. The mouthfeel shows an expanding carbonation that becomes a creamy, everlasting foam. Rather dry towards the end, but frankly toasty, almost charred fruitiness in the finish. Surprising and unique, but questionably good.
"
1," i love all the chimays!what can i say?!copper in color with a huge head.notes of hops and yeast.excelent!
"
1," 33 cl bottle. Pours with good sized, quickly dissapating off white head leaving some lacing and coppery amber color. Pleasant spicy floral aroma. Slightly dry smooth spicy flavor with a hint of alcohol and a touch of bitterness. Yeasty spice flavor lingers. I will have more of this brew.
"
1," 330 ml. bottle. Cloudy brown colour, with a head that dissipates too quickly and leaves almost no lace. Smells of dark fruits, caramel, spices. Body is a bit watery, and mouth has again cark fruits, plums, caramel and some spices. Its a bit of a deception to me when compared to Chimay Blue or White, everything is too soft. I may have to review again when I have another bottle, better the big one.
"
1," Dark reddish-black with a full head.  Slightyly sugary aroma, maybe some malt.  Flavour is warming with a cognac feel and pleasant bubbles.  Full bodied, more so than Red and more warming.  Brings in some ascending bitterness, coffee, chocolate, vodka and bitterroot as the sips accumulate.
"
1," Good Beet, will drink again... has warm...
"
1," #300. Never rated it though I drink it on a regular base. Nice reddish brown with a steady off-white head. Malts and red fruit in the nose. Fruity, fresh taste, good bitterness in the end. Not too sweet, wellbalanced. Full, creamy mouthfeel, maybe just a little thin towards the end (but not AT the end)this is one of the best dubbels..
"
1," This brew poured up a murky mahogany colored body with an enormous frothy head with amazing retention and lacing effects. Aromas of sweet malts, spices, and peppers. Flavors of the same along with cloves, dark fruits (dates and plums), and warm hints of chocolate. Medium-bodied with a dry finish and lingering aftertastes of sweet malts and spices. This brew improves as it warms after pouring.
"
1," garnet in color with nice sticky head. aroma of  spices and dark fruits, taste of plums with some peppery spices, and caramel malt. smooth and easy drinking, nice
"
1," Bire trappiste de couleur ambr, 9% dalcool, bouteille de 500mL, trs mousseuse et ptillante, saveur de caramel intense.
"
1," Poured a dark brown, red color with a light tan head that quickly diminished, leaving no lacing on the glass.  Aroma of sweet chocolate, vanilla, and bourbon.  Taste of chocolate, vanilla, smoke, and whisky.  The mouthfeel was full of carbonation, but overall, it was rather thin.
"
1," 12oz bottle.   Ruby red with a beige head.   The aroma hasa decent level of vague fruity esters with caramel and bread crust as well.   Very sweet flavor with brown sugar and some ripe and dried fruit.   Syrupy mouthfeel.   Big dried fruit and caramel thing going on, but to the point of unbalance.
"
1," I was told this was the best brew that Big River produced.	Medium brown color, average tan head.	Some malt in the aroma, but no rich maltyness or smoky notes anywhere.	The flavor was middle of the road sweet, with no real assertiveness.	Drinkable but very tame.
"
1," I've had this before and this isn't the best bottle I've had. Marks are adjusted accordingly. Cloudy brown with a gigantic white frothing head. Moderate lacing. Some sediment. I remember all the bottles at the LCBO this time looked a little weak, and the yeast looked a little mucus-y. Regardless I don't think the bottle had spoiled. Aromatic spicey, chocolate, fruity, soapy with notes of cherry scents. Prickley spiced flavours. Body is medium, relatively rich and bread crustiness is prevalent. Carries some yeasty sourness. There is a dominant flavour in the first palate (can't figure it out) which doesn't work for me. Not as complex as the white or the blue. Good none the less.
"
1," Just off white head over a very hazy mohogany/brown body.  There is a smokiness that I get from this beer at first sniff.  Whether it's supposed to be there or not, I'm not sure, but it is there.  Roasted grain is noticeable once it starts to warm;  yeastiness and dark fruits (plums);  smokiness is still there.  Fairly dry for a strong dark.  Starts a little malty sweet then turns decidedly bitter and dry.  Hop flavor creeps into the aftertaste.  Roasted grain is mixed into mid palate along with yeast.  Dark fruit seems to be missing from this one in the flavor profile and is not quite as complex as I'd hoped, but it's not a bad beer.  Carbonation is on the higher side and has a probably lighter than actual m/f due to that fact.  This one is not one of my favorites for this style.  It seems to lack a little complexity and all in all just doesn't really ""do it"" for me.  After reading some of the other ratings, I either have a bad bottle, or my taste buds are just off.  Anyway, I'll re rate at a later date if this beer proves to be different down the line.
"
1," Great color that is best described as rusted pumpkin. Head retention is unbelievable. Taste is barely sweet, and not too bitter- gives a mild overall feel. Mouthfeel could be more malty, but this beer comes off very smooth and drinkable. Good bitter aftertaste, decent malty aroma. Quite mild, but still a success.
"
1," DEC 26, 2010 Bottle 330ml. Top class beer. Aromas of dark fruit, apple, roasted malt, and earth. Flavour is predominantly sweet, with some balancing bitterness. Palate is syrupy, full-bodied, and highly carbonated, with an alcoholic finish. Dark red in the glass, the head is fizzy, and it disappears.
"
1," bottle, thanks to cavie, amber color with molasses , brown sugary aroma, flavor of watery tobacco and caramels, I wouldnt sit on the floor for this

1," MAR 2, 2011 Bottle (thanks to foppa78 for sending me this)...   Poured a dark brown with a light, khaki head.  Some oak, dark fruits, tannins, malt and caramel sweetness with a decent sourness creeping up.  Some light spice too with a thin palate that masked the alcohol nicely.

1," Ruby brown with a minimal off-white head. Aroma is strong roasted malt with dark fruit sweetness and alcohol. Flavour is similar with a some bitterness on top of the heavy fruit.
"
1," 12oz, courtesy of argo0.  Pours a medium head with little retention, big bubbles around the edges; filtered yellowish-golden.  Slightly skunky in the aroma, minerals (skunk eventually dissipates).  Light body, mineral quality, some sweetness, almost a hint of vanilla?, quick finish.  Unremarkable.
"
1," 50cl bottle from Sainsburys, Edinburgh. Gold with a thin white head; malty aroma; clean citrus malt flavour, sweet malty finish.
"
1," Copper colour; aroma shows ginger, lemon zest, caramelly malts.  Palate again brings ginger, but also a healthy dose of anise as well, alongside light crystal malts, maybe sarsaparilla, finishing spicy and sweet.  Pretty drinkable, considering how much I despise anise.
"
1," 330ml Bottle.  Last of my three beer Chimay vertical.  Pours a swamp water muddy brown with one finger cream head and minimal lacing.  Nose is dark fruits, spice, roasted malts.  Taste is much the same with some sugary flavors added. Medium, prickly mouth fee. A bit too sweet for my tastes, but a quality Belgian that I can appreciate its complexity.
"
1," I had high hopes for this one once i finally got my hands on it. I didnt find all the flavors described. In fact I hardly found any complexity to it. Maybe my bottle was too new. However, its still an awesome belgian...alcohol is hidden, no flavors are too strong or gagging. smells bitching and is great for sipping..gulping..bathing and with chocolate. Definite keeper to my repetoire
"
1," Bottle. Ruby color with medium lasting cream white head. Fruity malt and yeast aroma. Sweet malty flavour with notes off yeast.
"
1," Orange with a large off white head. Aroma was malty with caramel and hints of hops. flavour was malty with caramel and grassy hops towards the finish.
"
1," Pretty much similar to Chimay Blue, but a little less to it. Still has the spiciness to it. Dark reddish-brown in color. More drinkable than the Blue. Great stuff.
"
1," MAR 31, 2008 First ratingBottle at Bishops Arms in Sundsvall, Sweden. February 17, 2006.Dark brown color and a white head. Nice ""Belgian"" scent. Amazing taste that I cant really describe. A close to perfect beer!(This was as high as 4.7 I think for me in the beginning...)8/4/8/5/15=4.0Second rating(At a blind tasting)Shady brown color, tan head. Grainy, apple scent.

1," 33cl bottle. Deep red brown with nice cream head. Sweet fruit on the nose. Candy sugar on the tongue with a delicious hap bitterness. Dried raisiny fruit. This was delicious.
"
1," Beer pours (in Chimay glass) a dark orange-red liquid light penetrates easily with a generous amount of near virgin-white head that collapses quickly, but leaves a thin film.  Aroma is of decomposing straw, grass, vegetal, citrus lemon peel, and wet sandstone.  Flavor is a spicy citrus that gives way to a very smooth and very clean palate, not dry, leaving the mouth moist.  Feels good in the mouth.  Tastes better than it smells.  Sampled at 72 degrees Fahrenheit.
"
1," Quite good.  This is the 	beer I mentally recall when I 	hear the term mouthfeel.  However, it tends to be a bit inconsistent.  Theres occasionally a metallic aftertaste.
"
1," On draught at Scottys Brewhouse in Indy. Bartender gave us a pitcher instead of a single glass. I hate it when that happens! ;-)  Anyway, it poured a slightly hazy orange IPA with caramel malt and slight citrus in the nose. Taste was similar with additional sweet malt, almost like nutty grape-nuts. Great bitterness in the finish.
"
1," Deep hazy brown color and a foamy, long-lasting cream color head.  The aroma was yeasty with some mellow malts.  The aroma just screamed ""Belgian"" to me.  I had a very difficult time deciphering the flavor...I think my palate was a little overworked then night.  Il have to rerate later.  I sampled this alongside the Red Cap, and needless to say, the Blue is much bolder.  A little alcohol twinge in the finish, but still a very smooth beer.
"
1," Pours opaque brown with a thick, creamy tan head. Very light aroma, but fruity without the citrus. Apples, with a bit of flowers as well. Taste is difficult to put a finger on. Sweet, like cinnamon apples but wonderfully malty as well. Finishes pretty dry, but with a little bit of alcohol, hop, and malt. Mouth feel is nice and thick. Carbonation was perhaps a bit more active than I prefer in a beer that is this rich. Very subtitle and wonderful.
"
1," Bottle at Alex.	Hazy yellow coloured with a small white head.	Fruity aroma of spices, coriander and yeast.	Fruity flavour of spices, coriander, rubber and yeast.	Spicy finish.
"
0," Pretty boring, cant come up with anything to say about this beer after 15 of thuis kind.... Danm... just plain boring...
"
1," Bottle. Pours cloudy nutty brown. Medium off-white head. Leaves beautiful lacing. Smells of sweet caramel and definate fruityness. Tastes very fruity, no alcohol or bite at all. Nice and complex. Coats the palate beautifully.
"
1," 330 ml bottle in Germany. Nice reddish brown color with a medium nicely laced white head. The aroma is mostly fruity and malty. Nice fruity, malty and spicy flavors with a fruity/sweet finish. Light to medium body and an oily mouthfeel, lively carbonation. Although it is not up to its sisters quality, Chimay Bleu, it is a very good beer.
"
1," the first of the three Chimay, lightly fruity and very aromatic, its he standard to what all Belgian should be
"
1," Cloudy, dark ruddy copper colored pour with a tall nutty head.  Yeasty nose with some dried prune.  Very yeasty flavor as well and the texture is quite buttery.  This beer starts with a nice herbal hoppiness, and finishes with a touch of cinnamon and clove.  Very nice overall.
"
1," I love the stregnth of the beer but the fresh yeasty taste and light floral finish are the best.  Very pleasant to drink
"
1," Deep brown and coffee-like, this Chimay doesnt have, at least in my opinion, the range or the depth of the other Chimay beers. Its flavor tends more towards sweet and watery with a nutty, almost bitter finish. While certainly not a bad beer, just not what Ive become accustomed to from the Chimay line.
"
1," Wonderful brownish-red color. Not too pungent aroma, but the taste is powerful. Burnt candy, dark fruit and earthy, yesty tones. A classic beer.
"
1," The aroma was a well achieved melding of dark caramel, dark fruits and Belgian yeast spice presence. A fruity character with a bit of cork was present. The aroma exuded alcohol with the raisin and prune of the dark fruits. The beer poured into the chalice deep amber with a tannish head which rose slightly and fell quickly but laced at the glass. The flavor was nicely malty and crisp with toffee and dark caramel coupled with Belgian yeast spice which was slightly peppery, contained cinnamon and clove. the dark fruits from the aroma came through in the flavor and contained raisin and prune characteristics. The body was just above medium and with a moderately high carbonation the beer was creamy on the palate and in the mouthfeel. The finish was dry with lasting impressions of malt and spice into the aftertaste and beyond. A really nice Belgian Strong Dark Ale. 750 ml corked and bailed bottle.
"
1," Not my cup of tea. A great dark beer but pitty I dont like dark beers that much. I do like the aroma thoug, a bit fruity.
"
1,"   Cask, handpump at The Bell & Crown, Canterbury, Kent 16th July 2011 in company of Ian Harrisoni   Soft hoppy nose, good clarity, sprinkling of white bubbles. Soft but then there is a streaky bitterness, touch warm, this is really juicy, wonderfully juicy hoppiness. Good stuff.    A7 A4 T8 P4 Ov15  3.8 
"
1," pours a hazy brown/red thick head. tons of caramel and dark fruit in the nose. taste is layered and very complex. rum soaked dark fruit, black cherry, brown sugar, candi sugar, and a slight but not overpowering bitterness. warm with a little kick from the alcohol. long, malty, slightly bitter finish.
"
1," pours dark with a decent head. aroma is complex combo of riasins and prunes and things like that. taste is similar, nice and balanced, some citrus notes. body was a little lighter than i thought. but this was a great beer anyhow
"
1," 12 oz bottle from Pepsican. Nose is light citrus and very grassy, earthy hops mixed with a little malt backbone. Cloudy amber orange with a big lightly lacing beige head. Flavor is bitter with bits of lemon and grass along with a hint of coffee in the background.
"
1," yeast, brown sugar. Taste"
1," Pours darky murky brown with a little orange coming through in the light.  Thick, rocky, beige head that shrinks to a thin layer.  Good lacing.  Really mild aroma.  Sweet and a little spicy.  Dark fruits, banana.  Taste is surprisingly mild as well.  Gets sweeter and the roasted malts are more prevalent as it warms.  A pleasant beer to drink, a little dry.  I like.
"
1," bottle, thanks to Bochum! Clear amber colour, mid-size head. Creamy mouthfeel, very pleasant. Full-bodied, very malty with hints of brwon sugar and caramel. Reounded by some aromatic hops, which gives the beer a dry and hoppy finish with a malty background.
"
1," This beer rocks.	I am updating my score and comments because this is one of the first Belgian ales that I tried. Almost all Belgian ale enthusiasts have tried this beer so I wont go into a lengthy description of it. I am lowering my score from a perfect 5 since I have now sat down and seriously rated all criteria of the beer and found it unworthy of a perfect score... also, I have now tasted the Westvleterans, Rocheforts and Westmalle double and found them superior. I still love Chimay bleu.
"
1," Amber color with a big white head. Aromas of prunes, malt, fruits, caramel and yeast. Palate of malt, caramel, toffee, prunes, chocolate and hops.
"
1," Very light orange colour.  Light carmel malt flavour.
"
1," JUN 26, 2007 corked bottle"
1," bottle - pours dark amber-brown. Rich toffee, plum and spice-bread aroma that carries over to the flavor as well, slightly bitter finish. I prefer the Blue.
"
1," bottle poured a cloudy brown with a beige head. nice creamy mouthfeel You can smell the roasted malts and the fruity yeast. the taste of malt and hops is well balanced nicely hides the alcohol
"
1," Another great brew from Belgium.Do these guys ever take a break?A nice rustic autmn copper color with a foamy head that dissapates to a creamy texture.Very malty and hints of fruits and the alcohol was slightly hidden.The finish was clean with a little bit spiciness
"
1," August 2, 2011 Mode"
1," Dark red colour with thick cream head.  Ample carbonation and strong coriander nose, with some sweet malty and yeast nuances. Fairly complex flavour profile, buscuits, bread, sweet maltiness, coriander, sweet orange, etc.
"
1," From bottle. Fantastic aroma of spice, oak, herb and sweet honey. Deep ruby red with a lively head. Sweet flavour initially. Great flavour of sweet spice and oak, cinnamon. Silky texture, smooth yet tangy with a lively finish. Really enjoyed this beer and hit the spot on the occasion.
"
1," DEC 29, 2011 Very nice dark golden color. Great balance of malt and hops. This stuff is awesome off the tap and the bottle keeps the integrity of the beer very well.
"
1," Had this few times. Always like it but sometimes it was pretty well carbonated. I am not a big Dubbel fan as most brewers do not do a good job. So yeah, it did have some ripe pear flavor with some other flavors but overall, another Dubbel I can do without.
"
1," On tap at the brewpub (Indianapolis, IN). Pours a pitch black with thin tan head. Aroma is sweet and malty with notes of chocolate, nuts, bourbon, vanilla, cherry, ripe dark fruit, oak, some hints of brown sugar and toffee. Flavor is sweet and malty with notes of chocolate, vanilla, smoke, brown sugar, toffee, light bourbon, caramely sweetness. Medium to full body with a pleasing malty finish.
"
1," Draft. A clear yellow beer, white head. Malts and some grass in the nose. Light bread taste.
"
1," Very dark porterish colour with ruby and mahogany notes.  Has a thin light brown head.  Sweet blackstrap molasses and treacle aroma.  A vineous sherry-like aroma.  Cherry and black current fruitiness with port-like notes as well.  Not like any other brown ale that Ive had.  Tends to become cloying, but is still a well-crafted beer.  Based on the description Im reading I think this is a totally different beast from what others were drinking when it was still brewed at Sailor Hagars.
"
1," Bottle. Moderate malt aromas of roasted and nutty, light herbs for the hops, moderate notes of leather and broth for the yeast, with prune, wood, pepper and ahint of cola in the background. Head is fizzy, off-white, with a little lacing and is mostly diminishing. Color is hazy, but sparkling dark red/brown. Flavor starts lightly sweet and moderately acidic, then finishesmoderately acidic and bitter. Palate is medium, dry and watery, and it has a fizzy carbonation. Not as good as the blue and white but definitely an excellent sessoin beer.
"
1," rich caramel colour with brown/butterscotch ripple kinda colour and good carbonation. very dark fruits on the nose, plums, dates with a hint cloves and toffee.rich and thick on the palate with a rather spicy almost tannic finish. finishes with a little heat. rich caramel and toffee notes mixed in with a lightness that i cant quite describe. beautiful and complex stuff. it has a slight mellow character that i enjoy alot.
"
1," Drank from a 1 pt. bottle. Impressive bottle, pops like champagne when opening.  Pours a reddish orange color, with a unfiltered look to it, small white head.  Great aroma.  Carbonation is high.  Champagne is a perfect description of this beer.  In fact I think I may be popping a bottle of this in celebration instead of the bubbly!  Cider like in taste, apple and wheat, reminds me of autumn.  Fantastic beer. Will keep for toasting or celebration.
"
1," Pours dark brown with a cm of creamy off white head.  The aroma is sweet, and I detect notes of Belgian yeast, horse blanket, cheese, clove, dates, and a bit of pepper.  The flavor is moderately sweet, mostly of malt, but has a presence of coriander and and finishes with a lactose like taste.  The mouthfeel is nice and creamy.  This is one of my favorites.
"
1," I love Dead Frog and I immediately bought their 2.5 Anniversary Ale when I saw it in the store.		The color is great, amber with reddish hues.  It poured nicely and the aroma was that of a robust ale.		Mouthfeel is good, the taste is bizarre.  It starts off slightly smokey and finishes very smokey at the back of your throat.  This is the chipotle pepper of beers.
"
1," Pours copper with lots of carbonation and a large creamy head.  Aroma has caramel malts with some spicy / citrus hops.  Medium body with a nice amount of sharp carbonation.  Taste has some caramel, but it is mainly spicy hops.  The finish has even more of the spicy hops and comes across as prickly with the hops and carbonation mix.  A good pale ale.
"
1," pours red with a luxurious off white head and minimal lacing.  Aroma is boozy with yeast, bread and cranberry notes.  The mouthfeel is crisp and biting (lots of carbonation) but the body is full.  taste is yeast and cranberry with a hint of caramel.  finish is simple and bitter.
"
1," complex spicy and just beautifulk to watch in the glass. three distinct phases as it passes through the mouth with a long spicy palate that lingers. a symphony in the mouth. one of the top brews. life would not be the same without it.
"
1," Aroma is strong, malty, and spicy - very inviting. It comes out a dark and somewhat cloudy honey-brown, with a thick, pale beige head. Flavor is very toothsome, richly malty with hop hints and whispers of spice. Aftertaste has quite a bitter bite, but it is pleasant rather than nasty, like the kick of strong liquor. Unfortunately, the pleasant flavor does not persist and the alcohol bite dominates after it goes down. Still, it is an eminently drinkable ale.
"
1," Chimay is overrated in my book.  Sure, its ok--particularly if its the only Belgian on the menu.  But the depth of flavor really isnt there--its a bit too yeasty, too hoppy and not deep enough in the sweet/caramel side of the spectrum.
"
1," Has more of a dark coppery color, still very attractive.  Has a decent floral, fruity aroma, not overwhelming.  Has a semi-sharp crisp malt flavor. A little bitter somewhat dry, not as smooth as I would like. Fruit is not too noticable on the palate.  Where is that silky sensation?  Still a pleasant and drinkable beer.

"
1," Funny how this is retired and I drank it last week. For admin's info it is now contract brewed by Howe Sound.	pours a very dark amber color, creamy off white head.  A huge citrusy nose erupts from the nose with hints of sweet apples and caramel.  The body has great depth, juicy hops, apples,  cinnamon, hints of caramel is run over the tongue very smoothly. Orangish bitter off dry finish.  Superb!
"
1," MAR 13, 2004 Thick pillowy head. Amber brown Aroma of red wine,light yeast and apricot if you are looking for it. Silky smoothness. Alcohol warming in the back of the throat. Flavour is much more agreeable as my palate improves from my first tasting. Malty, dry, hoppy, slight earthy quality. Light notes of chocolate, licorice, alcohol.
"
1," Mild whiskey and oak aroma,some roastedness,these aromas fade quickly to a bitter chocolate,taste is a mild chocolate and coffee grounds tastevery smooth ,almost slick mouthfeel,not much of the bourbon in the taste,very pleasant succulent  brew,would not pay a ton of money for this. Thanks Kingpin

"
1," dark, with a white head that lingers in the glass while drinking.  A very nice smooth beer with a BOOMING big finish.  I drank mine icey cold which I believe excentuated the contrast between the taste and finish.  Those who like the after-taste, would adore this beer.  But those like me, who were somewhat indifferent to the finish, think this beer is over-rated.  Definately worth drinking, but dont drive to Belgium for it.
"
1," Clear yellow gold colour with thin white head. Mild malt nose with slight yeast hints. Sweet malt taste with mild bitter finish.
"
1," A deep brown colour, with a rich full fruit malt with a hint of chocolate and a little spice.
"
1," very nice trappist. 	nice and sweet, i would offer this a desert beer, hide the 9% very well. overall an excellent beer, lots of sweetness.......perfect for aging, will only get better with age.
"
1," MAR 10, 2003 This beer's complexity is in its simplicity.  There is no overload to the senses and this beer seems so unintrusive. Very nicely done without stepping all over your tongue. (I have re-rated this and have decided that this is a great beer. My first bottle had almost no head to speak of while this bottle poured a monstrous head. This was much fuller in flavor and just much better overall.) Great smell"
1," Can. Pours a pale amber color with a small off-white head. Has a fruity malty hoppy caramel aroma. Sweetish malty hoppy caramel flavor. Has a sweetish malty hoppy finish.
"
1," This was really a disappointing beer, especially when it advertises itself as a wheat. AThere was little, if anything, that reminded me of a wheat, and it will be easier to mejntion what it lacked, than what it had (which wasnt much).		There was no hazy color; no dough/wheat/spice in the aroma or flavor; no spicy/tingly mouthfeel; and no chewy/thirst quenching finish.		In short...it was like a BMC attempt to branch out to wheat. Shame on you B.I.
"
1," Bottle @ Dr. Bills.  The brewer name kicks ass.  Poured a hazy amber color with no head.  Dry spiced aroma with notes of fruit and leather.  The flavor was tart and fruity.  Big leather and notes of pear.  Light tingle of carbonation on the tongue.
"
1," Awesome, I had this last night with my bro, lots of alcohol but it isnt too overpowering. Medium-bodied,  subtle fruity finish, nice aftertaste.  If you want a challenge, try what my friends call the red, white, and blue.  Thats right, a tall of all three Chimays.  I love this beer!
"
1," Doesnt conceal its abv as well as some, but incorporates it better than most. Seems to be both strong and subtle, and very, VERY ghosty!	Quality, but my 2nd dose wasnt quite as good as the first. Il try it again soon to solidify my rating.
"
1," red brown color, foamy head, Medium bodied and wonderfully smooth velvety well balanced bitter-sweet-alcohol palate from start to finish, some woody flavours in there as well. Lighter flavoured than both the Blue or White but still a great beer in its own right. I think I prefer it over both the Blue or White
"
1," 750 mL corked & caged bottle with an apparent date marked on the cork of 11/05.  uncorks with a loud ""thomp"" and out seeps a bit of boozy caramel aroma.  poured in a stemmed chimay glass its medium-carbonated creating a smallish off-white head atop the amber-garnet and slightly hazy liquid.  prune, raisin, burnt sugars, clean yeast in the aroma and the flavor is similar - malty and sugary and a bit tannic and acidic.  a very well-executed and enjoyable beer, one of the best dubbels available.
"
1," A dark copper pour with little or no head. A mediciny bite with a raisin kicker not a lot of maltiness nor hops but a good flavor overall. Good carbonation and a prety good mouthfeel make it a solid palate.. Not bad for a brew chain Scottish Ale.
"
1," Bottle from Sainsburys. Strong sour fruity malt aroma. Medium brown colour. Very bitter grassy fruity flavour. Sour aftertaste. Yet to find a good beer from this brewery.
"
1," Bottle. Color was a reddish brown with a frothy medium head. Aroma medium sweet fruity tone. Flavor was full and smooth and had a long finish with an alcohol bite. Good brew.
"
1," Lightly grainy and sweet aroma is simple and clean.  Clear, deep, golden coloured body with plenty of bubbles topped by a thin but long lasting, fine bubbled, white head that coats the sides of the glass.  Pleasant honey sweetness and grainy malt character leading through to mild to fair finishing bitterness.  Light-medium body with decent effervescent carbonation.  Sampled on tap at Sophies Cosmic Cafe in Kits.
"
1," On tap at the brew pub...very clean/slighty fruity aroma.  Taste is light and smooth.  Hops almost non-exsistant, but I enjoyed this beer.  Great for hot days-
"
1," JAN 26, 2010 Lighter than expected. Dark with a nicely persistent foam but likely that goes down to a good level. Fruity, thick and a bit citrusy. Rather balanced.Good complexity but somewhat short and leaving me wanting for more.
"
1," NOV 18, 2003 Orange-brown color, malty and yeasty aroma (clove and alcohol notes). Taste is moderatly sweet, nutty and a little bit bitter, some acid. Aftertaste is alcoholic and a hint watery.
"
1," Pours creamy dark brown with 3 fingers of head. Malty grape flavor. Absolutely delicious!
"
1, Nearly opaque light brown color. One finger of frothy beige head with poor retention and a small ring of lacing.		4.0 S
1," On tap at Rock Bottom in Atlanta.  Poured a deep mahogany color with a small tan head.  Aroma of caramel, sweet malt and nuts.  Flavor was nutty with a bready malt note, along with a hint of hops at the end.  Medium body with mild carbonation.
"
1," 12 oz. bottle poured into shaker- poured nontransparent squid ink black, some tan bubbles around the glass for a head, low carbonation.  Aroma of cofee, well roasted malt, and dark toffee.  Hits the mouth with a high-medium body, coffee taste hits you like a freight train with no brakes right from the starts and lasts well after the finish, a note of cream on the end as it tails off.  Out of balance, but sometimes you need that from a beer.
"
1," Bottle. Hazy amber colour with large creamy white mostly lasting head. Malty aroma. Sweet fruity flavor. Oily palate.
"
1," Brown reddish with a beige frothy head, some visible carbonation, small beige lace.		S"
1," Pours murky reddish with white head.  Aroma of yeast and apple.  Also a metallic hint.  Tastes like yeast with fruit and malt. Finishes bitterish.
"
1," Fresh, somewhat sweet aroma with hints of fruit. Dark reddish amber in color with cascading lace. Intersting flavor. Soft, but appears heavier in alcohol than the other BR brews I have tried. Something amateurish, however. Overly carbonated, but a full-bodied brew and very good.
"
1," This is part of a beer club. Had only one bottle but was decent for the price. Poured great and had a nice finish. Would do again.
"
1," This beer is more carbinated then I expected.  The bubbles never stopped eminating from the bottom of the glass.  It is an enjoyable beer, but not one of my favorites.  Not as good as the red.  Pretty amber/dark brown color, and amazing head and bubblage.  Definately a great beer, but I felt like something was missing.  Not as complex as some of the other chimay beers.
"
1," Far less raisin aroma and taste than other recent Belgians Ive enjoyed. Subtle stuff way down in there, fruits I never knew existed, like the oddly-colored ones in the small baskets at the grocers...but also flavors of Coca Cola and clove, stronger than the rest. Coupled with the real thinness of body, I was a bit negatively surprised. I did expect something different, more. That being said, this is incredibly easy to drink, and one could(well, I could) get into serious trouble if this were more easily accessible.
"
1," I liked it better than the bleu too. You can tell its a belgian, but its like a light belgian without the massive notes of spices and malts, but more subdued and on par with a normal spiced up ale (if you can make sense of that). And I dont mean LIGHT, at 7 percent the alkee is still hidden. Perfectly balanced. The nose was this chewy yeasty vapor trail and  the taste was spice and malts. The finish amazed me with these caramel highlights and tastes. Really good.
"
1," Cask gravity, Hereford 2010. Dusty copper, beige film of head. Dank chocolate and nuts aroma. Walnut and pleasant dabs of butter; hay and caramel, good clean digestive afters. Good honest brown bitter- pleasant and a bit dull but nothing wrong with it.
"
1," MAR 11, 2008 Another excellent trappist ale, though maybe not as complex as others, has excellent alround body and flavour aroma. A strong flavour of wheat off of this, which is refreshing, as well as the spicey lightly fruity taste. 	One to try again defo.		Rating for a second time"
1," [cask at SRAF09, Edinburgh] Very light, golden pale ale with a decent white head  but one that recedes very quickly. Grassy, slightly sweet aroma. A touch soapy on the palate but has that bitterness of a decent golden ale  a pretty good start to the festival [25062009]
"
1," Very good.  Doesnt disappoint from start to finish.  Full bodied in palate and flavor.  Light bitterness in the finish.  Well balanced overall, good looking, nice aroma.  Thumbs up!
"
1," Bottle at Le Sous-Bock in Paris. Nice malt-driven flavours. Aromas of caramel, citrus, and hints of caramel. Taste is sweet, with sour notes, light bitterness, and long length. Palate is creamy and lively. Amber, cloudy, with a thin head.
"
1," Pours a dark amber with an off white head. Aroma, caramel, some earthy notes, pretty mild in aroma thought. Flavor, caramel, earthy, a bit nutty, some slight roastiness, very smooth.

1," 750ml Bottle. Pour with thick head, a dark red color. Malty yet sweet aroma. Taste fruity with a hint of citrus. Too drunk to give this a proper description.
"
1," 04 Bottle.  Pours brownish with red hints, and a solid head.  Strong Belgian yeast aroma, and some darker fruits like plums.  Nice full-flavored, but a bit thin when compared to quads.  Alcohol is fairly well hidden for 9%.  Nice enough trappist swill heh.
"
1," 33cl bottle.  Pours a cloudy brown color with off-white head, chunkies, and lots of fizzy co2.  Head retention is good.  Aroma is belgian yeast/minerals and slight fruitiness.  Taste is malty and fruity, raisin, apricot, caramel, and some spices.  Finishes dry and sudsy with a nice lingering slight bitterness.  Complex and well crafted.
"
1," Dark and opaque brown with a thin small layering of head.  Aroma is pleasant with malt and spice from a true Belgian yeast. Flavor is both sweet and bitter with flavors ranging from lightly toasted malt, sugar cane, brown sugar, figs, and a slight hint of vanilla. In the finish a perfect display of spices and hearty yeast
"
1," Bottle 500ml.Clear medium amber color with a average, frothy, good lacing, mostly lasting, off-white head. Aroma is moderate malty, caramel, nutty, light roasted, light to moderate hoppy, citrus notes.

1," Bottle. Dirty brown pours with a substantial, but diminishing tan head. The aroma is malty with notes of roasted malts, chocolate and nuts. Hint of metal.

1," This was the first style of Chimay that I ever tried.  I was overwhelmed after the first sip.  It is also incredible, but after trying the blue, the red just isnt the same anymore.  The biggest difference is the bite at the beginning of each sip.  It just isnt as strong as the blue label, plus the blue has a little more alcohol, which never hurts.

1," 1994!!! Grande Reserve 750ml	This beer has been kicking around my folks place for ages, I finally conned them into opening it. I knew that it would be past its best but its still an impressive drop. No head and totally flat it poured like a glass of port (not dissimmilar in aroma too). The complexity of the nose is amazing. Herbal almost medicinal in character, raisins soaked in brandy. The hue is from watery to caramel. Flavour is malt and alcohol driven. Alcohol bitterness is balanced on the finish by malt sweetness no hop bitterness at all. A nice clean dry finish. I prefer a younger example but none the less imperssive.
"
1," Draft at Rock Bottom Atlanta during the 4th of July Celebration with alexanderj and kleyland.  Ruby brown color.  Off white head.  Aroma of bready malt.  Thin and watery.  Flavor is malty with hints of chocolate.
"
1," Golden to deep golden, a bit hazy, lacy - medium-sized - white head; moderate to solid grainy-bready nose with some hops underneath; solid bitter-sweet flavour, medium bodied; increasing sweetness in the grainy-hoppy finish. Nothing to complain......
"
1," Dark reddish color with very good head. Fruity aroma. Caramel malty flavor.
"
1," Light, yeasty and crisp aroma.  Very dry on the palate - reminiscent of a dry champagne with yeasty undertones.  Some detectable fruit and malt flavor underscores the alcohol finish.
"
1," Just can not say enough about this beer. It has the head of champagne,the color of scotch, the body of a chianti, and the taste of mother earth. Its fruity and earthy and full of both aromas
"
1," Fruity, alcohol, Sisu pastilles. Taste"
1," WAW!  This is BELGIUM!  It is drinking so good with no fizzys.  I would like to being trappist monks.  Very special!  I think the fruit flavors are drinking like real fruit.  I do not drinking the alcohol!
"
1," Pours very heady out of the bottle, and the head takes a while to go down. It is a dark amber color and has good color density. It is hard to see through. The beer smells like sweet wheat and honey. It is a fairly crisp smell. It has a medium sweet wheat taste to it. It is distinctive and has good flavor density. The beer also feels very heavy and carbinated in my mouth. Overall, a pretty darn good beer. You should try it out if you like a belgian beer with some good flavor.
"
1," Bottle shared with HogTownHarry -- my bottle courtesy of lewis13. Pours totally black, theres no seeing through this puppy, with an average size diminishing light-brown head. Nice aroma of roasted malt and roasted coffee. Flavour reminds me of a coffee Porter but with more hops. Nice bitter roasty finish. Medium bodied, creamy mouthfeel. Very enjoyable.
"
1," From a cork top bottle. Poured a big head. Aroma reminds me of other belgian brews. Delicious brew. Smoother finish than I thought.
"
1," we sampled from 2 bottles which were substantially different from each other. Overall, poured with a large, tan, thick, foamy, frothy head and loads of lace. Color is an opaque black brown. Flavor falls down some, tart on top with some toasty malt, dark ripe fruit, yeast, molasses. Body has some high points that dont fit, carbonation is ok. Finish is like flavor, on the short side, no hint at all of alcohol.
"
1," I had a 33cl bottle which poured perfectly into the goblet.  Nice had and copper color.  Aroma became more apparent to me when I got halfway through the beer.  Taste has a hint of wood, malt gave me a crisp impression at first.  A fine Belgian Ale.
"
1," Dark hazy brown, roasted malts, dark fruits, floral, yesty, little spice, a bit sour, slight hop.
"
1," Chimay Cinq Cents is a very carbonated golden ale with particles swirling around in it.  The head is huge and foamy.  The aroma is bready and grassy with banana and clove.  It is very smooth on the mouth with a medium-full body.  It has a well-blended flavor, a touch sweet with banana bread, cloves and leather.  An excellent tripel.
"
1," Has a brown color, with lights of metallic reflexes. The head is abundant, creamy and very permanent. The cord is slow and dense. The aroma is spectacular, The malt and yeast are mixed surprisingly well.	The flavor is strong, very good. There has a sweetness tinted with one bitter fort (too maybe). Also I perceive something piquant, as the pepper (but it is good). Everything combines very well, is an incredible end. It seemed that when one stops consuming, nothing will stay. The end is so clean, that is inevitable to return to drink another little. Thank you Christian for sharing this great bottle.
"
1," I was disappointed by this one.  I dont think it lives up to the hype.  It was good, but Ive enjoyed other beligans much better.
"
1," Very wheaty, yeasty aroma. Appearance is an attractive light orange. When care is taken to ensure all of the bottles yeast has been poured into the glass, the hue becomes a dark orange. Rocky, marshmallow head. Flavor is sour and wheaty. Of all the hefe weizens I had while in Germany, this was toward the bottom of the list.
"
1," SEP 2, 2007 Mmmmmmmm. Bottle from Majestic gift pack. Beautiful pour. Amazing chocolate colour with soft creamy head. Complex aroma with a taste to match. Caramel, spice, raisins, plums... Strongish alcohol finish. What can be said really?	Standard great beer.

1," OCT 10, 2006 The aroma is wonderfully balanced between supple and light.  The appearance is a warm dark brown color with much lacing and a great honeycombed head.   The beer provides a good contrast of heavy malt, chocolate, and sweetness, with light woody characters.  The carbonation provides a wonderful dance on the palate with warm full bubbles exploding on your taste buds.  This beer is always a treat to drink and even more enjoyable when drank from larger bottles.
"
1," This is the Grande Reserve (the 750 ml bottle with champagne top).	Mahogany color, not too foamy, cloudy, lively carbonation. Yeast, cedar woodiness, smokiness, peppery spice, subtle green apple and a little port. A true experience although I preferred Orval.
"
1," Une excellente bire forte  boire tranquillement.  Armes dpices et de malt caramel, ronde en bouche, qui a une finale un peu abrupte (plus que la rochefort 8) et qui mindique quelle a un potentiel de viellissement....quelle va se complexifier avec le temps sans madriser.  A conserver ou  boire...achetez-en deux;-)
"
1," on tap-pours a light tan head and dark copper/red color.  Aroma is roasty, medium/dark malt-chocolate/cocoa powder, peat, faint citrus hops.  Taste follows.  Smooth.  Soft carbonation.
"
1," An excellent stout.  Full balanced flavor, a touch of sweetness, extremely smooth.
"
1," Cloudy mahogany-brown, with a strong finger or two of densely woven, Belgian tan head.		Malts, especially dark fruity ones- plums, currants, dried berries- stand out here. Not extremely yeasty but just enough to provide a light tang to the aroma. A light spiciness- cloves, very light black pepper- is also here.		Quite sweet, much like the aroma; I detect a lot of the same dark fruits, alongside brown and candy sugar flavors. Hints of chocolate, bread, and the aforementioned (still minor) yeast make this one complex and enjoyable. With warmth, the dark fruits take on a grapy/raisiny/winy flavor.		Medium/full-bodied with moderate carbonation (a little less than I expected from a Belgian). Somewhat smooth, with a light warming effect from the alcohol.		Not hard to have multiple glasses of this; this may not have been my favorite Belgian strong dark ale, but a good, enjoyable beer nonetheless
"
1," I liked it, but it did not blow my socks off.  It was a bit hoppy, which was much nicer than most of the ambers out there.  I enjoyed the balance in the beer.  If you are an amber fan, this is definitely one of the better ones out there.
"
1," If happiness was a beverage, this would definately be what it tasted like.  As the bottle describes, ""inky black,"" I couldnd describe it better myself.  Mild tan cream head and heavy coffee aroma leave me wishing I had this as an airfreshner.  Black Majic is smooth, like Guinness, but better.  Finish is nutty and roasty and delicious.  Coffee and beer... best of both worlds.   I have yet to find a better beer in a bottle.  Its only competition is Surly Coffee Bender, which sadly isnt available for purchase.  Black Majic Java Stout... near perfection.
"
1," 12 oz bottle.  Pours black with a tan head.  Aroma is big with creamy coffee, bourbon, and chocolate, oak, raisin.  Flavor is unfortunately on the thinner side, with the oak being the primary flavor followed by roasted coffee with some bourbon and cocoa.  I love the aroma, it could seriously be that of a top bourbon-aged imperial stout, but the flavor doesnt really follow through.
"
1," Bottle 330ml. Pours a dark brown with red hue and big beige head. Aroma is yeasty, raisings, figs, bit of molasses. Taste is medium sweet, light bitter. Medium body, oily/creamy, soft carbonation. I used to love this stuff, but I havent had one for a good while and was quite disappointed. 10042011
"
1," Has a nice ruddy brown color to it. Fruity and yeasty aroma. Flavor starts of with malt sweetness and assorted fruity qualities. Has some dryness to it to balance things out. It may be the most mainstream Trappist beer, but it still tastes good and is easily drinkable.
"
1," Bottle via trade. I think it was drfabulous. Heavy reddish appearance with a bubbly tan head. Aroma is a mix of roasted caramel and musty notes. Flavor is also a musty dry with a watery finish. Ashy flavor with a roasted dry finish.
"
1," Draught at the brewpub.  Cloudy greenish-yellow.  Celery aroma with a little funky tartness.  Tart, maybe with a hint of sweetness.  Celery and light citrus taste, along with lots of wheat.  An assertive, slightly strong and very wheaty interpretation.
"
1," On tap Rock Bottom Charlotte.  Deep brown pour with decent cream head and lace.  Aroma and flavor of floral hops, bit sweet.  Nothing to sit and dwell over.
"
1," Excellent, potent flavor, very malty with spicy flavor.  Good head, well carbonated, strong alcohol taste.  The 750ml bottle looks great and has a wonderful brew inside.
"
1," Single White Friar 08 @Tampa Weekly Gathering-Thanks gillard-12oz bottlepours a tan head and hazy dark copper color.  Aroma is dark fruit-plum/raisin.  Taste is dark fruit/chocolate-medium/dark malt, dark fruit-plum/raisin, and secondary earthy hops.
"
1," 11.2 ounce bottle-  poured out red-gold and cloudy with a firm off-white head.  Aroma wasnt much of anything except yeast.  There was a good 1/4 inch of sediment in the bottle.  Rolled it twice then poured.  Taste wasnt very exciting, maybe some light fruitiness and yeast, pleasant bitter finish.  Not bad, but for the price I will stick with the Chimay Blue.

1," AUG 31, 2007 VaBF 2007. Initially rated as their SDE dunkel, but I suspected I was wrong and have now confirmed that.		Draft"
1," Light brown in color.  Sediment on bottom that I was carful not to pour.  Nice and refreshing aroma of peaches.  Caramel in the body and alcohol.  Nice.
"
1," Bottled. An unclear yellow with a lazing beige head. The aroma has strong notes of wheat and banana. The flavor is sweet with notes of wheat and straw, leading to a dry wheaty finish. The body is light.
"
1," My husbands favorite.  Dark and rich.  Again Im learning just because its a dark beer doesnt mean bitter.  Very smooth.  Filling the growler is always a plus.

1," Bottle 33cl. Nice and decent Zwickel, quaffable and fresh. Very good foam!
"
1," OCT 10, 2008 Pours nice deep brown, good creamy head.		Taste is malty, fruity and has a viscous mouthfeel, very little hint of alcohol. Nice beer.
"
1," Pours inky black with a very quickly receding mocha head. Aroma of cold coffee, black strap molasses, roast bitterness, and wood. Taste of cold, french press coffee, strong roast, earthy oak flavors. Mouthfeel is full bodied with soft carbonation.
"
1," Do love a good coffe stout and this wasnt bad.  Poured a deep chestnut brown with a creamy mocha head.  The aroma was undeniably coffee with some roasted barley and a touch of bittersweet chocolate.  A bit thinner than I like my stouts but somewhat creamy.  The flavor was like a mocha java made with extra shots of espresso.  Pretty good stuff.
"
1,"	Piney, resinous hops merge with fruit jam maltiness to create floral, rosewater allusions in this healthy and drinkable Double IPA.		Further Personal Perceptions"
1," Its still daylight outside and Im still inside.  Pours from 33cl bottle into Chimay tulip glass with very thin head; galaxies of small bubbles, really.  A little darker than grandmas apple cider.  Waxy and fizzy.  Fine.
"
1," (Bottle 50 cl) Fully golden with a decent, white head. Very soft mouthfeel and a lightly sweetish malt. No bitterness. 170705
"
1," Bottle.  Deep ruby color with off white, foamy head.  Aroma is dark fruit, slightly alcoholic, and sweet.  Taste is bready, sweet, dark fruit, and vanilla.  Overall a really good brew.

1," MAR 24, 2007 Courtesy of omhper and drank as a horizontal alongside Jackelsdricka for comparison.  Pours mahogany and more or less still with no bubbles and only a hint of tingliness on the tongue.  Smells strongly of juniper with hints of spruce, birch and mineral water.  Taste is like a gin might be if it were a fermented beverage with loads of juniper and lots of booziness.  Some hints of smoke are also present.  Palate is very thick and reminds me of the heavy mineral waters of Europe.  Finishes along the lines of sassafras.  Very different from everything else I tried during this tasting that included sahtis, and lots of traditional Scandanavian beers.  If sahti and lambic are the grandparents of beer, this is their great grand parent.  Thanks again for this rare treat!

1," Bottle. Poured a small sized tan head with fine-medium sized bubbles that were mostly lasting. Uncarbonated, opaque and a dark brown hue. Malty, burnt, roasted and coffee nose. Coffee, roasted and burnt flavor from start to finish. Smooth palate. Fair lacing.
"
1," 12oz bottle - 		Aroma - very hard to pick-up any major aromas.  Light malty grain, a little sulfur and a touch of apple juice.		Appearance - solid gold body, clear with sporadic bubbles coming up from the bottle.  Head starts out about 3/4"" thick, disipates to just a splatch of nothing really.		Taste - flavor is really clean, not much to hang your hat on.  Kinda minerally tasting, light grass and a touch of sweet malt		Palate - light bodied, light carbonation...has a seltzer water kinda feel to it		Overall - a really nice standard lager.  Not sure where the ""pre-prohibition"" claim/name comes in to play.  No noticeable flaws, easy to drink.  Big thanks to pfoxyjohn for sending me this one!
"
1," Appearance is a hazy amber color with a white head.  Aroma is slightly fruity with heavy alcohol overtones.  Well the alcohol aroma is overwhelming in the taste as that is all I can taste.  Some slight fruit but mainly alcohol and at 6% that is unexpected and disappointing making me extremely reluctant to try their stronger beers.  Finishes dry which is to be expected.  There are much better examples for half the price.
"
1," 750 ml bottle. opaque red brown.  caramel aroma.  tight, sharp carobation that spread over tongue.  fantastic palate - similar in some respects to the celebrator.  smooth, well balanced caramel.  not burnt or bitter as most come.  theres a slight metallic aftertaste that fits with the flavor.  not at all unpleasant.  the flavor drops off quickly with a crisp finish that begs you to indulge in more.  i could down several bottles if it wasnt so  damn expensive.  those monks know what they are doing.
"
1," The new batch I tried was more fresh, somewhat sparkling from the still ongoing fermentation in the bottle, and beautifully hazy. There are definitely some smokey juniper flavour. The main characteristics of the beer seem intact from the last batch I tried though.	Older comments"
1," This brew pours a rich amber color with a medium thick off-white head. Thin and sticky lacing. The aroma consists of hops and citrus. Medium-bodied and nicely hopped, with some fruit and malt present in the flavor as well. The finish is crisp and dry. Overall this is pretty decent, if a little bland.
"
1," Thin ever present head. Aroma of leather and straw. Smooth palate with a medium to full body. The mouthfeel is perhaps my favorite aspect of this one. Flavor of leather and straw. The finish is the only place where I taste any spicyness. Good but not my favorite of the style.
"
1," Pours a nice hazy reddish almost copper color with a big tan head that leaves plenty of lace. 	The aroma is lightly nutty and floral with plenty of apple, caramel, and dark fruit (raisin/plum/fig). The beer seemed a bit boring smelling at first whiff but I am loving this more and more each time I raise the glass to my nose. 	The flavor is at first almost like a candied sweetness, but this is fleeting and the beer presents its self with a much drier spicier flavor. This beer has the fruitiness the caramel and the nuttiness that you would come to expect from a good dubbel. However it possesses a quality that continuously mystifies me, there is a defined mineral character to this beer. The earthy Mineral like character was one of the first real flavors that I identified in a beer years ago and its been a real love hate thing ever since, but the mineral qualities in this beer only add to the depth and complexity of this ale and I dare say this for me sets this beer apart from many in its style. There are also those plum raisin and fig characteristics in the flavor that showed up in the aroma. This is a very silky well rounded and perfectly balanced beer, not one bit of the alcohol is really noticeable here. This beer is better than I remember it being.
"
1," Dark red pour with a tan head. Faint aroma of roasted malts and some fruit. Flavor of caramel and dark fruits. Light to medium body.
"
1," The body was black with a light tan colored head. The aroma was pancakes with vanilla and maple. Very sweet smelling. The taste was milk chocolate with a creamy mouthfeel. The was a dry woody finish with a littel wood.
"
1," Not as spicy and complex as its cousin the Grand reserve, this is still a wonderful Trappist Ale that gives a mix of cinnamon and vinilla with a complex malty flavor
"
1," Pours a hazy rusty reddish brown. A thin white head goes away pretty quickly to form a ring around the glass.		The smell is very sugary and heavy on malt. Dried dark fruits come to mind, prunes, raisins, there is some apple juice and grape juice. Lots of yeast and almost no alcohol smell.		Initially this beer is pretty sugary and sweet with a faint sourness on the sides of the mouth. The hops are spicey and add to the bitterness. The finish is sweet and spicey with a lot of fruityness. 		Medium bodied with a crisp carbonation. Good drinkability.
"
1," Reddish brown beer with a decent tan head. Nothing really jumps out in the nose.As it warms up the flavors definately develop until at room temperature(on a SoCal summer day) this has got a great flavor.Not complex or anything just a nice beer.
"
1," Bottled, 500ml from York Beer & Wine. Clouded orange amber with virtually no head. Vinegar snatch on the nose leading to an infected sour cream, chalky off flavour. Its a gonner unfortunately. Poor show.
"
1,"  This one pours a cloudy, weak straw yellow  color.  There wasnt much head on it.  The aroma has a whiff of clove and banana.  There was much less evidence of them in the taste.  Somewhat wheaty taste, but a thinner body and a bit weak.  My wife likes it.
"
1," 2010 Bottle - Pours a clear coppery amber with a large beige head...aroma is bright, tons of caramel and citrus, pithy and malty...flavour is almost as good, decently bitter, dry malt and bread, grapefruit peel and resin...definitely a nice rendition of a west coast IPA...
"
1," Bottle, 5% bought at the brewery. Mildly farty aroma. Clear dark brown colour. Small stable tan head. The flavour is nicely roasted, slightly sweet. Good and nutty. A bit on the sweet side, but nice enough. Spicy hop flavour in the aftertaste.
"
1," Ive had many a Chimay (and love them) before, but I just picked up a 3 pack to rate today, so il start with the first.  Pours a cloudy peach color with a creamy white head.  Aroma is a bit faint, but I smell a little spice and bananas.  Flavor is the same, good overall.
"
1," this was good.  nice hoppy sweet flavor that didnt have too many characteristics of a strong 9% beer.  had a nice sweet smell to it.  poured dark brown with a massive tan colored head.  this was better than rochefort 8, however i think rochefort 8 may be an acquired taste- something that i am not up to as far as belgian strongs go yet.  this is a great beer though.

1," Pours a light brown with a half inch thick head.  Aroma is mostly of yeast and malt with some banana and cherry.  Taste is of fruit and nut with yeast and  light malt.  Finish is nice, but a little hot.
"
1," Draught.  Pours nut brown, caramel with orange hints and a small frothy light tan head that leaves some lined spotty lacing.  Smoky toasted oat malt, kind of ashy, with some fruit hop notes (berries).  Smoky burnt ash starts to hide the  toasted oat but the smokiness comes through with a hint of bacon and a moderately acidic hop character.  It seems watery.  Medium bodied and crisp, clean palate.  A very noble attempt by the brewer but I think the ash flavor kills it; still an interesting attempt.
"
1," bottle courtesy of tyler, thanks homie! definitely an interesting drink. theres the impoerter base, but then theres a complex layered taste and mouthfeel. lots of sweetness, lots of bitterness almost keeps up. it is helped out by the wine like tannic part of the profile, which extends to a figish, almost prune like aspect from the rasin juice and very dark sugars. the spices shine a tad here and there but are not overwhelming in any way. the cardamon can be found at most times if you look. i like the progression on the palate and tongue in this one. its just a tiny bit tart, but the sweetness eventually wins over the finish, making it lightly refreshing and not too too heavy. definitely a nice offering. wouldnt mind aging a couple of these to see how they develop over a year or so.
"
1," Nice aroma full of summer with smells of hops and light yeast.  Taste is well satisfying not ovelry bitter, but decent through the swallow.  A decent keller beer.
"
1," Poured from a big bottle. Sort of fizzy head and that faded quickly. The flavor is in the fig  and prune genre, but not that great. Interesting to try but doubtful I would buy it again.
"
1," Huge aroma of dark fruity as soon as I pour.  Nice reddish hue with lively white head.  Not long lasting and mo real lacing.  A touch of sour on the nose as I embelish a little more.  Flavor is definitley fruity esters and a cherry finish.  Some note of belgian yeastiness.  Lots of bubbles throughout, I can reinvigorate head with little movement.  Nice easy finish.  Not chewy at all, a little lighter in body than I was anticipating.  But all goes nicely together.
"
1," light hoppy aroma,amber, hazy, off white foam, light sweetness, lightly bitter, light body, oily feel, fizzy, bitter finish.
"
1," bottle...pours a mahogany color (which actually surprised me) with a grandiose tan head.  Banana and clove nose.  Wonderful palate, banana flavors abound.  A little hop presence in the middle, great finish.  It is hard to top the last 3 beers I have drinken (Chimay Bleu, Kulmbacher Eisbock and De Dolle Stille Nacht).  A superior ending to a great day.

1," (bottle) Clear, golden colour with a medium-sized foamy white head. Quite hoppy and herbal nose with a light-sweet strawy malty background. Light-bitter flavour, medium to light bodied with a slightly crispy carbonation. Pale malt-character, subtle fruity taste; sweet-bitter finish with a slightly herbal hops character. Not bad but also a bit one-dimensional.

1," Smooth and creamie with a long lasting head.  Oddly enough i can get this at a local grocery for around $10 a bottle

1," bottle, pours deep hazy mahogany, tall off white head.  Strawberry, orange, and yeasty aroma.  Moderate carbonation, kicks in after the initial sweet malt and fruit flavors and ends mellowed with a faint amount of spice.  Very drinkable and easy to love.

1," Pours cloudy rich brown with a medium beige head, good lacing.  Smells of apple, banana, pear, bread and hay.  Medium-thick, velvety body.  Tastes of tart apple, caramel, banana, with some hay aftertaste.  Somewhat sour, but balanced.  Very nice brew.
"
1," Totally opaque pour with a massive, long lasting tan head - aroma of bourbon, vanilla, oak, alcohol - a bit thin on the palate - not many oatmeal stout characteristics besides a hint of lactose - mostly, the wood and bourbon from the barrel overpower whatever other flavors the beer has - if you want a similar experience, soak a tongue depressor in whiskey and suck on it.

"
1," 750ml bottle from By the Bottle in Vancouver, WA--Poured a rich, ruby-chestnut body with a full beige head.  Yeastiness, hoppiness, and sweet maltiness prevailed on this beer.  Lots of aroma and fruity complexities.  Effervescent mouthfeel, but not over the top. Gritty, full-bodied texture.  Great hoppy profile.  Spicy yet easy on the palate.  I could drink this all day.
"
1," Bottle at the Williamsburg Gathering courtesy of jcwattsrugger. Lightened black pour. Almost almost more a dark brown. Nose is soft coffee-ish notes, mild chocolate, light cocoa, toasted malts, soft grain and yeast. Taste echoes the coffee-ish notes, cocoa, yeast notes, grains, odd spice/herbs and toasted malts. Body is light-medium. Mild carbonation. Ends with more cocoa, softer chocolate, spices/herbs, light yeast, toasted malts. Tasty!

1," 12 oz bottle		A generous bonus from a friendly trader I drank this on a quiet evening when there wasnt time for a heavier beer or something in a larger format. A bit more than your basic lawnmower beer this is an assertive IPA. Its not quite up there with the best of the best but I can imagine regionally that it is one of the better choices.		Aroma / Appearance - Coppery brown with a dirty white head the body was what youd imagine a solid IPA to be. Aged cedar planks stand out in a mixture of hops and malt that is not quite the strongest West Coast but certainly in the ballpark. Actually it comes across as a bit tame.		Flavor / Palate - Heavy malt alerts the palate that this is not your average pale ale. Tasting like someone watered down planks of maple it transitions in the end to a resiny pine cone. The mouthfeel is thick enough to almost be cloying for the style but stops just short of the line. This was solid but doesnt make me want to put much effort into stocking up on more Nebraska pale ales.
"
1," Enjoyed at the brewery from the beer engine.  A clear copper color with a thick foamy head.  Very light aroma that is indeed toasted and a bit nutty, much like an English bitter.  Creamy, toasted, earthy flavor with sweet and metallic notes.  Creamy medium mouth feel that is fairly wet.  This is very much English styled pale ale.
"
1," A hazy brown weizen with a thick lacing light moka head. Aroma of flambed bananas and caramel. In mouth, caramel and bananas, cloves, maple syrup in finale. Medium bodied. On tap at brewpub Dec. 30 2008.

"
1," 330ml bottle.  Pours a dark cloudy reddish brown with a creamy head.  Aroma is dark fruit, yeast, and some alcohol.  Flavor is sweet malt, dark fruit, yeast, some spice, and a little bite of alcohol.  A fairly astringent dry finish.  A very interesting beer, though I think itd benefit from a few years in the cellar.
"
1," Pours a deep amber color, with a frothy head that quickly diminished to a very thin one, that lasts throughout, with no lace. Nose of yeast, vanilla, plum and other dark fruits. Taste is sweet, a little spicy, and hints of booze. Leaves a very mild warming feel in the stomach. Overall, decent, but I left feeling that there must be better brews of this style.
"
1," Bottle. Pours rich Mahogany with white head that slowly disperses. Malt aroma with fruit over tones. Nice spicy flavor with medium body.
"
1," Bottle. Murky orange with an uncontrollable, spiralling carbonation feeding a tall uneven head. Completely schizophrenic aroma veering from deeply unpleasant rusty tin can notes (at first)  to marmalade, bath foam, pineapple and acetone in one sniff. Hints of cake and sulphur. Red apple peel in tupperware/apple strudel taste like White Shield. Earthy malts, spicy yeast. Bay leaf custard piped with TCP and heartburn. Isnt that one of Hestons? IPA like it (probably) used to be; eye-watering, nose-wrinkling, hairs-on-chest stuff.
"
1," Last night was the first time I tried Chimays Grande Rserve, what can be said about such an elegant beer, the first thing you notice is the wonderful aroma, then the Dark redish/brown to almost black colour,  I was really impressed with this beer, the flavor is just wonderful so bold and sweet, no after taste, and we got the chance to use are trappist glasses.  All in all this truly is Chimays Grande Rserve
"
1," (12oz bottle, thanks CaptainCougar) Small off-white head atop clear copper body.  Aroma is moderately sweet, molasses, caramel, light alcohol.  Taste is sweet, molasses, caramel, some alcohol, light candi sugar.  Sticky full body.
"
1," 2009-01-21. Served in snifter.		330 ml bottle with freshness date (Best before end of 2012) and recommended serving temperature, glassware and cellaring procedure on the label.		Dark copper color with a 2,5 cm brown-shaded and sparkling head that dissipates rather fast and leaves some small lacings.		A general sweet and fruity smell (kind of like ripe apricots), soft chocolate nougat and notes or grass sits firmly on a backbone of yeast and spices.		At first, sweet malts, fruits and bread hits the taste buds. Then, a mild yeast note and a distinct spicy flavor - primarily cloves - takes over for a while before the finish. Its just slightly vinous. The finish is characterized by a gentle bitterness, even more gentle tartness and spices. Towards the end, it develops a nice caramel flavor.		Medium body, nice and lively carbonation. Very nice mouthfeel.		A very well-composed beer with interesting, pleasant and sometimes subtle notes to be discovered.		Serving type"
1," Looks, a bit like root beer. malty nose with light chocolate hints. The taste is interesting. Starts like a watery ale, quickly rushing through mint, then malty chocolate then back to mint finiching with a crisp, mildly wheaty palate. Not sure if i would fight anyone for this beer, but its not a bad idea.
"
1," Bottle. Prunish brown pour with buff off-white head. Dark fruit, light berry, candied sugar all around. Flavor of raisin, fig, brown sugar, sugar cookie and some grape. mostly like the other two, and seriously nothing special.
"
1," DEC 30, 2008 Bottle"
1," Bottle at Papss - Thanks BelJohansen. Clear reddish - white head. Coffee, chocolate, sweetness, berries, dried fruits, honey, licorice, soapy, alcoholic, overripe fruits. OK.
"
1," Aroma of malt, flowers, and herbs.  Brown, large white head.  Flavor is complex.  Some bitterness.  Malt, and fruit that seems to hold back.  Heavy palate.
"
1," (Bottle 50 cl) Courtesy of MiP. Clear golden with a white head. Clean and malty aroma. Medium-bodied with sweet malts and a lightly spicy touch. The finish is dry. 041008
"
1," Pours an opaque dark brown color, aroma of bread, not much else there.  There is a sweet cough drop taste with hints of bubble gum and mint.  The alcohol is very apparent in this one.  Medium to heavy bodied, very sticky, with average cabonation.  Finish is a sweet, almost sour taste.
"
1," Draft. Light gold colorwith a medium white head. Sweet malt aroma. Bland, generic flavor, slightly bitter finish. Bleah... not too great. C
"
1," On tap at the brewery in Nashville. Light amber color. Little aroma - some maltiness. Taste is surprisingly hoppy and out of style. Some Pils/Munich and Banana esters. Odd and interesting interplay of flavors, but not to style.
"
1, Pours an opaque dark brown. Has a 2 finger foamy tan head which dissipates fairly quickly. A little bit of sediment floating on top and throughout the beer. Minimal lacing.		Smell
1," Pretty baller. The belgians know their shit when it comes to beer. Very rich and flavorful beer. Doesnt taste alcoholic at all, but gets you drunk.
"
1," Orange color, clouded by many-a chunk of floating yeast.  Nose is juicy and fruity with citrus notes and some spice.  Roasted hop flavors are prevalent in the body with a little malt poking through.  Finishes long and with a touch of sweetness, although not much.  An ok ESB, but the hop flavors arent for me.
"
1," Dirty amber with frothy white head.  Aroma is somewhat fruity, malty, and yeasty with a strange muskiness(maybe I got an old bottle).	Mouthfeel is soft and creamy? with medium carbonation.  Flavor is sweet malt and candi with a tinge of spice in the finish.  Do Monks really make this?
"
1," APR 2, 2006 100% blind rating.		Head is initially large, frothy, off-white, mostly lasting.		Body is hazy dark amber, bottle conditioned.		Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain), lightly to moderately yeasty (mold, cobwebs), with notes of orange peel, cola, clove.		Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter.	Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter.		Light to medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation.		Bring the noise, doubters.  Had no idea this was being poured, and my rating went DOWN from when I rated it non-blind (3.0 at last rating).
"
1," ABR 2007.  Black body with faint head.  Coffee aroma and smooth body but a bit bitter on the finish.
"
1," This is one of those beers that just gets better the closer to the bottom of the glass you get. The spicy pepper sensation at the end blows me away every time. Heavy brown sugar flavor early on and the alcohol comes to the top a little but not in an obtrusive manner. Very very tasty.
"
1," Amber in colour with a nice sized off-white head.  Aroma is hoppy and lightly malty.  Flavour is nice and hoppy with a little earthiness to it.  Nice bitter end.
"
1," Jet black pour with a frothy tan head.  Lots of boozy bourbon and vanillan oak in the nose.  The body offers a more rounded chocolate and marshmellow notes.  The finish ends boozy as well.  This is a fresh batch to be released in bombers in November.  Il have to grab a fresh bottle to lay down for a while because this could really sing with some age on it.
"
1," Bottle. Beer of the month club. Clear golden with a white head. Aroma has some sour fruits, corny notes, some slightly citric hops notes and a decent malt character, a bit bready, with some graininess. Flavor has some sourness, light malty sweetness, citric notes and some mild bitterness. Light-medium-bodied. Sourness seems out of place, but its still a OK drinkable Lager.
"
1," 650ml bottle pours a golden color with some orange highlights.  There is about a finger of white head which leaves a few spots of lace.  Aroma is light citrus.  Taste is light malty sweetness with a moderate citrusy hop bitterness in the finish.  A decent enough IPA which was quite enjoyable.
"
1," Big white head, great yesty aroma.  Big alcohol without the flavor of it.  When it warms up a bit, hops start to take control of the finish.
"
1," k, mine was skunked.  only a little, but seemed dusty and old, but some of the flavor made its way through, which was kind of yeasty with a little malt following.
"
1," Tap, EPCOT, 3/04.  Why do brewpubs insist on making light beers?  Unoffensive, very pale clear yellow.  No aroma...well, maybe soggy white bread.  Strong, raw barley flavor.  Wet.  Great lacing.  I've certainly had worse, no flavor is better than bad flavor.
"
1,"  its lightly fruity, theres a bit of roastiness, and it is also a bit spicey (clove or coriander or both).  Easily the most complex of the three, and to me, the most likable.		Appearance is a nice red-brown, which is not quite opaque.  Head formation is decent, whitish, of uniformly sized bubbles, and sticks around an average amount of time.  Aroma is of dried fruit, and a bit of spice.  Flavor is more of the same, but adds a layer of light roastiness.  The fruitiness exists in a dried fruit sense, but also exerts itself as lightly sour (like sour cherries).  Mouthfeel was a bit astringent and drying, which youd expect from a beer with roasty and sour characteristics.  I really liked this beer.		Ive had this in restaurants before (all the Chimays seem like theyre popping in fine-dining places everywhere), and it is usually served much too cold.  This beer really seems to shine at about 50-55 degrees.		Definitely recommended.
"
1," Aroma was a bit vegetable, almost soapy. Nice lacing, but murky pour. Not unattractive however. Nice bronze color. Flavor was a bit metallic and soapy. Perhaps medicinal. Decent beer, but I would not go out of my way to purchase it.
"
1," Sampled at Dickinsonbeers NJ January gathering.  what an ugly-ass label!!  and not in a good way.  dark brown semi-opaque color, light tan thick foamy head.  aroma is acrid and metallic.  some chocolate malt underneath.  flavor is diactyl, tangy, butterscotch sweet malt.  tangy off-metallic aftertaste.  train wreck.
"
1," Chimay has a very thin body. It pours cloudy red and has a good but not too strong taste.
"
1," On tap at the brewpub. Hazy amber with a nice rocky white head. Nice spiderweb white lace. Nose is bannanna and clove. An odd sweetness, like powdered sugar, is detectable. Finish is similar to the taste. Light and refreshing hefe.
"
1," Nice ceiling popper. Deep orange brown with a light tan head. Fruity metallic nose. Smooth malt flavor with citrus and fruity notes throughout. Very drinkable and well balanced.
"
1," The bottle looks really good, as well as the beer in the glass. Zippy, nice head. Starts modest dry, good use of hops, well balanced. A little bit sourish-soapy. Finish more spicy with a fine malty background. For a festbier it could be a little bit more spicy, but still a really good beer!
"
1," My least favorite of the Chimay three -- lots of alcohol, and a rather thin maltiness.  It's fine, but much inferior to the white.
"
1," Beautiful murky brown colour with a wonderful head.  Perfect blend of malt and hops, not to bitter and not overly sweet with a nice hint of caramel.  Cant taste the alcohol on finish.
"
1," Aroma is a sweet caramel malt. Taste has a strong sweetness with hints of caramel chocolate. Overall pretty good, but not extraordinary.
"
1," I know I have to put a certain amount to words down, but I can sum up this beer in two words....MIND BLOWER!  If you love Belgian strong ale, BUY IT and savour it!
"
1," Brown chestnut like color with a large foamy brown head. Smells a bit of dates, brown sugar and yeast. Taste is pretty yeasty. Alcohol is pretty well hidden. Has some of that brown sugar and a little roastyness.
"
1," Bottle from some club in Chicago. Pours hazy dark brown with small tan head. Aromas of raisins, dark caramel, brown sugar, and yeast. Flavors of belgain yeast, caramel, dark fruits, and dark bready malts. Nice body and carbonation.
"
1," Bottle from a sample pack. Smooth drinking. Sweet with a lot of different fruit tastes mixed together. Light alcohol at the end.
"
1," rather new to belgium styles... not a bad beer but definitely something i would buy too much of
"
1," 750ml bottle. Pours a brickish colour with almost no head and no lace. Smells of caramel, brown sugar and grain. Tastes of the same. A little too sweet for my taste.
"
1," On tap at Alt Platz. Color was a dark brown with a small tan head. Aroma was malty with floral hops and a bit nutty. Flavor was a nutty chocolate with a nice hop bitterness in the finish.  Keep up the good work Tom.
"
1," SEP 22, 2004 A wonderful beer, very fine selection. Very smooth flavor that gets better throughout. Very remarkable flavor and balance. Near perfect!!
"
1," on tap-pours a light tan head that laces and amber color.  Aroma is northwest hops-grapefruit.  Taste is sweet northwest hops-grapefruit/slight bitter, some medium malt.  	*@Indiana Beerfest-on cask-pours a white ring for a head and hazy gold color.  Aroma is pine-hops (Chinook?), some medium malt.  Taste is resin/pine-hops (Chinook?), some medium malt.  Minimum carbonation.
"
1," I really enjoyed this beer, especially the aroma and color. I enjoyed the initial taste, however the after taste was a bit strong for me.
"
1," Golden-brown colour.  The aroma is heavy on the molasses and alcohol.  Sweet, figgy taste with hints of piloncillo and tobacco.  Chocolate and overripe pear in the finish.  Not bad.
"
1," The best of  starters of the Trappist.    Available across the US, good flavor, aroma and appearance, you cant go wrong with this one!
"
1," Draft sample at Keg Fest of Ale.		Poured clear dark brown color with an average frothy off-white head that mostly lasted with excellent lacing. Moderate toasted chocolate malt aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture and flat carbonation. Medium to heavy sweet toasted flavor with a medium to heavy sweet finish of moderate duration.		Drinkable brew that met my expectations.
"
1," (bottle) Hazy golden/orange colour with a big and stable white foamy head. Yeasty, peach-fruity, slightly floral aroma. Rounded wheat maltiness and fruitiness combined in a fine and complex way with aspects of cloves and floral notes.
"
1," Very interesting. This beer makes any beer drinkers perfect stand-in for any decent white wine. An opaque amber off the pour with one-half to an inch of pale tan head, the aroma is definitely beerish, with yeast being the most apparent, followed by hops. However, the taste is of citrus, summer berries, and plum with smooth malt undertones, followed by a fairly strong, wine-like alcoholic kick.
"
1," On tap with Immy at brewpub. Dark gold, golden ale, foamy white head. Fruity aroma of apple and pear with slight notes of bread. Flavor much the same, sweet malty fresh fruit, medium to heavy body. Very easy drinking.
"
1," Bottle.  A hazy yellow coloured hefeweizen with a nice big white head.  The aroma is yeasty and wheaty and there is a lot of banana going on.  The taste is more of the same and the body seems fuller than the majority in the style.  For me a really nice example of a style I not struck on.
"
1," Well I was really excited to try this Valentines Day treat they brewed up for the holiday. I was a little dissapointed though. Poured into a standard pint glass with a HUGE head, little lacing though. Dark ruby tint with a little black look to it. Smell was almost non existant. Very faint fruit smell with some sugar. Taste was just ok. Very light roasted character to it, some malts, a charred taste to it, and very very faint cherry or maybe even raisin character in the end. Mouthfeel was too thin, very watery, which Ive come to expect of most of their beers. Almost like a light macro. Drinkability was alright, nothing special here. I expected quite a bit more, but I am glad to see a local brewery branching out and doing something different.
"
1," Bottle shared with Hogtown Harry and Blankboy, Harrys bottle.  Odd aroma - some alcohol, some hops, but I dont know - weird.    Dark orange, small white head.  Odd taste - burnt malt, some hops, sweetened tea.  Man, I did not like this one at all. Maybe it was off, but the bottle was fresh enough from one of Harrys recent trades I think.
"
1," This IPA pours an orange gold color from a 12oz bottle. Small to medium sized white foamy head. Aroma is floral and herbal hops, touch of toffee and sweetness. A medium bodied IPA. Malts are caramel and sweet. Hops are herbal, grapefruity and citrusy, touch of pepper. There is a lots of bitterness to this IPA, but its not that harsh. Summit hops alpha acids at work here? Nicely balance. Good carbonation. A very drinkable IPA. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is bitter.
"
1," I read through some other reviews after I wrote this one. Many said the bourbon was way too strong. I sat on this bottle for probably 4-5 months.		3/3/07
"
1," Dark reddish colour with small head.Aroma is malty and with note of apricot and plum.Flavor is fruity and with full body,is well balanced and nice,still the blue is better.
"
1," No aroma. I had a somewhat stuffy nose that evening and I could smell nothing all night. I figured it was the beer, but where there were hops, I could smell them. Deep mahogany in color. Very little head or lace. Nice roasted malt. A quality brew. These guys know what they are doing. Too thin to be more highly rated. Still, no flaws.
"
1," From the Jug at the GABF, Colorado Convention Center 12/10/2007	Fruity aroma. Small tan head. Black strong in alcohol and fruity with some dryness in a crisp and bitter full roast finish.
"
1," Pop top bottle.  Fairly strong aroma, bready malt and belgian yeast as expected, some alcohol, raisins/grapes,  with a minor light citrus fruit.  Very murky, grey sediment mixed in with the grayish-light brown color, pour had decent pillowy head, dissipated eventually, little lacing that doesnt stick.   Similar to the chimay red with that slight roasty bite to it that lingers into the finish in the back of the throat, very evident yeast flavor with darker sweet dough malt, also almost like a dark berry fruit, little bitter fades into the aftertaste quickly.  Love the complexity, the better the less cold it got, if not for the finish would be even more outstanding.
"
1," The strongest and fruitiest of the three Red, Blue, and White beers of Chimay. You cant go wrong with this beer. Serve it with dinner or by itself.
"
1," Bottle. Black brown, fluffy head. Chocolate, caramel, sweet nutty aroma. Coffee, chocolate, and slight woody bourbon flavor. A nice porter.
"
1," Nice and spicy.  A great blond ale.  Wish I could get some here.  Well carbonated.
"
1," Bottle Conditioned, 330 ml, Aged 5.5yrs. Tawny with light head.Saved this rating for an aged beer and boy did I enjoy it. The smoothness was supreme with a thick mouthfeel and a juicy fruitiness. Enjoyed this while watching England in the World cup and although it was a nervy second half against Paraguay with a dodgy Mexican Referee both the beer and team were winners. I hope this doesnt re open the new vs old Chimay arguments, but this was a belter, just like Becks free kick.
"
1," Hazy red colour. Some malt in the aroma together with some candy sweetness. Quite a metallic taste with some bitter cocoa-like malt coming through in the aftertaste.
"
1," Its good, but not worth the price/hype IMO.  High in carbination and had a somewhat airy taste, which worked to mask the fruitiness.  It did get a more malty taste as it warmed, but not even comparable to the bread/yeast finishes of some other Belgians Ive tried.
"
1," 650mL bottle, pours hazy golden. Strong aroma of pungent citrus, resinous hops, floral notes and caramel. Flavour of toasted caramel and citrus hops - no where near as strong and decadent as the aroma. Nice for Dead Frog though.
"
1," Botella. Comprada en supermercado. Muy buena. Gran aroma. Amarga. A pesar de lo bueno de la cerveza, no me conquist.
"
1," This one surprised me.   It has enough hops to qualify as a pilsener.  My bottle was pretty skunked.  A big foamy head w/ active carbonation.  Taste is sweet w/ the ""eastern european flavor"". Finish is bitter, astrigent, with a chemical off-flavour.  A little watery.
"
1," Bottle. Nice big lasting tan head. Color is brown. Aroma is sweet and lots of spices. Taste is spices and sweetness as well. Good mouthfeel.
"
1," Malty, pithy aroma. Ligh sweet aroma with honey notes. Dark yellow, hazy color. Nice creamy head. Malty sweet, pithy with honey notes. Light dry and bitter end. A very well balanced, tastefull beer.
"
1," [Bottle] Nearly black, clear pour with a light brown head. Roasted malts, oatmeal, chocolate and coffee in the aroma. Similar roasted grain taste throughout. Distinct smoky notes add a pleasant dimension to this brew. Sweet chocolate and residual brown sugars keep this beer on the sweet side despite the smoke. Burnt bread and light vanilla hints in the finish. A nice body and pleasant finish. A good one.
"
1," Poured brown with a nice thick white head. Aroma very faint. Flavor was trashy sweet with a tang that didnt blend.
"
1," (Bottle) A very promising appearance and aroma. -It smells like a classic Belgian with all the right notes of malt, berries, coffee. Flavor is dry, quite full but unfortunately also  very metallic. Damn!
"
1," Tasty, a bit on the bitter hops side.  Direct to your tounge buds.  But not overly amazing.  A bit of apple... mahogany flavor, if mahogany was a flavor.  Its alright.
"
1,"   Bottle that Nick & Anna (next door neighbours) brought back for me from one of the regular excursions up to Harris, cheers Nick & Anna, consumed 30-12-09   Pours copper in colour with some red tinges. Taste is fruity with some hedgerow berries. Some bitterness shows its fine.  A6 A4 F7 P3 Ov13  3.3 
"
1," DEC 4, 2011 This is really a wonderful beer.  Rich mahogany color on pour.  Well-carbonated with plenty of head.  Nice irregular pattern of bubbles in the head.  Aroma smacks of caramel, yeast, cola, plum and apricot.  Well-balanced malt and hops.  Very, very complex character.  Fairly carbonated.  Overall a delightful beer, and one of my favorites from Belgium along with Rodenbach. A special beer.
"
1," Draught. Pours light copper with a faint white head. The aroma is sweet in a floral way with a very low acidity. The flavor is predominantly malty, though the brew is still thin overall. Hints of chocolate bread and nutmeg make up the light flavor and perhaps a small nip in the finish. Not so bad.
"
1," easy drinkin.  not the most exciting flow of flavors youl try.  more of a lunch lunch beer than a breakfast beer.  not many distinguished flavors to savor.  but quite smooth.
"
1," Bottle thanks to ronnie! Roasty, chocolate, caramel, very bready, notes of smoke, the hops are clearly there as its not too sweet, but i cant tell what they are giving, The chocolate and breadyness dominate and leave for a seriously long finish, like 2 mins long.
"
1," Nice attempt but I am way too picky on porters. Aroma was sweet and malty but not that roasty. Dark brown with no head. Very creamy body. Flavor was raosty, spicy and coffee tones
"
1," Bottle. Dark brown with small head. Malty caramel aromas. Some sweetness ending with a moderate dry-bitter finish. Expected more, maybe its too commercialized!
"
1," Beautiful muddy/brown appearance, with a frothy white head on top. Yeasty, fruity, malt aroma. Spices, and hard fruit. Rich, full flavors. Roasted malts, yeast, figs, and apples. Alcohol warmth felt by the end of the bottle. This is a very good belgian strong , but what else would you expect from Chimay?
"
1," A great beer.  Very, very smooth and mild.  It was pretty malty and had a nice nut flavor.  There was a slightly vanilla aftertaste that I found appealing.  Attractive, a dark brown with a fluffy, beige head.  There was a fruity flavor that was a little hard to put my finger on, but I liked it.
"
1," Cask @ National Winter Ales Festival 2009, Manchester. Pours a dark brown color with a small tan head. Has a roasted malty chocolate aroma with some fruity hints. Roasted malty chocolate flavor. Has a sweetish roasted malty chocolate finish with some hints of caramel in the aftertaste.
"
1," Tasty, well balanced ruby ale, very like an English strong ale to my tastebuds. Lighter body, fruity, quite refreshing. Dry malty finish. Drinkable.
"
1," Bottled.	Yellow coloured with a white head.	Aroma of vegetables with notes of grain and celery.	Flavour of grains and vegetables.
"
1," sample @ the pub, orange, nice carbonation the hop utilisation is well think-ed. Citrus note, a bit of caramel.
"
1," Dark amber/brown, fine head and lacing.  Dark fruits in the malt along with some subtle spice.  Palate was a bit overcarbonated and thinner than it looked.  It thickend a bit as it warmed, but not enough.  The most complex of the Chimays.
"
1," Just a great Belgian.  Brown pour with an off-white head.  Beautiful notes of dried fruit and sweet malt.  The same flavors dance across your palate.  A solid beer and a great starter for those that are ready to rise to the occasion and start drinking some more flavorful and refined beers.
"
1," 12oz bottle from Parti-Pak Liquors (Indianapolis, IN). Pours a hazy golden to caramel color with one finger white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is sweet and floral with notes of banana, clove, spice, bread, yeast, honey. Flavor is sweet and malty with notes of banana, clove, honey, spice, yeast, sweet citrus, light floral esters. Medium body with a sweet and floral finish.
"
1," MAR 15, 2009 This beer was good, but not 4.0 good. Aroma was fantastic with a strongly floral, almost candy-like character but admittedly I didnt know what to expect from the trappist style.  Flavor was solid, a heavy beer which I love with an almost flowery sweet/fruity flavor in there and finishes just a bit malty.
"
1," I had several incarnations of this beer. I have had it aged 13 years, fresh, and aged a couple of years.  I must say that the latter is the most enjoyable.  The flavor is yeasty and somewhat vinous, with a roasted malty candy flavor. Consistently good.
"
1," Small yellowish head over hazed, pale amber beer with a mossy sheen. Slight sourish nose, with (darker) malty notes, fresh smelling. Hints at sweeter background with juniper berry. Malty with faint liquorice, bit of aniseed retronasal. Dark(er) malts dominant. Prickly MF, lighter body than expected. Definitely different from the Chimay Rouge. Not really exhilarating, if nothing wrong. Sample might have needed some more maturing.
"
1," JAN 25, 2005 Bottle. Hazy brown, fruity aroma, spicy dry taste. Medium body.
"
1," 33 cl bottle. Dark red color with a huge thick light brown head. Aroma of sweet malts. Flavor of sweet malts and sugar. Very nice and smooth. Not that complex as the blue one.
"
1," Bottle @ FOneFan. Clear golden with tiny white head. Flavour is malt, little sweet,  spices, strange and skunky.
"
1," Thanks to Stfun.  Cloudy coper color. Smell of hops, malt, light citrus, orange peal and some lemon grass.  Taste of a big malt background with pine, hops, orange zest and decent dry bitterness.
"
1," On tap at Rock Bottom Charlotte.  A little bit of sweetness in the finish, although it didnt really have the guts it needed.
"
1," After a long trip to Europe - I drank my fair share of this as it was the best beer at most of the bars I came across.  A classic example of the style and one which would be great to start out on.  Always an enjoyable brew...smooth, delicate, and complex.
"
1," I actually like this better than the 10. The flavor is outstanding- burnt caramel, rasins, wine, and something smokey. The nose is slightly sweet with touches of grape and rasin. This beer makes me want to be a monk.
"
1," Found this in a chain restaurant near San Diego. Totally unexpected, but it sure made me happy. Slightly dissapointed by the beer though. Lots of head on the pour. Very fruity, more so as it warmed. Good, but nothing special. If I lived in Belgium, Id probably drink it regularly, but I can get beers just as good for a fraction of the cost.
"
1," Caramel, smokey smell.  Appearance"
1," Pours a vary dark amber brown Colour with yeast in the glass. Nice big head which kinda lingers. Aroma is lively with scents of hops, fruits, spices, and other added flavorings. Tastes like a Dr. Pepper on Steroids, with hints of Raisins, Caramel, Pecan, other nuts Pie crust and the custard of a Pecan Pie. This beverage is Highly carbonated and yeasty which greatly contributes to the overall enjoyment of the beverage. A dry nutty finish brings this distictive Malty brew into a realm that for me doesnt quit match up to its bigger brother the Grand Reserve but is a very good alternative. Kudos to Chimay. Bon Appetite!
"
1," Theyre saying this is similiar to this Westvleren12 beer that seems to be so popular around here.  I havent been able to obtain any of that to rate but I have had ChimayBleu many times and I respect and admire it .	Initially I observe dark amber/red color and thickish consistency/mouthfeel.	Nutty ethanol effervescence come second .	ITs expensive stuff but it should be required drinking to learn about the Belgians.	I havent had any in awhile, as this is a re-rate, I need to go get some !

1," Bottle @ Berlin/Bavaria Tasting, Odense. Pours clear amber with a small creamy head and lacings. Malty and fruity nose. Vaguely tart. Medium to thin body. Sweet baking powder flavor. Weird.
"
1," Fairly hoppy, somewhat bland and not as bright/fresh/creamy as I like. Had quickly diminishing light, bready malt flavor and some pineapple in the finish.
"
1," An overpowering beer that should be sipped and not gulped. Pours a cloudy dark copper with a nice soft head that lingers well. The aroma is heavily floral, bitter with spice and alcohol. Good carbonation with a medium to full body, the taste of pepper and plums overpowers the tongue and then lays there like a wet rug. I was hoping the alcohol would clean it up, but an acidic taste lingered even after the beer was finished. I can't say I didn't like this beer, it's just not my style.
"
1," Barley Island Sheet Metal Blonde is an cloudy yellow color with a quickly disappearing white head. The aroma is faint with orange, citrus and to borrow from Davinci, ""gingerbread like"" spiced qualities. The flavor is light with gingerbread notes. The finish is very light and very nice. I enjoy this beer, but find the taste a bit strange!
"
1," pours rich brown with thick small head. aroma is toasted malts, some sugar, bready yeast, and a bit of alcohol. drinks smooth and easy with nice crisp malts, bread, roast, and sugar. very good stuff.
"
1," A lovely meeting with an old friend.  1/03 bottling, still quite young.  Deep brown with a hint of red, head like a pillow that simply refuses to fade away.  Lovely aroma of raisins, yeast, and port.  Mouthfull of flavor, more raisins, more port, more yeast, combining with violets, a bit of roastiness, and something ephemeral I can only find in a chalice of Chimay.  I do think it has lost just a touch of the malty depth it used to have, but it is still worthy of homage.
"
1," Malt hop aroma. Cloudy brown colour with good head. Smooth malt hop flavour. Fizzy palate.
"
1," Really nice rich red colour.  Smooth taste considering the alcohol percent.  Head lasted throughout the glass.  Little pricey at the LC though $5 per bottle
"
1," Grand frothy white head on top of a clear pour that is a tarnished bronze color.  Fabulos-o aroma! It made my mouth water with a beautiful boquet of malts, yeasts, fruit, and citrusy hops blossoming in my nose.  Long lasting flavor with a pleasing hoppy finish.  A slight tart twinge of fruit was a fun...overall well balanced.  A savory brew.
"
1," AUG 21, 2011 Dark and rich in color, sweet and nutty in taste, a masterful beer from a masterful brewery.  One of my all time favorites.
"
1," Floral aroma with dark brown colour and good head. Bitter flavour with fizzy smooth palate.

1," Draft sampler at Barley Island. Golden color pour with a small white head that diminished quickly. Moderate sweet wheat aroma. Light body with a thin texture. Light sweet flavor with a smooth wheat finish. Soft summer brew.
"
1," 2000 vintage.  Deep brown beer.  Massive, sweet toffee, plummy/pruney fruitiness.  Massive brown sugar aroma.  Sweet toffee flavour, deep caramel, molasses.  Tasty beer.
"
1," Dark brown body with a medium tan head.  Original beer with a surprisingly wide range of flavours.  Lots of dark malts with a black liquorice and chocolaty flavour, then some kind of oak juice join in providing a nice sourness taste and all that is followed by some limy hops leaving the taste-buds a pleasant tartness.  I very much liked this beer, a lot more so than anybody here it seems.  Noblesvilles noble beer.
"
1," 750 ml from 2004. Dark brown beer a little unclear. Head brown not long lasting.		Aroma was a little disappointing with notes of caramel. I had expected more aroma, but mayby the disappearance is due to the age of the beer. 2 year.		Great taste with a good feeling in the mouth with malt and fruits and long lasting. A nice beer.
"
1," Very carbonated, fizzed up as I swashed it.  Sweet cherries, apricot, alcohol, and malt.  I was kinda dissapointed by this.  A pretty good dubbel, and seems to be pretty easy drinking.
"
1," Amber coloured. medium bodied, lightly roasty. Youre right, Oakes, this is better than the beers it has been named after.
"
1," Poured a dark brown or maybe burnt copper color and off white foam that was lacey. Aromas bread, some sort of fruit, i think pepper? and slight hops. Taste was malty but sweet, very sweet with a fruity peppered taste. strong after taste that held me wanting more...great beer, happy night for this guy
"
1," 330 ml bottle in Ravenna, Italy.  Has a roasted malty aroma, and I know it sounds weird but a slight yeasty cheese smell.  This one has a great body with an almost bourbon like taste.  The alchohol becomes more dominant in the finish, but overall great beer!
"
1," Classic Belgian, just doesnt have the sweetness and mouthfeel of Orval.
"
1," AUG 9, 2007 One of my favorite Trappist beers. Like other Trappist beers, I wish it wasnt so expensive because I would love to stock up on a few bottles.
"
1," Cask conditioned at Blackfriars, Glasgow. Described as a ""Premium Strong Ale"", but I guess most of us dont think of a 4.8% beer as ""strong"". Beautiful deep amber colour, creamy head. Nice malty aroma with caramel, and some fruity aromatic hops. Fairly malty flavour with a distinct hoppy bitterness throughout, also notes of caramel and fruit.
"
1," Bottle 50 cl. Courtesy of yespr. Pours a cloudy yellow with a dense white head. Banana and yeast in the nose - some phenols as well. Medium body, soft mouthfeel, banana and yeast with a citric touch. Theres a little cardboard there as well. Ends fairly dry. 250810
"
1," Bottled. Golden colour, mediumsized fluffy white head. Aroma is sweet malts, some saltwatery notes as well as mild notes of herbs and earth. Flavour is earth, wood, some saltwatery notes as welll as some mild notes of herbs.
"
1," Swing top bottle from Der Doppelbock. Dark brown color. Caramel and ash in the aroma. Milky, caramelly roasty flavor with licorice and ash. Caramelly flowery bitter aftertaste. Fairly alcoholic.
"
1," Loved it. Great taste. Not to strong aftertaste at all. Has the great Homerbrew type flavor that I love.
"
1," Great Canadian Beer Festival  2009  Victoria BC 	Liked this beer a lot I went back twice.  Great malt flavor a hint of honey sweetness this was tasty.
"
1," AUG 27, 2007 Sampled from small bottle. Dark brown in color with big thick head. Subtle aroma with sweet flavor. Hope to rerate soon..
"
1," Cask@GBBF2011 (as Oakwood Farm Perry Medium Dry, abv 5 %). Yellow colour, small head. Aroma is pear, some mild applelike notes as well as mild wooden notes. Flavour is pear, some mild cinnamon, yeast and mildly acidic notes.
"
1," Dull, flat, faint lemon aroma.  Clear, golden with a thin head.  Very mild flavours with a hint of lemon-wheat.  Zesty, carbonated, and quite boring.
"
1," I have never tasted a Belgian that even compares to this beer.  I not sure why they listed this as ""Chimay Bleue"" instead of the real name ""Chimay Grande Reserve"".
"
1," Initial big malty lager aroma, but there's a grating gamey quality to it after a while. Dry, with a strong vanilla marking.  An odd residual bittering -- like green olives around the pit. (Not the vegetable quality, just the bitterness.) The brown-green bottle appears to be enough to combat the skunking -- since the '6-pack' that this came in was shrinkwrapped plastic -- although the bottle had a nasty ridge at the mouth, just where it ought to be nice and smooth.  Medium straw beer, clingy milkshake foam. Underwhelming.
"
1," Good beer, but nowhere near the Blue.  It has a nice lively feel to it and a good taste, but not as complex as others of the style.  Highly rated, but youre better off with others of the variety.  For example, many from Unibrau are at least as good and cheaper.
"
1," Pours a cloudy, dark reddish brown color with an off white, dingy yellowish quickly diminishing head, and floating yeasty sediment.  Has a fruity, sweet, and sour nose similar to a flemish sour ale. (at least liefman goudenband)  Initial taste strikes me as fairly dry and bland and then opens up into a spiced fruitiness, with a clove-like coriander flavor with an almost dull numbing effect.  This could also be the intense over carbonation that almost strips and dries the tongue.  Overall, quite drinkable for a fairly high alcohol beer, but I not a big fan of the clove spiced flavors in this and in hefeweizens.
"
1," from pivnizub. Cloudy, very cloudy and very yeasty beer with some larger yeast floaties. Wheaty and yeasty, shy fruity touch. Very smooth.
"
1," Appearance is a reddish brown with little head.	Flavor is quite malty with faint hops and some grain in the aftertaste. This is not one of Big River's better beers but it was a decent effort.
"
1," JUL 11, 2011 Bottle. Poured a rich medium to dark brown with a small off-white foamy head that was fully diminishing and had fair lacing. The aroma was of roasted malts, a mild flowery hops and a light scent of a sweet yeast with notes of dried fruit. It tasted slightly bitter-sweet in the beginning with a hint of raisons and finished moderately sweet and malty and had a slight alcohol tinge at the end with the flavor only lasting a short time. Mouthfeel was medium in body and very creamy yet oily in texture. Overall a fantastic/outstanding brew with one hell of a kick. One of my favorites, but dont drink too many!!!!!!
"
1," a spicy,yeasty aroma with a light.flowery wheat and malty touch,like a port wine as well..i think uh oh here it comes not being a fan of belgian ales..cloudy brown/red with dissipating head no lacing..good appearance on its own but again..uh oh...taste hits you with yeast and malts and a burnt sugar caramel flavor in the back..if there are many hops they are of the spicy herbal variety more felt as a tingle than an actual component of the taste..quite wine like taste apparent as well..drinkability..well..its hot tonight and this is kind of heavy even objectively its a little unevenly balanced towards the sweet side so a 3 will do..overall..classic belgian really with a wine like quality probably great with rich food or dessert but as a session beer..nah..and at 6 bucks a bottle..(that means at least 25 dollars to catch a good buzz lol) there are better 6-7 dollar beers out there
"
1," 25.4 oz bottle. Pours a cloudy caramel color with a one-and-a-half-finger off-white head. The aroma is of malt, yeast, cherry, plum and caramel. The flavor is bitter then sweet and bubbly with yeast and malt prevalent. Very good.
"
1," DEC 13, 2005 33cl. Tumbler. Subtlety is the triumph of this dark Belgian ale. Murky brown reflecting hints of orange and gold. Lots of softness in the aroma, palate and head, and a flavor profile which while it doesnt rip off my taste buds is pleasant, lingering and complex. Not good at flavor descriptions but possible dried fruits, malt is sweet. Aroma persists like decent wine. Soft fluffy head like an angels pillow. Fine carbonation adds to impression of softness. No grandstanding, just all simple class. Quite comforting and more-ish, highly drinkable. Would like to age some.<P> Slight overall re-rate (Impression .2pts, and .1 for appearance, 3 was too low) - This one is ageing well at 18 months or so, the spicy fruit flavors open up a bit! .3 more awarded.
"
1," Nice fruity and yeasty aroma.  Pours brownish with a small tan head.  Flavor is sweet, but not overly, nicely balanced.  Full bodied, with a dry finish.  Pretty well rounded and nice.
"
1," Pitch black. Tan, long-lasting cover. Initially straight espresso nose quickly unveils a pleasant array of fruity goodness. Deeply vinous profile marries bot the strong grapey, blackberry profile with the alcohol warmth. Almost no bitterness noticeable. The hops are drowned under the malts, which nevertheless never appear overly sweet, certainly not cloying. A bit of higher alcohols are part of the game though, as headache enducing rubbery/pasticy undertones are felt in the background. Nothing major though, excellently integrated fruity goodness. Portly, yet balanced with this coffee-like roast finish. Medium-heavy bodied, moderate carbonation. One to finish the night.
"
1," Grand Reserve 2007 75CL Bottle. Drank in a Westvleteren glass, thick head, more complex than the regular Chimay Blue, much smoother and enjoyable... Absolutely no signs of bitterness, very sweet, candy sugar, caramel comes to mind. For me there is a big difference between the Grand Reserve and the regular Chimay which I tasted back to back both 2007 vintage...
"
1," Nashville.  The only beer that I enjoyed.  Barely opaque and inky dark brown in color.  No head, only the barest touch of dust.  The glass even feels heavier than the others.  Semi-sweet chocolate brownies with a touch of Hershey syrup drizzled on top, and melted caramel, comprise the aroma.  Mostly reserved in terms of smell, but decent in its own right.  Sweet Toll house chocolate chips come through in the flavor, along with chocolate covered mocha beans.  Scaled carbonation and chocolate milk tendencies help to keep this one heads and shoulders above the rest of this brewerys offerings.  Delectable chocolate caramel interaction to a point I wouldnt have thought possible.  Melted truffle finish.  A great end to a miserable night.
"
1," Bottle. Tasted double blind. Courtesy of yespr. Pours a cloudy orange with no head. Fruity nose, lots of yeast and phenols. Solid body, low carbonation, very sweet fruit, a little barrel perhaps and again some phenols. Rather heavy alcohol in the finish. 190211

"
1," A purple black color with fine fluffy head.  Sweet malty aroma.  Hints of raisen in the aroma.  From my memory, this beer used to be packed with much more flavor (circa 1992) than it has now.  It is good, but just a bit thin. Great aroma that you would expect to accompany a full-bodied malty brew - not the case.
"
1," Bottle 2010. Nice aroma of strong malt with some complex woody notes. Strong tasting. Malty liquor flavours; alcohol and liquorish dominate though. Cant help but think this is just strong brown Trappist nonsense.
"
1," (12oz bottle, thanks kmweaver) Brown-black body topped by small tan head.  Aroma is moderately sweet, coffee, some cola, light chocolate, anise.  Taste is moderately sweet, coffee, some chocolate, light cinnamon/anise, roast.  Light-medium body with a touch of syrup.
"
1," 12 oz bottle.  Dark brown with a thick tan head that settles with some lacing.  Nose is coffee, musty brown sugar, bourbon and some chocolate.  Medium body with a tang.  Taste is sour bourbon and chocolate.  Dry and woody with grapefruit peel.
"
1," Thanks to Cavie for sharing this bottle. 		The beer pours a reddish-amber color with a cream-colored head. The aroma is caramel and toffee malt, about what you would expect from a brown ale. The flavor is more of the same, with the addition of some grassy hops which add a slight bit of bitterness. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation.
"
1," A stout is beautiful. Dark, seductive, sensual, as soft as a velveteen sky and as complex as the cosmos it blankets within. There are those who are afraid of the dark beers, but I say nay, there is nothing to fear but fear itself. Well, that and a bad beer; that is beyond scary at times. When my beer line-up was brought before me, the two beers my eyes and my tastebuds gravitated to immediately were the stout and the special brew, Belgian-style golden ale. I am saving the special brew for last, so instead I am faced with my dark beauty, the Iron Horse Stout.		An abyssal black-brown, there can be seen very little discernable light struggling through her depths. A thick khaki head fades to happy scattered puffs while lace decorates the sides of my glass. Right away my nose is greeted by espresso, bakers and dark chocolate, hints of cream, and lemon rind. Well played. I wait for no-one when it comes to my stouts, supping greedily upon her dark brew. Her body and mouthfeel is surprisingly thin with hints of lemon in her dry finish. Light notes of cream remind me of skim milk while chocolates, espresso, and sweet raisins play with my tastebuds. Her finish continues to dry my mouth with lingering esters of bakers chocolate and lemon. Simple and clean, the palate is there but the mouthfeel is a bit on the weak side which detracts somewhat from my enjoyment of the Iron Horse Stout.		Overall, she is not a bad stout. The Iron Horse Stout from Seven Bridges would be a great starter stout for those who wish to dabble in the dark brews without being scared away. She lacks the oomph, but has the spirit.
"
1," APR 12, 2009 Small bottle from 2003 (4 years old). Foamy head, deep brown color. A sweet taste of caramel, 9% is well hidden in this very good ale. 8-4-9-5-17=4,3.		  Tasted many times since then, both fresh and aged. I like it more and more, and has to give it 4,5 now. Fruity, sweet malty, spicy, hints of bitterness and a fine touch of alcohol. Smooth. Not a tastebombe, yust extremely nice and well made.
"
1," Bottle; 33cl, Beermerchants		Poured into goblet trappist glass, some descent lacing diminishes; descent dark-mahogany appearance. Some deep reds in this for sure. 		Aroma is spices; toffee, caramel, tingling yeast - quite douughey, taste is alcohol, clove, dried figs, raisins, caramel, some soy source, a distinctly raw texture-generally a very complicated brew, ages well though. Its low ibu and can be put down for a long time. 		Over aging the caramel evolves and becomes thicker and the texture becomes more sherry like, the booze is heavy and the candy sugar roles off the tongue. Its a good beer but best in the Kulminator with friends, some cheese and a serious whack of aging. Old beer can be good.
"
1," Wow, I never rated this? One of the only decent beers at Pocono Brewing Company on bottle. Enjoyable with an accent on the fruits and yeast versus the typical malty dubbel. Nice mix of hops to add bitterness. The palate isnt as wowing as other dubbels and is a bit dull. But a decent beer nonetheless.
"
1," For some reason, I was a bit disappointed by this one.  I love Chimay Red, but I found the roasted flavours and alcohol taste a bit too overpowering in the Blue.  However, I have never seen a beer with such a thick, rich head which is evidence of its quality.  Nevertheless, I think I will stick to the more mellow Belgians.

1," Very high quality belgian ale, highly carbonated and very smooth. Dark fruits overwhelm the taste, but overall nothing stands out too much to make it a really amazing ale.
"
1," Crystal clear amber body with off-white head.  Aroma is medium sweet, fruity (berry).  Taste is medium sweet, lager yeast, caramel/berry.  Light body with a hint of stickiness, some acidity.
"
1," My dad said this was an excellent beer. This is a cloudy muddy brown in color. I really noticed the aroma as I tasted it, an interesting complex smell I liked. I really noticed the complexity of the taste in the first couple of tastes. Im no expert so I cant tell what it was. But the more I drank, the less distinguished these flavors became. By the middle of the beer, it seemed like an decent ordinary beer. But I realized as I was finishing, this was tasty and interesting. All in all, a good beer but not the best Ive had.

1," Its not as intense as the blue, but smoother
"
1," FEB 27, 2007 1.5L Magnum sampled out of a Trappist glass.  One of my favorite beers!  Very tight amber/light ruby head.  Smells of delicious yeast (even moreso out of the 1.5L bottle) and floral aromas.  Ruby red/brown color.  PHENOMENALY complex taste which seems to me to be dominated by roasted malts...but I love it!  Moderate to high carbonation.  Pleasent, mildly sweet finish.  Yet another fine beer from Chimay!
"
1," APR 3, 2004 Great beverage, could never tell it's 9%.  Has a beautiful color with a nice nutty caramel flavor.  Finish is not too strong.  Highly recommended		Re-rate 4/4/04.  Pour is a hazy mahognay with an off white head.  Aroma is yeasty without much else going on.  Start is quite malty with some hops, but the finish is very thin and watery. I think I overreated this guy the first time.
"
1," Smells like a tootsie roll. darker head and good lacing. Finishes chocolate. Good overall.
"
1," Draft at Chattanooga location. Deep black in the glass with a thick creamy tan head that lasted and produced decent lacing. The aroma was of chocolate and coffee. The flavor was a nice chocolate, coffee, and roast with a hint of lemon. Light to medium body with a coffee aftertaste.
"
1," A truely great beer. Is everything that a belgian ale should be. Sufficently thick and sweet. A wonderful beer for the price.
"
1," Dark reddish brown,decent head. Apples, raisins, caramel. Alcohol bitterness seems slightly more pronounced that I would like, but still very solid flavor. Nice carbonation, yet smooth. Good beer.
"
1," Wow, I dont understand the hate on this beer - seems to me to be a good light summer beer.  Pours very pale yellow tih a fluffy and fizzy off-white head.  The aroma has sweet american style wheat graininess, a bit of spice, light paper aspects and some lemony citrus.  Medium / thin body that is smooth and pleasant with extra sharp carbonation on the finish.  The flavors start with some spice with some mellow wheat, grain, grassiness and light nectarine.  The finish has spicy hops and a bit of lemony citrus.    Nothing that will knock your socks off, but a nice light enjoyable summer beer.

"
1," bottle sample at Darklord Day - Pours a hazy dark brown with a nice head.  Theres a fairly assertive aroma of dark fruit and yeast.  The flavor is mostly of malts and dark fruits, finely balanced in a full bodied ale with a little alcohol apparent, but not in an unpleasant way.    The finish is quite nice with some mild hops and it lingers on the palate for a bit.  Excellent.

1," JAN 11, 2009 Looks like a coke with a frothy mountainous head till you hold it up to the light where you can see the opaque off red tint. Its aroma is nice, but  a bit faint. Dark fruits and rum mostly. The taste is beautiful, with just the right kick to make it fun. It goes down creamy smooth, the texture is perfect. To top this all off, the price is right! Bought as Chimay Ale"
1," Pours a milky brown color with yeast all over. Aroma is that of wine, alcohol, and medicine. Flavor is fruit, apples, apricot, and yeast. Very much like wine. This is a style that takes getting used to. Overall, interesting.
"
1," Poured a dark brown color with medium head.  Aroma of brown sugar and spices.  Med sweetness,  lite bitter.  Med bodied, creamy palate, ave carbonation.  Smooth tasting.  Full complex flavor.  Slightly chaulky.  Sweet molassis sugar flavors.
"
1," I finally managed to get this beer.  It had great colour and a deep fruity aroma.  It's taste however seemed very bland.  It certainly had a good malty presance, but its hoppy taste was light and the beer lacked that fruity taste i find common in the style. Maybe i got a bad bottle.
"
1," Bottles acquired in trades with Sephiroth & BigErn (thanks!). Poured a dark black with a large sized tan head. Aromas of strong coffee grounds with roast, and chocolate. Tastes of coffee, roast, oats, and light vanilla. Now this is what I expect from a coffee beer - strong aroma and tastes of coffee!
"
1," Bottle from Oddbins.  Very effervescent.  Pours deep ruby/brown with off-white head that rapidly diminished.  Winey aroma, malt only hinted at, and a touch of rich, dried fruit.  Smoky, spicy taste, with lots of plummy/raisin fruit - in fact it tastes like its aroma - and a very dry finish.  Relatively light for a 9% beer.  Words of mine cant do justice to this masterpiece.
"
1," Black pour with a tan head. Aroma of coffee, roasted, malts and burnt chocolate. Flavor of roasted malts. Burnt. Light to medium body.
"
1," Delicious. My favorite of the Chimay line although the white is a close close 2nd. Creamy smooth velvety palate is my favorite trait of this one. Dark fruit flavor with a slight alcohol bite. Somewhat yeasty too.

1," (650ml bottle) Purchased at the Sailor Hagars Off-Sale for ~$5. Pours a lasting white foamy head with a deep orange. Nose of orangey english hops. Bitter and lightly fruity flavour. Solid to style.

1," Draught@brewpub (Portland, OR)	Dark nut brown color, small beige head. Toasted coffee in the otherwise caramelly nose. Light to medium bodied. Sweetish caramelly flavor with coffee and coffee beans. Not  really a porter, more like a sweetish red ale with coffee.

"
1," Much too decadent of a stout to be clocking in at a mere 4.9%; theres huge chocolate and mocha flavors abound in this bottle.  The hops are kept to a minimum, but the slick texture prevents any unwelcome sugar build-up on the finish.  Plus, the low ABV means you can drink a couple without risking tossing bar stools at the jukebox when ""Take On Me"" comes on.  (2008)
"
1," Strong flavour and aroma of chocolate, raisons, figs, caramel, spices, and fruits. At 9%, the alcohol taste is somewhat present. Overall an excellent beer that I wish was not just seasonally offered where I live. If you can find it, try it.
"
1," Bottled.  This is a very smooth dubbel that is warming, yet is not very heavy or hard to drink.  The slight hop makes the finish very complex and satisfying.  I enjoyed this immensely.
"
1," The 25.4 ounce amber bottle poured a beautiful amber colored slightly hazy beverage with an off-white foamy head that was mostly diminishing but left good lacing on the glass. The aroma was sweet and spicy with notes of Belgian candy, fresh fruits, coriander, orange and pepper. The body was medium-full with lively but soft carbonation and a smooth creamy texture. The flavors start off lightly sweet with the sweetness gradually replaced with a soft spiciness through the medium-long finish. There is also a nice alcohol warmth at the end.
"
1," JAN 31, 2010 Wonderful thick red colour with decent head. Very fruity in both smell and taste and you wouldnt notice its strenght. Also a bit sweet (but not too sweet). A strong beer that you can have a few of.

1," Big fan of this lager. One of my favorite beers and its brewed locally. Great taste.

1," Tap.  Sour malt aroma with leather and hop notes.  Pours pale gold with a very thin white head.  Sour malt aroma with a hop twang.  Light and fizzy palate.
"
1," APR 29, 2003 Lest complex of Chimays beers. A slight taste of raisins, nether malt or hops stand out really its a refreshing beer. Could be my version of the worlds best beer to drink on a hot day but most would not agree with me here
"
1," Nose of grapefuit and pine. The citrus is dank and musky though, not bright. Flavor follows nose for the most part,  but less pine. Good malt in finish to provide balance. Finish is long with lingering bitterness. Overall, a nice American IPA.
"
1," Dark brown with a dense beige head. Aroma is malty with candy like esters. Flavour is also malty, very round and fruity but with less yeasty flavours than the nose delivers. Body drags this one down for me, too fizzy with sharp carbonation, needs a long time to settle in the glass.
"
1," Not bad but not spectacular either.  I had the regular and the cask version, and the cask version was a definite improvement.  Its kind of toned down though.  I didnt get a lot of hops out of this, for it to be an IPA.  I did detect a pleasant vanilla character in this beer, especially in the cask one.  If this is the most aggressive brew in the house, then they need to hand out booster seats at the door.  A kiddie IPA for sure.
"
1," 330ml bottle, poured into Palm glass. Two finger tanned head. Dark ruby colour. Strong fruity aroma. Tasted cherries, chocolate and mousse au chocolat. So smooth, great texture. Top beer.
"
1," 650ml brown bottle. Orange colour. Holds a very creamy, small white head and leaves decent lace. Lightly spiced nose, with ginger and nutmeg standing out. Light malt base with some cinnamon and nutmeg notes, some light gingery heat. Light bitterness. Fairly strong carbonation, medium bodied.
"
1," Pours a golden orange with a pretty thin head that disappears quickly.  Aroma is light and somewhat sweet...not a lot of hops, and even a dash of sourness mixed in...pretty odd for an APA.  Flavor is some burnt malts, and a whole lot of bitterness, without much of a hop profile coming through otherwise...maybe a hint of the Cascade hops, but Im striving to find much.  Palate is a bit watery and underwhelming.  Not a very impressive beer, which seems to be all about being bitter...concur with others that this is a bit confusing for the style.
"
1," Big thanks to Doug Shoemaker for hooking me up with this! Appearance is dark brown with a light brown head. Aromas are spicy, floral, and fruity. Very complex. Taste is bitter with some fruit and sour notes. Aftertaste is sour with a nice bitterness on the palate. An amazing trappist. Thanks Doug!
"
1," Bottle. Hazy brownish colour with a huge off white head. Rich aroma and taste of malts, dark fruits, spice and yeast. Nice mouthfeel.
"
1," (bottle, purchased at the brewery) Clear, pale golden colour with a blond medium-sized foamy head. Pale malty, mildly grainy aroma with citric and slightly floral hops. Moderately sweet flavour, light to medium bodied with a soft carbonation. Slightly grainy malty base with subtle fruity and herbal hops; almost dry sweet and mildly bitter finish with grainy and herbal hoppy notes. Clean and well-balanced Helles. 06.V.10
"
1," Dark brown-red colored with vanishing yellow head. Grainy aroma with lemon and some chocolate, thin rye also comes up. Medium bodied. Flavor has similar rye-chocolate tone dominating, aftertaste dries with lemon and yeast, thin grains also here.
"
1," Nice head and nice color but I am not fond of the taste.  Not bad.
"
1," A sweet flavor that dry and a bit bitter, but in a good way.  Semi-sweet aftertaste.  Unique beer.
"
1," Pours dark brown with medium-sized beige head; aroma of dark fruit, spices, hints of licorice and floral notes; medium to full-bodied, smooth carbonation; flavor of caramel malt, fruits and hot spiciness; a kind of empty finish leaves you waiting for the climax to come (vainly); the aftertaste, then, coming sort of delayed, is really the best part of the beer including rich notes of caramel, ripe fruits, licorice and spices.
"
1," Draught at the brewpub.  Clear pale yellow, airy head. Grassy hops drives it. Dry and unusually soft for a pils with medium body and balanced bitter finish. A well made pilsener.
"
1," on tap-pours an off white head and gold color.  Aroma is sweet citrus hops, some medium malt.  Taste is sweet citrus hops-some bitter, secondary medium malt.  Soft effervescence.  Good session PA.
"
1," Pours a dark brown with a nice tan head.  Smell of spice, dark fruit, sugar and alchohol.  Very good beer but every sip I took I could not get past the fact that this bottle tasted like a barleywine to me....
"
1," Bottle 33 cl. A mahogany colour with a white (small bubbly) head. The aroma of sweet, fruity and some yeast. The carbonation is good. It has a medium sweet taste, some yeast and maybe caramel. A beer that met my expectations but not the best Chimay
"
1," On cask at Cloisters. Pours a dark golden colour with a fair white head. Blueberry aroma with caramel, barley and yeast. Similar flavours. Mild carbonation. Quite fruity and not really my thing.
"
1," Red-braun in color.A fruty and sweet aroma. Has a spicy flavor. Classic Belgian beer! Not the last time I will have this one.
"
1," Pours a dark amber colour with a tall frothy off white head. Aroma is fruity malt and some yeast. Taste is also fruity with hints of caramel and yeast. Little bitterness in the finish. Probably the weaker of the Chimays but still a beautiful beer.
"
1," Rich aroma of malt and dark fruit with some sourness and yeast. Organic ruddy dark brown look with a dense pillowey tan head that never quits. Flavors of plum, malt, alcohol and a bit of coffee and some muskiness. I also get a bit of rum flavor. Relatively bitter for the style. Somewhat lacking in body.
"
1," Too bright (clear) for style and gold in color on top of that.  The base beer should not be this rich gold in color even if it is filtered.  It has a thin, white head.  Definite wheat overtones in the aroma with spicy, clovey yeast character, a twist of lemon, and coconut milk.  Flavor is very strange, but not bad.  I taste some nutmeg and a lot of pina colada with a spicy, nutmeg dryness.  This is almost one of those alco-pops.
"
1," Hazy auburn topped with a good white head. Carmel malt aromas mostly, with some hops thrown in. Starts off pretty sweet with strong malts and a good balance of flowery hops. Long, bitter finish. Pretty good.
"
1," Some fruity aroma.  The color is a nice deep orange/rust color.  The flavor is subtle, but there is some fruitiness to it.  It has good carbonation and a nice creamy head.  Overall, a great beer.
"
1," Yellow/orange color, hazy with nice dense rocky off-white head.  Citrus nose with hint of malt mingled in.   Good start.   Green hop flavor, kind of muddled hop flavor upon first sip.   Malt profile is thin, this is focused on the hops but they are not clean and balanced which is disappointing given aroma and look in the glass.   Hop flavor is cloying and lingers around too long.   Not something Id order a second time.
"
1," poured brown and murky with off white head not that knowledgeable on this style lots of lacing meduim body aromas of dark fruits,malts,hops and raisen bread taste is of grains,bread,yeast,and licorice
"
1," Pours brown with a white head.  Spicy malty aromas.  Flavors of brown sugar, raisin, molassas and toffee.  Lingers on the palate.  Overall an awesome beer from folks that have been brewing for a couple hundred years.
"
1," Very good, but lacking the complexity of the Bleu. Piles of pillowy head atop a burgundy amber body. This beer is rife with fruity flavors, especially cranberry, raspberry, and cherry. A medium woody hint complements the mildly spicy yeasty finish. Finishes a little syrupy.
"
1," Draught in Chattanooga.  Pours mahagony-copper with a medium frothy tan head and some decent lacing as well.  Malt (grain, straw, hay) and yeast (sweat) aroma with light roasted caramel malt and corn notes.  Malt adjucnt flavor with a bitter acidic yeast and nutty body.  Medium bodied and dry palate, refreshing.
"
1," Good way to start my ratings.Nice aroma and cloudy  but interesting appearance.Nice lightly bitter taste and bitter aftertaste but could make for a good dinner beer.
"
1," A delicious-looking cloudy brown beer with a large tan head that lasts. The aroma is a pleasant sweet fruity malt-based smell with some earthy and yeasty notes. The flavor is a bit weaker, but interesting, with some dark and dried fruit with roasty notes. Mouthfeel is a little thin.
"
1," An orange beer with a disappearing beige head. The aroma is sweet with primary notes of straw, but also a slight acidity. The flavor is sweet malty - combined with a slight acidity as well as hints of metal. The alcohol prickles the tongue slighlty, but the body is thin.
"
1," On tap at BR. A lightly hazed yellow pour. Corriander and bannanas dominate with a hint of clove. Bannanas carry the flavor with a hint of clove and even a touch of a finishing bitter. Thin and slightly foamy but very drinkable.
"
1," Wonderful fruity aroma of apricot. Creamy head and wonderful copper color. Flavor is robust, with a silky texture and LOTS of carbonation. Semi-dry and very complex. Quite delicious
"
1," JUL 28, 2004 Pours with a very strong head.  the 12 oz bottle almost didnt fit in the pounder I had it in.  The galss is half gone and there is still a layer of foam.  Lacing is strong also  Dk copper color. Aroma and flavor is quite unusual.  Took me a few minutes to put my finger on it but I think it is a hint of cloves, or similar spice.    Feel and drinkability is very good though.  Smooth and silky.  A highly rated brew that is not one of my favorites.
"
1," FEB 9, 2004 brown in colour, few foam, malt and caramel aroma with hint of plum, slightly overcarbonated, bubblegum-like mouthfeel, some sweetness followed by a tart bitterness with a synthetic malty finish - it's hard to imagine that this was once a true world classic (and don't tell me this beer has not changed during the last years !); what is the motivation of the Chimay guys to commit such a suicide ?? - this is now the most overrated beer in the world.
"
1," Quickly vanishing head, dark red coloring. Smells of roasted coffee. Nice taste with chocolates and some bitters. Good palate which lingers. Nice brew, 1st dark bock from the brewmaster.
"
1," tate it and you will never forget it !! nothing to compare to the most common bier in USA. So strong that three of them is enough for your night !!!(its a pity to drink three of them in the same night, you will taste only the first one ... ).
"
1," Stil looks like the Chimay Blue I used to love, but all the complexity of old is missing. Is it no longer being matured for long enough by the brewery or is malt extract being used? Something is missing that I cant put my finger on, but to me, this is now a very simple beer. Tried it next to a Rochefort 10, which might be why Im so jaded, but it used to and should still stand this comparison. It doesnt.
"
1," AUG 28, 2007 33 cl. bottle.  Pour is dark brown with a medium sized tan head which fell quickly and completely.  The aroma is sweet (cocoa) malt and a hint of Belgian yeast.  Flavor is semi-sweet malt, the Belgian yeast and a bit of earthiness that was a little old tasting.  Overall, this was a good beer, but did not taste fresh, or like it was aging.  It tasted over the hill.  Perhaps I got a poorly handled bottle.
"
1," Cask (gravity) @ National Winter Ales Festival 2009, Manchester, England.Clear medium to dark brown color with a average, frothy, good lacing, mostly diminishing, off-white head. Aroma is moderate malty, roasted, bread, sugar, chemistry, burnt plastic notes. Flavor is moderate sweet and bitter with a average duration. Body is medium, texture is watery to oily, carbonation is soft to flat. [20090122]
"
1," cask-pours a rich retaining light tan head and copper color.  Aroma is medium malt, some citrus/earthy hops.  Taste is medium malt, some citrus/earthy hops, some bitter.  Soft carbonation.
"
1," Cloudy brown with a tan head that seems to last forever. Oddly, lacing is nil. Sweet, fruity nose some figs, apricot, slightly malty. Silky mouthfeel, a touch creamy, good light carbonation. Flavor is considerably lighter than other Chimay brews I have tried, not as complex. Fruity but not quite as sweet as the nose implies, apricot and malt, a touch of pepper. Fairly clean finish, but it leaves me wanting. A good dubbel, but feels incomplete.
"
1," This white wax covered bottled brew from a bottle shop poured a small sized head of foamy finely sized tan colored bubbles that were long lasting and left behind a hazy strongly carbonated . The strong aroma was vinous raspberry and malt hop. The mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and at the finish with a medium vinous aftertaste. The nice flavor contained notes of malt hops vinous and raisin. Delicious and one I would certainly buy again.
"
1," OCT 26, 2008 33 cl bottle. Pours hazy copper to amber with a medium white head. Malty aroma is somewhat hoppy, spicy and a bit yeasty. Dark, sweetish fruity aromas are close to wine gums. Somethng like raisins or dates, maybe also plums. Flavor is something from sweetish to sour"
1," Nice hop flavor, light copper color.
"
1," Bottle. Aroma of roasted malt. A hint of oatmeal cerealness. Fairly faint aroma. Pours black with a creamy khaki head. Flavor was lightly roasted malt. A hint of creamy sweetness. A tiny bit of coffee and chocolate (I think I stretching here). Creamy with good carbonation. Finishes a tad watery. Nothing spectacular here.
"
1," (330ml bottle)Orangey brown, big creamy head which leaves nice laces.  Apple, apricot, yeast and alcohol aroma.  It has malty, pepery slightly fruity flavors.  I'll drink the 750 ml bottle pretty soon and see if there's a big difference.
"
1," Small bottle.  Pours a deep brown with a nice tan head.  Dark fruit flavors and aromas are present from first sniff/sip.  I need to revisit this without interrupting with food, but  I was pleasantly surprised.
"
1," By far, one of the best Belgian ales around.  A must have.
"
1," Draught at Chattanooga.	Deep amber with a good creamy head. Fruity aroma. Nice balanced palate. Not great, but better than I expected from a chain type brewpub.
"
1," not much going in either hps or malt. just a basic amber ale from what I tasted
"
1," Bottle.  Burnt coffee bean and roasted malt aroma.  Pitch black with small long lasting tan head and nice lacing.   Slightly sweet dark chocolate malt and burnt coffee flavor.  Nicely blended.  Nice strong stout.
"
1,"	Chestnuts and polite caramel swim within this tame Imperial Brown Ale, lightened by watery passages and citrusy hop angles. 		Further Personal Perceptions"
1," Pours dark brown with a foamy off-white head. Malty, spicy nose with herbs. Malty aroma, slightly hoppy. Sweet elements occasionally. Notes of toffee, raisins, dried fruits. A bit yeasty. Less carbonated than for example Chimay Blanche having a positive effect on mouthfeel.
"
1," bottle.  brown pour with clarity.  foamy off white head.  light dark fruit, mild cherry, oak, deep malty aroma.  smooth and mellow.  well balanced.  malt body is nutty and rich.  enjoyable.
"
1," Decent brown ale.  Cloudy and unfiltered.  Fruity malt taste.  Presents better than it tastes.  Very interested to visit the brewery in Noblesville.
"
1," Pours a dark red, coppery color.  Foamy white head.  Nose of apricots, citrus, perhaps some caramel and hops.  Flavor is citrus and hops, with an overall sweetness.  I think I beginning to love Belgians more and more..
"
1," Botella. Comprada en supermercado. No tan buena como esperaba, pero muy buena igual.
"
1," Bottled.  Clear golden, firm rich head. Light grassy nose. Dry despite fair mounts of sweet buttery malt. Fairly soft and a bit spritzy. Salty finish with short bitterness. Really good until the flavour dies abruptly.
"
1," BottledLight hop aroma. My first one from this country. Pale golden color, no carbonation. First sweetish flavor, then light fruity with alcohol notes. Quite bitter, light dry finish. Quite unbalanced beetween hoppy and malty.
"
1," Thanks to Hippie4beer for this one as a nice bonus beer.  Pours a nice deep amber/brown with a pretty nice lasting foamy head.  Aroma is phenolic with slight solvent and rubbery hints and light caramel.  Light caramel sweetness, herbal tea-like hops, more off phenols, and astringent finish.
"
1," Bottle.  Chocolate malt aroma.  Dark brown color with large head.  Light chocolate, brown sugar, and roasted malt flavor.  Light hops finish.  Nice light brown ale.

1," Aroma smells of figs and plum, with a bit of alcohol.  Slightly warming in the mouth, but very welcoming.  An almost buttery, toffee flavor follows.  Strong banana notes throughout.  A thoroughly enjoyable beer...I am very glad I chose this for my first rating!

1," This is a light to medium bodied brown ale with a mild flavor. nothing bad, nothing outstanding. just average
"
1," In its glass, while dining out. Dark ruby beer with a finger width off-white head. Sweet malty, caramel apple aroma. Sweet taste of tropical fruit (pears and figs), and just enough bitterness to balance it. Very nice.
"
1," kinda new at this, my first trappist beer, but I really enjoyed it. I am starting to acquire a taste for the style, and I think this one has set the bar pretty high..  but have lots more to try.. anyway, this one pours a dark walnut brown color, very little head..  great, earthy aroma.. flavor is bitter, but actually seemed a bit sweet too... almost a plum flavor to it..  cant wait to try the other Chimays
"
1," Pint at BI - I havent had this in the past and Jeff Eaton (owner of BI) said they have been ""tweaking"" the recipe.  Aroma is crisp citrus hops, pine and earthy carmel malts.  Pours hazy orange/brown with a medium head and good lacing.  Flavor is initially a citrus hop zing that quickly fades to a chalky maltiness.  Palate is rather thin for such aroma and flavor.  I say keep tweaking until you can make it finish as well as the IPA and you will have a great APA.  Certianly worthwhile as is.
"
1," From bottle, consumed in my beautiful Chimay goblet.  The smell is strong of yeast, great yeast, and nuttyness with a slight bit of malt in there to boot.  Taste is first strong of sweet malt, caramel, butter (not in a bad diacetyl way), and floral bursts giving way to a great smooth malty goodness.  The alcohol helps this monumental beer ease down the palate, while not distracting from the smooth taste.  All I can say is, wow!
"
1," Wow! this one was amazing.  Aroma is chocolate, coffee, vanilla.  Appearance is jet black with nice tan head that dissipates to thin ring.  Lots of lace.  Taste is coffee, chocolate, vanilla, slight hops, heavy malt, oatmeal.  Palate is silky smooth, some lactose in there to smooth around the edges and sweeten a bit.  Overall, very impressed! I walked out of the brewery and saw they won a silver metal at the GABF.  Should have won gold!
"
1," Dark orange pour with an off white head. Aroma of cereal, sweet caramel, some light hops. light hoppy flavor with burnt caramel backing. About as average as an ipa gets.
"
1,"	Clean but missing the floral hoppy ending I like in my pils. A bit thin bodied, not much malt their either. Not really flawed, but on the boring side.
"
1," Pours deliciously releasing a wonderful aroma and a thick head. Nice amber hues deliver a great flavor that is amazing to the tastebuds. My favorite Abbey beer
"
1," Easily tops their other beers (except for the House IPA) in character and flavor. Very true to style with a pleasing sweetness that's not overpowering. Reminds me of Sweet Georgia Brown from Sweetwater Brewing (although not quite as good).
"
1," Draft at Brewers Rendezvous. Tasting of 7/10/10. Pours a thin white head, over a dark yellow (SRM 4) body......nose is biscuit, toast, light cereal...taste is light cereal, with mild hop bite....mouth feel is light. carbonation medium. Although this meets the style it is very light in all characteristics. BJCP 4//3/10/4/5.
"
1," pours dark amber/brown with a large sustaining tan head.  aroma is fruity, molasses, maple syrup.  flavor is much of the same, plum, raisin, alcohol.  highly carbonated, light body.  alcohol is very noticable and warm going down.
"
1," Great Canadian Beer Festival  2009  Victoria BC 	The very malty pale ale.  This was dark but tasty.  I was very happy to drink this brew.  	They know there beer and seem to have a good following.
"
1," Cask handpull at The Bell & Crown Canterbury. Mid gold colour with thin lasting white head. Now this may look like a golden ale but it is very much a bitter.  Some hay straw hop aroma but then fullish in moith with really hop on the finish mix of earth and citrus. Its in great nick too. Two beers from this brewery and they have both been really good.  Lovely bitter light coloured bitter with some lemon curd. Really full in mouth and flavour
"
1," Corked bottle. Golden color. Malty bready aroma with citrus. Woody hop flavor. Grassy with soft citrus notes. The hops push away the malty notes. Woody, even a bit perfumed finish. Lacks some balance.
"
1," bottle, thank you MoritzF! Golden colour, slightly hazy, large white head. Full-bodied, pleasantly malty with a decent amount of hops.
"
1," Man this is good.  Brown color with a light head.  Quite a bit of carbonation.  Very thick mouth feel.  Definite alcohol presence in the mouth.
"
1," Pours a murky light brown, with a persistent light tan head. Aroma is spicy and tangy, like slightly sour milk. Taste is burnt caramel with a big hit of malty sweetness, toast and nuts. Nice carbonation, medium bodied and nice drinking.
"
1," Fruity, cellar, Sisu pastilles. Taste"
1," Bottle. Pours pale amber color with a thin white head that fades to a collar. Aroma grassy and grainy with a lemon scent. Taste is more malt and grain with grass too. Palate is thin and chaulky that finishes dry. Note a bad lager!

1," Large Chimay Premiere Bottle.  Pours dark red, brown, with large fading head.  There is a faintly spicy aroma, not strong.  Tastes yeasty, bitter with sweet malt, wood, cherry, a bit of chocolate, alcohol.
"
1," MAY 15, 2003 Brown in color, with a thick, creamy off-white head that lingers, leaving sheets of lacing.  Aroma is malty, slightly yeasty, fruity (banana and apple).  Malty sweet start, middle is fruity with banana and some apple, and an acidic finish.  Body is on the fuller side of medium.
"
1," Grat tasting IPA.  Lots of fruit flavour. Well hopped. Winner all around.  Cant wait to have it agin

1," Bottle (with a nice logo).  Aroma is slighly grassy and a litle flowery. Clear, golden coloured with a lasting, white head. Taste is sweet, has grassy hops, malts, bit flowery. Slightly thin. Okay.

1," Yes, very nice. Deserves more than my drunken brain can handle. Im not at at abeer festival, Im t home getting twatted with me mates. Cheers! Very good. Hope youre all in good health.
"
1," Pours dark and cloudy with visible floating yeast and a very decent head. Medium, malty aroma. Taste is of roasted malt, sweet and spicy, bit yeasty. Very little bitterness. Some coffee notes. Palate is medium bodied, high carbonation which makes it fizzy. A very decent Belgian Strong.
"
1," Pours dark brownish red with off white head from bottle.  Aroma has notes of nuts, slight chocolate, toffee, earth, caramel, some biscuit.  Taste is sweet sugar, nuts, toffee, chocolate, touch of earthy grass with a sweet caramel finish.  Easy to drink with enough flavor to back it up.
"
1," Pours with an amber body topped by a thick head with some lacing.  Its sweet and malty to start with a slight grapefruity hoppiness, then finishes bitter and piney from the hops.  Medium bodied, slightly dry and slightly tingly.
"
1," MAR 24, 2009 All I have to say is wow. My first Chimay. This Belgium beer is by far one of my favorites now. A strong fruity aroma that is a medium red and little to no head. This brew tingled, but was smooth and had just enough bitterness to let you know you were drinking a beer.
"
1," Pours a dark red/brown color with a towering head.  Spiced nose.  The taste was a good mix of rich malt and spice with a little bread.  I didnt think this was as bad as this site has sometimes made it out to be, but nor is it the worlds greatest.
"
1," Unclear dark brown, tanned non-homogenous head, all sizes of bubbles. Settles rapidly.		Some alcohol in aroma, some yeast, little fruit. Sweeter on the tongue, some chocolate. Nice balance.		Little alcohol feel. dry. 		 Medium body, fizzy.		 Probably good, but not really my style. Too sweet i guess, and i miss hop.		 Purchased in SuperBrugsen.
"
1," cask at brewery - Aroma of Belgian yeast, candi sugar, cherry, and bubblegum.  Pours hazy red with a small off white head and decent lacing.  Flavor matches aroma with the cherry turning sour.  The aftertaste is a little funky, but it works well and actually gives it character.  Palate is smooth and tart, but a little thin.  Not a bad dubbel, especially when you consider it was brewed in Noblesville, Indiana.
"
1," Bottled. Golden colour, slightly hazy, rich head. Buttery aroma, medium bodied with soft filling mouthfeel and very oily saaz hop flavour. Complex. Remarkably bitter finish.
"
1," Barman called this a starter ale. Draught  Pale yellow colour with a thin head.  Little lacing.  Light aroma, rather light a pale lager.  Light to medium body, Malty flavour.  Light bitter finish.
"
1," Beautiful maghogany red color, creamy foam with a very tiny bit of lace.  The taste starts off with a bang of earth, spice, rasins, and very nice bitter.  The taste fades to a lovely bitter ending.
"
1," Dark chestnut brown pour, bright edges.  Lasting crown.  Nose of candied plums and cherries lilts into soft toffee malts.  Somewhat intense, rather ordinary, and synthetic.  The malts carry a bit of seamist and campfire smoke character.  Subdued sweetness in pear skins and lemon sugars eventually overcomes a rough metallic edge.  Finishing taste of earthy pine nuts.  Very dry palate, in a cabernet sort of way.  Somehow uninspiring.
"
1," JAN 3, 2009 Pours a dark amber color with a full creamy head that lingers for a few minutes. Flavor is dried fruit, with a somewhat sweet, apricot finish.
"
1," Pours a burgandy color with a white forming head.  Great aroma of apricot and fruits.  Very pleasing to the mouth upon drink but finishes a little bubbly.  Great dubbel, great brew.  Thank you to the Monks of the Chimay team.
"
1," Draft in Jacksonville at Seven Bridges Brewing Co.  Dark black in glass, smooth taste; hearty palate.  Pretty good beer.  Would taste again.
"
1," Sweet malts in aroma.  The flavor is mild coffee, chocolate and smooth in texture.  Subtle in flavor, the coffee is the dominating flavor although not dominating, a very good all the way through.
"
1," I love it but I have tried it over and over and still think that the Rouge is better. Maybe a bit too fruity.
"
1," I was not too impressed with this beer but at least I have now tried a new beer style (keller bier). Unfiltered with notes of yeast.
"
1," nice head, no lace, very rich complex nose but, much smoother and softer in the mouth. Very mellow, nice carbonation, marshmallow, caramel, a bit of hop, lots of malt, some candy sugar. a beauty.
"
1," Poured a dark ruby/brown with a tan head. Good lacing on the glass.		Aroma could best be described as dark and heavy with a pronounced malty sweetness.		The flavor starts malty and sweet with a strong coffee flavor dominating. A long, coffee finish ends each drink.
"
1," Interesting perhaps. Dark for a premium lager. Opening the bottle is like being sprayed by a family of skunks.  Taste is mild with hops and carries a sweet, bread like malt taste. Not as offensive as I expected. I feel bad that the small store ordered like 9 million bottles of this, but has me wondering if there may be an Armenian community in my city..Sounds cool to me.
"
1," I really like Chimay Blue, but Ive recently come to realize that its much more of a gateway beer to Belgian awesomeness than it is a wonderful example of what is brewed there. Its perfect for introducing fizzy water fans to the world of real beer flavor.		Now that Ive tried many more Belgian ales (and especially other Trappist ales like Rochefort, Westmalle and Achel) I find Chimay Blue to be less than great when you compare against the benchmark they set. It touches your palate with a sense of excitement but it quickly dissipates. That makes it incredibly pleasant to drink, but dont expect to be wowed by flavor, aroma, maltiness or yeast while you devour this very drinkable ale. 		Its got a good balance of each, but that balance makes it less distinctive and memorable. A very good beer, but not one I will sell my soul for.
"
1," Cask at the Noblesville brewery - Aroma of oak, vanilla, summit hops and caramel malt.  Bourbon forward flavor.  Dry and woody with vanilla, caramel and chewy hops.  Palate is smooth, creamy and balanced.  If you like bourbon and hops mixed, this beer is for you.
"
1," Bottled.	Cloudy orange coloured with an off white head.	Aroma of medicine, fruits and malts.	Flavour of honey, medicine and fruits.	Weird beer.
"
1," Hazy dark amber with lots of residual yeast. Aromas of caramel, yeast, and a bit of spice. Mellow and reserved. Extremely smooth mouthfeel, spicy notes, and excellent malt backbone. A tad thin on the palate, but excellent despite.
"
1," (swing top bottle) Clear and dark mahogany colour with a short foamy off-white head. Citrus-fruity aroma with floral notes and only a tinge of toasted malts in the background. Light-sweet flavour, medium body, moderate carbonation. Slightly sweet toastmalty taste with strong notes of citrus fruits (grape fruits, bitter lemon), very light bitter, fruity and nutty finish with shy notes of coffee. Somewhat strange brew, because of its fruitiness, but anyway pretty drinkable.
"
1," I did the trifecta of Chimay this evening despite having had all three many times before...first time rating them. Small bottle. Pours a dark and murky copper with largeish head but it diminishes faster than the white or red. Nose is musky with hints of raisin and dough. Taste is out of this world...layered and sophisticated. Slightly sweet and yet evidently bitter. A roasted malt back reveals aspects of dusty roasted chestnuts with fruitcake and yeast. Finish has a hop bite that dances on the tongue. Slightly boozy but not offensive. Despite the youth of this bottle it offers everything I remember this beer for. In other words good young or aged. Top quality and my favorite of the Chimays.
"
1," Bottle from Getrnke Fritze, BergtheimBlond color. The aroma is light, with a very light earthy touch and traces of butter. The flavor is as well anonymous, with more traces of diacetyl. Boring.
"
1," Draft @ Cortez beer festival and at the brewpub. Is dark brown, a rich hue. Stable head. Aroma is huge malt character, rich dark bread, molasses-tinged pumpernickel. Smells like a good dunkel! The flavors are totally different, though, are more English mild in character. Has a smooth and creamy character, what malts are these? They are great, sort of like Malta but better. Body is just right, light, drinkable and super yum. Very well done!
"
1," Bottle 33 cl. Courtesy of fonefan. Clear yellow with a white head. Very sweet lemon/lime aroma. Medium body, extremely sweet lemon notes with a quinine like bitter finish. Odd. 280111
"
1," Orange coppery pour, off-white head.  Sweet malty mouth, with woody hops, but thin.  Moderate bitterness.  Definitely more of an English IPA than American.
"
1," fruit, malt, caramel, yeast. Taste"
1," 12oz pour pours a hazy brownish/amber color with minimal head. Aroma of nuts and mild roasted malts. The flavor is a little more intense in the nuttiness and you still have the back taste of the roasted malt. Overall not a bad beer.
"
1," Clear golden colored, foamy white head. Maize and grain aroma with creamy hints. Thin maizy flavor with a bit of hop. Not undrinkable, just not interesting at all.
"
1," Ruddy brown in color with a thin white head, looks quite effervescent in the glass.  Sweet malt and yeast aromas, some fig-like smells, but subdued.  Nice palate - very light and drinkable.  Rich sweet dark pit fruit tones play around in the taste but never overwhelm.  The finish is a bit dry and kind of simple.  Although I need to try the Blue again, I like this one better.
"
1," Beautiful copper amber pour with a generous tan head. Aromas of apricots. plums grapes and the signature Belgium yeast esters. It is essential to use a goblet, chalace or tulip for maximum enjoyment of its intricate aromas. The full flavors of this brew come alive slightly below  50 degrees. Tastes of dried fruits with  overtones of semisweet candied sugar. A hint of bitterness other than from the usual hop flavors. A well balanced solid choice anytime.
"
1," Muddy somewhat light brown, quickly settling head, medium homogenous bubbles.		 Light fruity aroma, apricot describes it well.		 Dry, a little bitter. Not very complex.		 Silky also describes it well. Fresh and fizzy, but smooth.		 Not very interesting.		 Purchased in Kihoskh.
"
1," One of the beers that introduced me to how complex a beer can be.		Tasted it on the weekend, just wasnt the same.  It was ok, but not like a few years ago when I tried it.  My guess is that this is the belgian most folks have when they first start to understand how good a beer can be.  There are too many beers out there better than this, but still a solid pick.

1," 12 oz bottle from Sahara Mart (Bloomington, IN), 5/18/09			Aroma"
1," This brew is a slightly hazy amber-orange color with a thin off-white head. Some lacing is evident. The aroma is light and wheaty. Light-bodied with equal parts hops and wheat in the flavor. This seems more like a light Lager than a Wheat. The finish is mildly hoppy. I can see this as being a gateway beer.

1," Glasflasche
"
1," Hazy pale straw color, medium head, little lacing. Aroma is raw wheat, mild orange, baking spices and vanilla... gingerbread like. Flavor is much the same, returning to that gingerbread character I noticed in the nose. There is some mildly tart citrus in there as well.  Finish is mildly floral/spicy noble hops. Mouthfeel is watery with a soft finish. This would be good in the summer if served slightly cold on a very hot day.
"
1," Draught (atlanta).  Red-brown color, medium head.  Aroma is good and malty.  Flavor is chocolate and caramel, well-balanced, and hoppy.  Hop flavor in aftertaste.  Easily the best one inthe Atlanta RB brew-pub.
"
1," A - Fruity, banana and bubblegum aroma	A - Cloudy brown with thin white head much like a strong glass of ice tea	T - Light sweet start with a controlled mild bitter finish	P - Full and soft	O - Cant argue with it being one of the worlds best. Reminds me of a  british bitter
"
1," JUL 26, 2008 The Chimay beers are quite magic, I dont know how else to put it. My impression is they were of even finer quality a number of years ago as well. Nonetheless, today theres still an ethereal other-worldly quality to them. A beer that instantly commands respect and exudes sophistication. Like a suave and confident statesman whos seen most everything, incorporated it into his consciousness and is all the wiser for it, this work of art exhibits tremendous balance, flavor and elegant restraint.  Poured into a trappist glass, 2007 bottle. Really packs a punch with me as well compared with all other 9% abv yet the intensity is beautifully blended quietly in the flavor. Medium head that reduces quickly but stays low for some time. Aroma says to you ""yes I have lots of complexity but dont need to show it off and bash you over the head with it"". Soft and warm mouthfeel, not as thick and chewy as many other strong ales Ive tried. Finish is relaxed and really sings. A truly excellent Belgian strong ale.
"
1," Cloudy reddish amber body with some light bubbles and an off-white frothy head. Head retention is decent at most.	Quite a complex fruity yeastiness in the nose, with a nice amount of caramel and brown sugar maltiness. Notes of cherry and plum.		The taste starts out with some moderate sweetness, followed by some bitterness and spices (cinnamon, clove). Notes of brown sugar, cherry and apple are quite apparent. The finish is just a bit bitter and bready with some lingering caramel notes.		The beer is medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation and some slight pepper-like burning sensation. Quite smooth too.		Pretty good drinkability for a Belgian dubbel. Chimay beers are great all in all, thats exactly why they are so popular amongst beer lovers and connoisseurs.
"
1," Big River Disney World-Winters Nip Porter(Gordon Biersch)-on tap-pours a tan head that dissipates, then laces.  Color is reddish/brown.  Aroma is coffee.  Taste is coffee with mild carbonation.  Not my taste.
"
1," Bottle at Chesters in Hamilton. Fresh bottle. Aroma was fruity and herbal. The beer itself was on the hazy side in terms of appearance. Darker than the likes of Chimay White. Taste was sweet with molasses and a very well balanced hint of alcohol. Tons of depth in flavour. Excellent brew.
"
1," This beer rocks! Pours as black as used motor oil. Medium-sized, creamy, beige head. Great retention and thick, creamy lacing.	Brown tea, charred wood, dark chocolate and cola in the aroma.	Very well-bittered to balance out the deeply roasted, chocolatey, full malt. Also, astringent with notes of charcoal.	Medium-bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Lengthy, burnt, crisp, dry finish. World class beer!
"
1," AUG 14, 2005 Dont taste the 9% ABV in here but bottom of the bottle will make you feel good "
1," Pours cloudy deep brown with a big dark tan head that dissapates.  Very carbonated.  Aroma of alchohol, dark fruits, bread and that wonderful belgian funky yeast.  Taste is pretty much the same with some raisin and prune.  Nice earthy, yeasty, bready finish.  Nice roasted malt background comes in at the end. The alchohol is strong at first but settles down as you drink.
"
1," Draft @ brewpub, in glass mug. Warm reddish brown with thick stable rocky head and splotchy lacing. Aroma of sweet bready malts and nice speculaas aromas. The flavors have nice spice in addition to the bread malts, adding to the speculaas character. Good quaffability and nice mineral character on the palate.
"
1," my favorite dubbel by a long shot.  caramel flavor balanced with hoppy bitterness.  highly recommended.
"
1," Would you believe I just had this at a Mexican restaurant here in Philly. Poured into a snifter the brew produced a nice creamy head. Smooth on the palate and flavorful throughout the sip.
"
1," pours rich gold with decent white head. aroma is malt forward with some nice spicy bitter hops, but not too intense. drinks the same with a nice malt backbone and a fair hop profile. decent session ipa
"
1," An excellent softly spicy, malty dubbel with a hint of citric bitterness. A good Belgian anyone can enjoy.
"
1," Had this beer on 3/5/2007.  Aroma is a sweet malty scent with faint sour tone in the back.  Color is deep dark amber with very active carbonation and thick tight head.  Taste is rich and sweet.  Starting with a full body it goes smooth with a rich creamy feel.  Finish comes on with a full sweet malt flavor and a nice fruity yeast taste then ends with a faint hop flavor and bitterness.  This is one of the most complex beers I know of.
"
1," Bottle courtesy of thirdeye11.  Light orange pour. A bit of hops on the aroma. Smell has a bit of BO to it. Taste is heavy on the hops with some musty hop taste as well. Interesting.
"
1," Pours a bit browner than ruby. Nice typical belgian head. Nose has that smell thats the same in the La Trappe beers; its like the taste of suger in the raw if you took away the sweetness. Maybe its from the sugar they use to start fermentation. Some very faint citric qualities to the smell with some other vague fruitiness. Im not sure how many people here have done this or have this weed, but chew on the bottom end of a stalk of Y grass (peel away the secondary leaves and chew on the white bottom). Its a flavor that very similar to one of those in this beer. Flavor it with a little bit of red grapes, minus the sweetness, with the faintest hint of alcohol and youve got the flavor nailed. The mouthfeel is actually fuzzy because of the way the carbonation is.

"
1," Hazy lemon yellow, excellent head and condition. Banana and plasticy phenol aromas, sweet in the mouth with a fruity banana note and a dry chalky finish with plastic burps.
"
1," Pitch black, but clear with thin camel head.  Like drinking a latte -- very, very smooth stout with low carbonation.  Lots of chocolate and lactose flavors.  Medium finish and creamy mouthfeel.  This is very impressive without being terribly complex.  This started out with damn good malt and didn't overdo the dark, patent malts.
"
1," Dark brown with a thick baige head. Aroma is very fruity and a little spicy. Flavor of darkfruits and honneycake, almost no bitterness. Extremly smooth palate and a warming finish. My friends two year old boy took a zip and wanted more, thats a sign of a quality brew!
"
1," Havent had a bottle of this since I joined RateBeer, so I thought I would revisit it. 750 ml bottle. Deep ruby tinged amber presents a fizzy, loosely structured off white head that settles quickly leaving little lace. LIght fruity aroma with some notes of yeast and spice. Medium body with lively carbonation and a soft creamy texture. Moderately sweet, with balnce provided by some peppery hop bitterness.
"
1," The head is huge and it has a copper colour, the head doesnt last long though. The aroma is hoppy and it has a bit of spicies and yeast. Flavor is full of yeast with a bitter touch.
"
1," Nice beer. bottle from Glenville beverage. Served 50 degrees in a tulip glass. Pours a dark, cloudy yellow. Huge, thick white head. Nice Brussels lacing. Smells of hops and yeast. Taste is definetly hoppy and a little yeast, maybe a little raisin. Nice beer. Ill get it again.
"
1," Drank on tap (20 oz) at there brewpub, on August 6, 2010. Honey orange, thin head. Small aroma of pale malt, light hoppy notes of peaches. Taste of pale malt, notes of herbs and tart fruit, slightly bitter aftertaste. Another beer that makes you curse!
"
1," Cask@GBBF 2009. 	Amber color, small white head. Aroma of calvados and raisins. Flavor is similar, raisins, some alcohol, woody hops. Quite nice beer to sip. Well-balanced winter warmer.
"
1," The pour is a fine reddish brown, with ample creamy head.  The nose is fruits, yeast, nuts and other fine scents.  The flavor is typically Chimay, smooth, slightly floral with hints of citrus.  Another  good beer.
"
1," Amber color. Grapefruity hop nose.Flavor has a long finish, but not particularly strong.
"
1," Since this is widely available in Chattanooga, Ive spent the money to try it several times and I still think its overrated -- especially compared to other great beers in the style.  Nice fruity aroma and flavor with warming alcohol, but way too sweet and not very comlex.
"
1," bottle shared with me by The_Captain. thanks Mark. pours a hazy golden color with a large white head composed of very fine bubbles. smells very fruity with notes of pear, apple, and grapes. flavor is very yeasty with the aforementioned fruit notes also present. light spice is present and bit of hop bitterness ties it all together nicely. a lovely beer but possibly my least favorite from Chimay.
"
1," This is a nice bit of variety, but it doesnt live up to the two greats of blue and white.  Certainly well worth the drink though.
"
1," clear brown, smooth white head.	aroma of spices, honey-cookies, faint sweet malts, caramel. Quite spicy, but still not cloying aroma. cinnammon	flavor is spicty, cinnammon, cookies, faint malty.
"
1," Bottle. Medium head with medium duration. Color is golden. Aroma is sweet malt and some caramel. Taste is malty and very smooth.
"
1," Wow, this is a real Belgian!  Aroma is plums and apricots ..lots of sweetness.  The mouthfeel is great, perfect carbonation and body...not too heavy.    Tastes of bread and toffee prevail.  This is a sneaker...the 9% is well hidden as others have said, but it creeps up on you.  Wow, this is a terrific brew
"
1,"	Honeyed and highly floral, zesty, citrusy tripel with a strong aromatic component, but tolerable bitterness.		I like"
1," Green bottle. Dark yellow. Big bubbled head. Aroma does start out a little off but then settles into a trong straw and vegetable nose. Attractive sweet body and strong hop flavour. Better than expected from country #73.
"
1," Hazy, cloudy, orangish-brown.  Oily, off-white head.  Aroma is of bananas, brown sugar, raisin bagels, cloves, coriander and cinnamon.  Flavors are similar to aroma, with Belgian yeast, caramel sweetness, vanilla, toffee and cloves being the most prominent.  Effervescent.  Clean sweeping finish.  Peppery aftertaste.  Nicely done.
"
1," Chimay Rouge pours a sedimented, dark amber with a fluffy, off white head. Rouge carries a fruity yeast aroma with some hints of the malt. Flavors include a spicy malt, a berry-like fruitiness, and a nice bitter finish.
"
1," Dark reddish brown, big and foamy beige head. Peppery yeasty nose, slight syrupy fruits and cheese. Flavor is dried fruits, malts and yeast. Spicy, well hopped and peppery finish, little earth also. Medium bodied, smooth but hollow palate. Its got that basic Chimay pepperiness.
"
1," Bottle. Dark brown colour with a beige head. Aroma is roasted malt, spices, caramel. Flavour is alchohol, roasted, fruit, apple, cellar notes, caramel.
"
1," nice subtle aromas, of burnt sugary oatmeal and light bourbon barrel .. . good lacing, decent head and all that .. a simple brew, easy to drink.. nice stuff.. but an average bourbon version brew, as weird as that sounds... You dont win friends with salad ..
"
1," Bottle. High white and lasting head.  Clear golden body. Sour grapefuit like aroma.  Dry hops bitterness and not the expected sweetness. Amazed about the low ratings. Nothing special but on the other hand not bad.
"
1," Bottle from Quack-Duck. Pale golden color. Bready aroma with hints of pear. Malty bready flavor with floral notes and lots of apple and pear. Residual sugars. Decent festbier.
"
1," 750 ml	  Hazy dark amber with a nice soapy head. Lt. hops with a green spice flavor reminiscent of cloves. Better than the White, but not as good as the Blue.
"
1," Very dark brown color. Rich fruity smell.  Flavor is strong, with a little too much alcohol for my taste. I tend to prefer the Red, but I think I in the minority.
"
1," Pours amber red, very cloudy. Yeasty spicy aroma. Strong carbonation, faint hops, restrained malt sweetness, strong yeast presence, citrus zest residual spiciness. Delicious!
"
1," This is simply one of the best beers in the world that everyone shouldve tried. The dark colour, with the amber touch, great strong head that doesnt dissapear and the great aroma is only the startup to a great beer experience. Its a beer to combine with a nice steak or Belgium stew, or to drink on its own in the evening with some cheese. Its a heavy bittersweet taste, with a smooth aftertaste. One of the better abbey beers.
"
1," Pours a brown-red-orange colour with a creamy tanned head. There seems to be a cascade effect of small beige sediments, coming from the head, on down. Not as much retention as I thought it would be, and hardly any lace. Spices and Belgian yeast aromas, but lighter then Unibroues competition. Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Smooth nutty start with some mild bitterness and a clean aftertaste. Some spices, but flavour is not overpowering, quite light actually. Found some fruit as well, like some pear and slight apple. Expected more from this brew, but still a very good start for someone who has not tried a trappist beer. Still, the white cap is my favorite of the Chimays.
"
1," JUL 4, 2006 700mL Bottle. First off I love the fact that this bottle had a cork in it. Poured a deep red-brown, slightly cloudy with a thick white head. Aroma of sweet honey and plums. It was well carbonated. Taste starts sweet with fruits and carmels, lots of grains, and yeast flavour with a hint of carmels and finishes with a slightly dry bitterness. Another nice product of Belguim.
"
1," Atlanta.  On tap at Rock Bottom Restaurant and Brewery in Buckhead.  I up my scores on this a bit to compensate for the fact that I already dont like IPAs.  Really, really bitter hops that are even stronger and more ""aggresive"" (to quote the commercial description) than the pale ale at this brewery or many other IPAs.  The only one Id say I disliked more was the Flying Dog IPA.  Both are not that fun to drink, unless you like that kind of beer.
"
1," Draft at Chattanooga location. Golden in the glass with a white head. The aroma was subdued but a light citrus and grain was detected. The flavor was of wheat and citrus. Light body and watery.
"
1," Dark pour from bottle.  Excellent balance of malt, hops, and light fruit taste.  Medium abv, goes great with a nice steak.  Typical strong offering from the folks at Chimay.  Excellent!
"
1," This is truly a beautiful beer, with a powerful malt background.  Seriously this is like a fine wine and can be aged as such, and as amazing complexity.  With a flavor that evolves from one sip to the next, a cookie dough maltiness, with an amazing mouithfeel.  Sweet toffee and coffee flavorsm, and a subtle candi sugar fruitiness.  This is truly a lovely beer.
"
1," Hazed garnet hue, frothy cap that holds a real Brussels lace and holds it to the end of the glass.		Smells of bread pudding with a hint of medicinal clove, . Sweet raw honey-like malt aroma. Starts very smooth and silky with a rolling viscous carbonation that plows though peppering the tongue with ginger-clove tastes and malty sweetness with a hint of birch. The finish is rather dry with a fascinating herbal sweetness left on the tongue. This is an abbey beer fit for serving with a rich meal.
"
1," Drank this on June 2, 2007.  The aroma was of red wine. The head was creamy, light brown, good lacing and mostly diminishing. The body was clear and the color a dark amber. The initial flavor was a light sweet, light acidic and a light bitter. The finish was average.
"
1," De basic beer from Chimay. Light brown color with a large white head. Aroma is yeasty and malty. Flavor is very much the same with a bit of fruityness to it. 	OKAY.
"
1," clear amber with a decent but fairly loose white head that settles into a thin film quickly. aroma grapefruit and light pine. bittersweet grapefruit and pine flavor with light nutty notes. dry bitter grapefruit finish. medium body. moderate carbonation. not bad but not that great.
"
1," Dark brown body with a noisy 1 cap and the custom made bottle with the road killed frog cast into the side is a nice touch. Nutty chocolaty aroma with some sour soap and just a touch of fine ground coffee. Very rich malty taste with roasted elements more light chocolate and coffee with a mild dry bitter finish. Noticing a mild hop bite. This is a good beer I was pleasantly surprised.
"
1," Draft... GABF 06... Pitch black ale with a small, creamy, brown head. Excellent retention. Mostly coffee in the nose, but plenty of chocolate as well. Lots of burnt, tangy coffee grounds in the flavor along with some dark chocolate. Almost medium-bodied and lightly oily with fizzy carbonation. Finishes roasty and mildly bitter.
"
1," Bottle from Beers of Europe. Sour grassy aroma, Very dark cloudy brown. Smooth caramel biscuit flavour with sweet aftertaste. A quality beer but not really my thing.
"
1," dark brown color.  smell of raisins and brown sugar and spices.  not much to the taste.  it does have an alcohol burn but you can't taste it in the beer.
"
1," Less than overpowering aroma of sweet malt and brown sugar. Poured a dark brown with a tiny head and some lace. Very sweet, slightly toasty and only the faintest hopping. Poor carbonation but a good body. Drinkable, but only if nothing else is available.
"
1," Small Bottle.  Pours a hazy reddish brown with an absolutely massive head that fills the glass.  Aroma is sweat, fruity, and wheaty with hints of caramel and honey.  Flavor is malty sweat with hints of honey, plums, and grapes.  This beer has a nice initial bite but little if any bitterness.  Finish is smooth with a pleasant alcoholic warmth.  Light to medium bodied consistency with a light and bubbly mouth feel.  A top notch Belgian Strong.
"
1," malty, citrus, leather, fresh hop and a little baked bread. Flavors about the same. Good body and carbonation. Bitter pistachio fininish.
"
1," Surprisingly rich and full-flavored after sampling some of their other light/appease-the-masses offerings. Rich malty, roasty aroma. Velvety body thanks to oatmeal, very good balance of malt, roastiness and hop. Nice full body. Keep this one, kick up the Blind Tiger( a quite good, but underdone offering) and scrap everything else on the regular tap. You are in a great location - quit pandering to the masses. Make more beers like this and people will find them on reputation.
"
1," Big Bottle.  Sediment rich, dark brown color - opaque even when held to the light.  Nice, frothy beige head that dissapates moderatly fast, Aroma of bananas.  Nice mouthfeel - full, rich and bubbly, leaves a nice alcohol warmness in the back of the throat.   Theres almost an astringent quality, my tongue sizzles from the carbonation, similar to drinking mineral water.  I really like that.  The flavor is pleasing.  Malty, a bit fruity but not dominated by citrus, as many other brews are.  Good stuff!
"
1," Very amber pour.....sweet, fruity hints on the nose. Very sweet flavor....plums, raisins, caramel malts. A great beer to sip slightly below room temperature.
"
1," Pours very dark in color. Aroma is a little sweet. A yeasty, wheat like aroma. Tastes alot like a hefeweizen to me. Just a strong one. Has slight roasty spicy flavor. A little alcohol is present. After about half of the bottle alot of rich dark fruit flavors and spice really seemed to come out. Consumed at room temp.
"
1," A pale gold pour with a thin, soapy-looking head.  The aroma has notes of straw, light grain, and a mild earthiness.  The light body is as thin as water with soft carbonation.  The taste is bland and flavorless.
"
1," Bottled (BB 12/2009)	Thanks Bjrn!	Hazy yellow, small white head. Sweet wheaty, banana aroma. Banana, sweet candy, a bit grainy. Decent weizen.
"
1," 750 ml bottle	I picked this up at a white elephant exchange around the holidays.  For whatever reason Ive been overlooking it until now.  I cant imagine why as it is one of the best beers I have had the chance to sample.  The only hard thing about it will hanging onto another bottle for three years to age it again.  The cork on this bottle said 08/03.	Aroma / Appearance - The half finger tan head danced over the top of the bronze body creating a beautiful scene.  A reddish tint gave it some more life.  The creamy nose consisted of caramel, chocolate, anise and black cherry.  A hint of fruits floated above it all creating a very dense and complex combination of scents.  I could smell this one for a while without ever taking a sip.	Flavor / Palate - The first sip unveiled a chewy rich tapestry of flavors.  Opening with cherries, chocolate and raspberry sorbet, it then morphs into black pepper and vanilla.  It is not quite on par with St Bernadus or Rochefort but it is so close that I would never turn it down.  The alcohol has a certain prescence that is evident but never threatens to overwhelm the palate.  For an almost four year old beer this had held up exceptionally well.  I wonder how long it would last.
"
1," Draft.  As a die hard fan of Newcastle, I had some expectations with this beer, and it did not meet them.  Very average at best, and not as good as some other brown ales I have tried.  Much room for improvement with this one.
"
1," Another fine Chimay product.  Smooth bubbly palate that always reminds me of champagne.  Ages well, or so I am told ;)
"
1," Bottle thanks to thirdeye11. The color of the beer is brown and it has a beige colored head.  The smell is hops, fresh hops, fruits, malts, and alcohol.  The  taste is hops, fruits, and ok.
"
1," 750 ml. bottle.  Pours a very dark red-brown with beige / tan head which never quite disappears.  Sweet floral aroma, not of hops but of sweet flowers like honeysuckle, delicate and subtle, yeast detectable, honey, dark fruits.  More fruits detectable once tasted, plum, raisin, grape, blackberry.  Finish is somewhat dry however, with Belgian spices noticeable.  Very nice, though I prefer St. Bernardus Abt. 12; chimay is a little overpriced, maybe due to its popularity?
"
1," Bottle, pours a reddish chestnut with a wispy head.  Nose is belgian yeast, light figs, some chestnuts.  Kind of underwhelming.  Flavor is at first too bitter with a long, bitter finish, faintly cola-like.  As it warms some nice creaminess comes through, with some raisins and figs.  Decent, but too watery.  Heavily carbonated.  Some of the fine nuances are there, but this is just a large step down from the Grand Reserve, and is watery compared to some of the better dubbels out there.
"
1," One of the first belgian beers that Ive had, and after trying many others, I was glad to have it again recently and find that I still like it as much as I remembered. Cant say that for all my old favorites. Draft pour that was golden with a white one inch head. This beer is very good cold, and also as it warms.Nice mouthful, with hints of spices and fruit. Nicely carbonated.Hoppy nice with a slightly sweet finish. Great with a nice blue cheese burger.
"
1," Cloudy orange amber pour with a thin white head. Solid aroma of citrusy, piney hops and caramel.  Very good flavor of piney, citrusy hops with caramel and a good dose of malt. In the end, the bitterness is strong and lasting. The body is medium with a creamy texture and medium carbonation. Nicely done.
"
1," espuma de aparncia inicial portentosa e cremosa, colorao marrom-claro e curta longevidade. Seu corpo apresentou tons marrom-claros, densidade mdia, turbidez e moderada formao de colarinho. No aroma, farejei algumas coisas que no esperava, como a suave presena de caf, notas ctricas lembrando lima, bala toffee e frutas vermelhas - a bela complexidade de uma BSA. No campo do sabor, o incio foi permeado por leves dulor e amargor, sensaes estas que foram suplantadas por moderado amargor no final, este de curta durao. Percebi ainda um marcante toque de frutas secas no paladar, o que aumentou sobremaneira o charme dessa deliciosa cerveja. No paladar, fui premiado com um corpo mdio-cheio, de textura oleosa, forte carbonatao e forte final metlico
"
1," Jimmack 07.  375 ml bottle.  Pours a light golden, still, decent legs.  Aroma is fresh pressed apple cider, apple sauce, syrupy sweet hints of maple and green apple skin.  Sugary and syrupy sweet upfront with almost a sharp prickly sweetness on the sides of the tongue- hints of honey, green apple tartness, and some apple skin slight astringency at the end but still really smooth.  Really nice overall.  I might like this one a little better than the Niege.
"
1," majestic foamy head, deep coffee color, intense carbonation.  yeasty/malty sweet aroma.  roasted malt is the first thing i taste, but it gives way to a floral and spicy tang with a lot of bitterness (although that might just be the alcohol; 9% is strong).  very smooth and spicy on the palate, finishes dry.  the head was still there when i finished the glass!  awesome beer.
"
1," probably a bit stale but i couldn't find the use-by date. oddly hazy, tasted of weet bix in flat lemonade. not that bad
"
1," 07 Bottling. Dark ryby brown, slowly vanishing beige head. Nose is sweet malty with warm spiciness and cooked, sweet roots? Without yeast, the flavor is bitingly bitter, dry and spicy with a hint of dark fruits. Pitching in the sediment smoothens the dryness and brings a more sweeter and fuller, a bit peppery finish. Even slight hop aroma too. Full bodied, small bubbled and foamy carbonation. Alcohol well hidden. 50-50% mix of this and the drier white one would be the perfect Chimay.
"
1," bottle -  red brown beer with a beige head. Aroma of fruits and yeast. A beer full with flavour. Hints of grapes and wood, roasted malt and alcohol.
"
1," Opaque dark red-brown color with thick tan head. Aroma is subtle...sweet, a little winey... a bit of fruit. Taste is mellow, sweet, with a lingering tartness. A good beer. I gave a higher Overall rating because this beer has a special place in my heart. I lost my Belgian-beer virginity to this beer back in the early 90s. It was my first clue that there was more out there.
"
1," 330 mL bottle.  A classic.  Brown colour with a lasting thin head.  Dried fruit and caramel.  Alcohol that doesnt ruin the palate.  Pleasant bitterness. Best of the Red, White and Blue trio we tasted.
"
1," Pours a nice dark brown cola color with a nice big head of foam.		Aroma is nicely that of a good Trappist.  Reminds of a Rochefort 10.		Interesting flavor.  Very mild for a beer, nice and yeasty with roasted malt.  Subtle.  Not what I expected, considering the high standing of this beer.
"
1," Bottle, aged about two years.  Finally got around to rating these.  Pours a crimson tinged brown, slightly hazy, with a medium to large beiged off white head that falls quickly.  Deep old caramel and dark plum notes, with a bit of bright fruit.  Toast, smooth malt, simple but clean.  Chewy toffee, and bright lively carbonation.  Finishes up with some nice bright malt and a nice bit of toast.
"
1," (bottle) Cloudy and hazy dark amber colour with a huge fluffy off-white head. Most of all yeasty and clovy aroma with a shy fruity note of citrus. Soft sweet malty taste, light notes of caramel, fruity and spicy palate, slightly tart and sour, slim and quite short fruity and malty finish.
"
1," 33 cL bottle. Pours dark brown with a light orange glare and a small off-white head. Spiced hoppy and roasted malt aroma. Roasted malt flavoured, light metallic note. Roasted malty finish, quite dry and with a minor spice into the finish.
"
1," This beer is absolutely beautiful.  I love Abbey-style ales most of all and this is easily among my favorites.  It is quite beautiful to behold when poured in the glass, the bouqet is magnificent, it goes down smoothly and easily, and the taste is that of a complex dark ale with wonderful hints of fruitiness.  		I am not a beer snob - I have been known to enjoy an Olde English 800 and a Pabst Blue Ribbon on occasion.  There are certainly beers that top even this, but if you are looking for a reason why beer should be taken as seriously as wine, this is it.
"
1," 750 ml bottle...Pours a deep brown w/ an nice, fizzy head. Aromas of dark fruits, yeast, and some malt. Good mixture of flavors including the aforementioned dark fruits, and sweet yeast, plus some alcohol and spice. very easy to drink even though it is 9%. A must have...
"
1," Finally get a chance to do the notorious red. Bottle at the Hop House in Carnegie for $6.50. Very sparkley appearance. Hazy light brown. Good clean near candy aroma.  Taste is rather strong and it doesnt hide its alky content well. Very good creamy bubbly carbonation on the palate. Not as refined as many other belgie dubs Ive had. Acceptable, none the less. Finish is a little coarse and difficult at times, somewhat like a strong ale.
"
1," Not as dark as I had expected. Finishes warm down the throat with a very noticeable alcohol aftertaste. Much like drinking bourbon straight, without as much bite. Not quite my cup of tea, but not bad. Worth trying if you get the chance.

1," Clear color, nose is sweet with light koji and grainy notes, a bit of alcohol. The flavor is nutty and a bit acidic and harsh but not completely bad. Moderate alcohol, harsh koji and a noticed lack of fruity melon characteristics and a buttery mouthfeel. Decent, but not that great. the line between the two is large.

1," Bottle (12oz).  Shared with blankboy, biegaman and tupalev - blankboys bottle.  Deep ruby-brown, small frothy off-white head.  Sweet roasty aroma, very light hops.  Malty, bitter and roasty - long bitter finish.  Slick astringent body, fairly flat, carbonized.  Good, not great - a little too burnt for a ""sweet"" stout.
"
1," Big frothy head.  Fruity aroma.  good carbanation.  Very yeasty with fruit flavors.  Very clean on the palate.  good beer but it's pricey.  I won't spend the money again.
"
1," JAN 5, 2009 good palate and aroma. dark dark beer. i expected it to be thick and creamy, but was surprised by the light and crispness. no tracing or head. flavor was sharp, but not bitter, and smooth throughout.  taste of grapes floating around. almost like a wine-beer, if that makes any sense.
"
1," Ecellent combination of bouquet and complex taste invites the drinker to pair the ale with a variety of foods especially spicy sausages and other hearty foods of Germanic origin.
"
1," Pours a murky amber - brown. The aroma is fruit and yeast - raisin, peach, and apple. Quite light bodied, perfect creamy carbonation, very fruity, slightly bitter finish, very drinkable. No where near the complexity of the Blue or White, but a delicious and classic beer. A great trappist dubbel.
"
1," Malty, slight alcohol nose.  Dark copper body with big off white head that dissapears fast and slightly cloudy.  Malty almost whiskey taste.  Strong alcohol taste that finishes sweet.  Rather balanced flavors
"
1," FEB 24, 2009 Seemed cheaply made or that some concessions had been made. A little thin, but fairly smooth. Nice fruity (kiwi & citrus) zest. Pretty good malty profile with a little bit of everything. Caramel, molasses, a bit chocolaty, brown sugar, slightly nutty. Nice finish. 7/4/7/3/14-3.5 on 6/11/08 from 750mL.		750mL on 2/23/09. Aroma is very fruity. (Add strawberry) Palate is nicely crisp and dry, which previously  had come across as thin. Finish is still somewhat fruity with some esters floating around and nice nutty brownness. Nice unique bitterness at the start of the finish (earthy, woody hops with a tang?). 7/4/8/4/15-3.8
"
1," 33 cl bottle. Hazy amber liquid with medium off-white head. Malty aroma with notes of dark fruits, caramel, toffee, belgo yeast, banana, cloves. Quite sweet aroma. Taste is bicuity and malty with medium to high bitterness for the style and light sweetness. Notes of dark fruits and some spices. A bit astringent. Quite boozy. Medium bodied with OK carbonation and sticky mouthfeel. Overall, OK belgo ale but not in the same class as the other belgian trappists.
"
1," sample from the pitcher @ GABF on 9/18/10.  dark black pour with a 1 finger tan head.  sweet malts aromas.  medium body with light malts.  roasted finish with some dark fruits.  overall a very sweet baltic porter and a bit off IMO.
"
1," The smell has soo much chocolate. It smells great. I want to smell it over and over. the malts are great. Not a lot of head or lacing, a bit clearish too. The chocolate is great, and theres this weird mint thing that sort of subtly happens. You could miss it if the beer were too cold or you werent quite paying attention, but it is there. that chocolate flavour lasts though. If anyone from the dead frog brewery is reading this you should flesh out the chocolate, maybe add some  cayenne pepper and forget that silly mint shit. Beer isnt a desert, its the whole damn meal!
"
1," Bottle. Dark brown with large white head. Sweet, caramel, malt. Low on hops. Alcoholic but not owerpowering despite 9 % abv. Godd, lasting beer that you cant have too many of due to the alcohol but very nice after dinner.
"
1," Big bottle. A dark amber color with highlights of chocolate. Nice tan head with great retention and carbonation. The aroma is complex with notes of dried apricot, chocolate, spice and earthy character. Some off notes include cardboard which I attribute to oxidation, maybe very old? The taste is a bit dull with some notes of figs, cocoa and spruce. Not bad but not stellar either.
"
1," OCT 15, 2009 This was surprisingly good.  Its dark gold with a medium, dense off-white head that slowly shrinks and leaves a little lacing.  The aroma is a strong, pungent pale lager aroma first of sweet grain & malt, then flowery pine, leaves, with hints of crackers and a typical light hint of skunk.  The taste is also a strong pale lager taste, with a sweetish malty start then a faintly meaty, pungent pine-herbal-grass hop taste and bitterness that really dominates the drink for the rest of the time and is quite nice.  After a while, as it warms a bit, there is a faint soapy metallic quality, but this is not noticeable if one drinks it cold or does not linger on it, instead letting the sharp herbally hops dominate.  The body becomes a little watery as it warms.  In the end, it is quite good.  It goes well with food.
"
1," Ive aged this 75 cl bottle for about four years. Carmelly and toffee aromas of maltiness. Clear deep brown color with a minimalist whitish head. Starts with malty sweetness underlaid by a woodiness. Thin to medium mouthfeel, mild carbonation, with berry popping up towards the finish. Woody oaky mildly hoppy finish. Dry but not astringent. Very - yes - very.
"
1," the beer poured a dark brown with a nice thick head with ayeasty and slightly hopy nose. the beer is good but boring.
"
1," the bottle had a huge loud pop when i corked it, but no gusher;  sweet!  it pours pale oarnge leaving a thin tan head that fell rather on the quick side, with a body of deep ruby color with a good amount of bubbles rising up. its kind of cloudy too.  nice thin lacing in the glass and leaves a super thin head when it eventually fell.  it really does smell of yeast and toffee.  roasted malts are present in the nose along with a sweet fruity scent that i can not put my finger on, or possibly some coco?  it has a nice mouthfeel to it, not to over carbonated, very malty with touches of a sweet caramel roasted malt.  not bitter at all and has a really nice aftertaste that lingers along for a little while after it finishes.  there is also some hints of a dry red wine on the sides and my upper palate which has a nice ""zing"" to it.  awsome brew, i really do have to admit.
"
1," 750 mL bottle.  Pours hazy brown with a light tan head.  Aromas mainly of dark fruits, red grapes and raisin.  Flavors of raisin, cherry, nuts, a bit of yeasty green apple, and a pleasant touch of alcohol.  An excellent dubbel.
"
1," Great trappist ! Dark colour.	Aroma is moderatly malty, slightly hoppy and lightly doughy. Flavor is a almost perfect balance of sweet and bitter with a short finish. Medium bodied creamy, livley with a slightly chalky finish. +++
"
1," Tap.  Dark roasted malt, coffee, creamy chocolate aromas with a faint hop nose.  Pours opaque with a tan head and spotty lacing.  Dry roasted malt with dark chocolate and toffee body.  Dark, medium bodied and a little thin palate.

1," 33 cl bottle @ Lasse Autios Herrgrd, Ropns, Vasa. Rated on 27.9.2008	Aroma has some banana, aged fruits, yeast and spices. Flavour is richly grainy and has some sweetish malt. Good dubbel but still I see no reason to buy it again.
"
1," This is the best beer Ive ever had.  Bottom line.  Excellent flavor with an unexpected sweetness, all without being overally strong.  Have to read the alc. content to believe it!
"
1," Compared the Blue with the Koningshoeven Quad the other night, and I must say they are two very different animals. The Koeningshoeven is more in your face with its caramel-candi-sugar nose, and the alcohol is slightly more prevalent, while the Chimay is a thing of subtlety and all about being Belgian with apple, pear, and white grapes dancing on your palate. That being said, I notice I still have identical scores all the way down the line. Hmm.
"
1," Not as good as I remembered it. I could taste the cork for one thing. Head insignificant. Color, cloudy, medium brown. Very yeasty. Sour finish. Vinous and earthy, some fruitiness, but mouthfeel is thin and overall flavor not particularly  complex. Maybe not the freshest bottle...
"
1," AUG 23, 2009 Dark murky brown, thin head. Strong malty aroma. Very carbonated (overcarbonated even). Tasty dark malts - plums, raisins. Alcohol is fairly well hidden. Yeasty. Slight impression of roasted nuts.
"
1," AUG 1, 2011 A true work of art!  Goblet, on draft.  Golden pour under an off-white head.  Subtle hops behind a thick, sweet, sticky palate.  And flavor that kept building, sip after sip.  Was still tasting it long after, and thats a good thing!  My first foray into that kind of top-shelf offering, quite impressed!
"
1," excellent reddish brown hazy color and a very nice inch head Mostly diminishing. A very enjoyable earthy / fruity taste. a must try for any new beer tasters
"
1," Had a few of these  bombers on the drive to work today. Seriously though a nice burgundy color with a fluffy whity pillow like head that never realy settles down.  Cabonation jumping like champagne which acentuates the fruity nose.  Always a pleasure knowing some is in the cellar.
"
1," Not as well balanced as the others in the mix.  I got it the day after they opened the tap and it still needed just a bit more time to open up.  It had great texture and color.  Not a strong nose on the beer.  Decent, but not my favorite.
"
1," 22 oz extra in a trade with Sprinkle.  Not a lot of bourbon, but some wood in the aroma.  More wood in the flavor, Some dark roasty notes as well.  Not too bad.
"
1," light flower aroma,dark amber, cloudy, light brown foam, light sweetness, lightly bitter, medium body, creamy, soft carbonation, long finish,

1," Tasted from a 500 mL bottle puchased in Aurora, Colorado. Golden pale yellow appearance. Skunky pale lager aroma. Skunky pale lager flavor.  Bitter flavor and finish. Pretty gross.
"
1," Along with Diamond Knot and Bhagwans, this is the third member of my IPA Holy Trinity.  Huge citrus flavours, appetizing bitterness, trance-inducing aromas...oh man....just thinking about this beer...oh lord.  Excuse me, I need to go to the fridge now.
"
1," Bottle, thanks ekstedt. Dark reddish brown with off-white head. Fruity aroma of raisins. Sweetish taste. Full mouthfeel with fizzy carbonation.
"
1," 12oz bottle from StFun - thanks, Josh!!! Base beer for the Black Majic, apparently, and a nice one to try. First warm day of a Carolina spring and I want a roasty oatmeal stout? Eh, whatever. At any rate, I found it pleasant and unassuming. The nose is somewhat modest, decent roasted notes and a hint of creamy chocolate. Fizzy body is a bit of a surprise, given the style, and indeed its just a touch too thin for me. Nicely chalky finish, just like the coffee cousin. But the flavor profiles not nearly as complex as Id like it to be, even for a style made to session. Enjoyable even so, and big ups to Josh for giving me a chance to taste this.
"
1," Fredagsbaren p Biologi, Aarhus	Bottled	Strong with alcohol warmness	Complex of malt and brown sugar	Blanced bitterness
"
1," Bottle 33. Brow dark colour with a nice head. Nice malt flavour, complex and sweet body, yeast has a nice fruit aroma which is very present. All aroma are smelling better once the beer is going heater. Greate trappist beer ever.
"
1," Copper red color. Substantial head. Fruitiness and spice more apparent as it warms. Slight bitter finish.
"
1," It is really an easy to drink beer with a taste that seems like brown sugar. It tastes good on the mouth and it is very smooth to drink. Very nice flavor but not lasting. Good and steady head and an hazy brown color in the body.
"
1," Bomber.  Pours an extremely dark mahogany brown to virtually black color.  A frothy, dark khaki colored head settles slowly to a thin layer with a prominent edge.  Random spotting marks the glass.  Aromas include burnt caramel, chocolate fudge, mocha, vanilla, and faint hints of bourbon.  It is mostly sweet smelling, with traces of earthy hops lending just a hint of bitterness.  The bourbon is very subtle, almost unnoticeable at first, eventually folding into the brew quite nicely.  Flavors follow suit, sweet cocoa and scorched caramel leading the charge, with oaky vanilla, earthy spice, and traces of sour mash bourbon to follow.  The mouthfeel is medium-full and somewhat syrupy, its substance coming mostly from the sugar profile.  Still, it never gets cloying or overly sticky.  This is not a bad brew at all.  Its a pretty solid stout, although a bit too sweet perhaps, that has been subtly kissed by the oak bourbon barrel.
"
1," A little bready/grainy flavor to it, mostly a macro lager taste to it, although not too bad, probably because it isnt nasty.
"
1," Cloudy reddish brown with off white head.  Aroma of brown sugar and raisins.  Woody flavor with dried fruits.  Good flavor of fruits  and sugar.  Just a bit of bitterness.  Overall a very nice trappist ale.
"
1," Bottled. A golden cider. The aroma has notes of concentrated apple juice and alcohol. The flavor is sweet with notes of alcohol, apples, and some sirup, leading to a dry alcoholic finish. Thanks yespr for sharing.

1," pous hazy amber. lots of carbination, light head that quickly settles.  Yeasty aroma. yeast upfrony slight malt finish. decent ale
"
1, Pours a dark caramel brown with hints of golden amber. Has a 1-2 finger off-white foamy head which dissipates fairly quickly. Minimal lacing.		Smell
1," Outstanding. Without question, one of the best beers I have ever tasted. Creamy head, reddish coloring. Extraordinarily fruity/flowery taste with hints of berries and slight bitterness...complex flavors without being too ""heavy."" Excellent finish and aftertaste...reminiscent of cloves. Temperature variations seem to have negligable effect on qualities of drink. Unbelieveable!
"
1," MAR 19, 2011 pours a deep purplish brown with a thin white head and no lacing.  Deep, dark fruit aroma with notes of leather, plum, currants and yeast.  complex and beautiful, the way a great beer should be.  Taste is caramel, some hops and malty sweetness.  finishes primarily with the yeast.  A truly great beer!
"
1," TheDM and Hotstuff vacation brew 75.  This draft brew was sampled at the brewery on the Boardwalk at Disneys Epcot Center attraction near Orlando Florida.  This brew poured a large head of foamy finely sized light brown colored long lasting bibbles that left behind a poor lace and atransparent light brown colored uncarbonated body.  The aroma was that of a simple malt hop one and the mouthfeel was initially smooth with a malt hop biting finish.  The flavor contained notes of mild caramel malt and hops.
"
1," Pitch black pour with a thin light brown head. Very good aroma of roasted malt, expresso and molasses. Solid flavor of expresso, molasses and roasted malt. The body is medium with a liquorous texture and moderate carbonation. Very well-done. Merci beaucoup Jonathan!

1," Poured very dark with a nice head. Aroma is all roast. Flavor is burnt burnt burnt, like a liquid burnt nothing.

"
1," AUG 26, 2006 Loved the bottle, the presentation, the trappist glass, the pour . . . everything but the beer itself.  I can say it was good, but it underperformed too-high expectations.  The soda-like carbonation dominated the tasting and I largely missed out on the other qualities.  Il need to re-rate as I gain greater sampling of similar highly rated beers.
"
1," Draft-Big River Brewery-Chattanooga, TN. A small sized white head with fine sized bubbles that mostly diminished. The nose was that of light malt and mild hops with a malty and hoppy flavor. The mouthfeel was somewhat tingly and smooth and it was light bodied with fair lacing.
"
1," JAN 7, 2006 Very obvious bourbon taste in the middle and end of this beer.  A little bitter in my opinion. Seems to finish good. Not alot of aftertaste. Have tried 2 Oatmeal stouts so far. Have not liked either one very much. Drinkable beer. Just not one of my favorites.
"
1," Found this one bottled at a liquor store in St. John, Indiana, as part of a mixed 12 pack of various beers from the state.  Hazy, medium brown pour with a thick, tan head, a nice malty nose, chocolatey and a bit of baked bread enhance this nice, malty ale.  An impressive brew in a so-so style.
"
1," Une rousse  la mousse phmre, filtr.  Odeur lgrement mielleuse mais un peu faible.  Got un peu fade avec douce amertume au finish.  Pas villain mais facile  oublier.
"
1," Nice Belgian dark strong ale.  Not too sweet or cloying like some other belgian dark ales or QUads.  Dark brown with amber highlights and a great lasting head.  Very spicy and yeasty aroma, with some caramel and sweet malts showing through.  Flavor is malty but dominated by a strong yeast profile which is high in phenolics much like Unibroue type beers.  Smooth sweet and complex wine-like finish.
"
1," Pretty old 11.2oz bottle. To the best of my knowledge, this is from about 2001 or 2002. Wasnt sure what to expect from this, seeing as its the smallest of the Chimay beers. Pours pretty dark red and hazy with a foamy head that fades to a nice ring around the glass edge. Nose is fruity and floral, with a little bit of a bubblegum-like note. Flavor has a lot of medium-dark malt, semi-sweet, and theres some yeast presence as well.  A fairly sharp carbonation, which surprised me for a beer thats this old. No evidence of oxidation, as far as I can tell. All in all, I was expecting this to be past its prime, but it seems to have held up nicely.
"
1," i wasnt digging on this as well as other belgians, was decent in flavor but did not show me anything i havent seen
"
1," When opening theres an overspill from the yeast surely. Lovely red colour and creamy head. Malty aroma. Taste is quite brash and lacking in hoppy bitterness, but the flavours grew on me and were quite satisfying by the end of the glass. Decent trappist ale.
"
1," on tap, nyc.  Nice dark red, malty aroma.  Sweet malty flavor.  Nice rose pedal palate.  the Blue is better- but this is a hell of a beer.  It has more kick.
"
1," Bottle thanks to thirdeye11. Garnet ruby pour with a small beige head. Aroma is lemon peel, light funk, barnyard, some acidity. Flavor is acidic, citrus hops, celery, ginger, bitter.
"
1," Pours to a dark brown mahogany body with a thin white head.  The aroma is nutty toasted brown malt, iced tea, and light earthy yeasts.  The flavor is sweet iced tea and toasty brown malts.  The palate is sweet, lightly tart, medium bodied, and chewy.
"
1," Bottle. Clear yellow - white head. A mild soft beer. White bread, straw, hay, fruity, orange. Nice.
"
1," Bottle. Aroma of dark fruits. Figs, toffee, raisins, tart cherries. Some yeast and a hint of alcohol. Pours deep brown with rich ruby highlights. Spicy yeast, creamy doughy malt on the tongue. Slightly tart and sour. Medium bodied. Fizzy carbonation. Finishes with a lingering tartness.
"
1," On of the best beers in the world. Any brew made by Men Of God who believe making a bad beer is a sin, is a beer of excellence.
"
1," Pours a copper red color with a thick off-white head. Lots of lacing and good carbonation. Aromas are strong citrus/cascade hops, The taste is dirt, cascade and centennial hops and some bitter orange peel. I dont taste or smell the Amarillo hops. Overall a strong west coast style IPA from Nebraska of all places!
"
1," Bottle. Nice golden with a medium fair lasting white head. Aroma is sweet with a deep maltiness. Flavour of sweet caramel with a good toasty maltiness, some fruitiness. Hoppy finish.
"
1," Draft at Keg Liquors Fest of Ale 2006.  Pours a light amber with a full white head and excellent lacing.  The aroma was very floral, with the summit hops coming through strongly.  The flavor is well balanced.  A good mixture of hops and malts makes it a really smooth beer, but with enough hops to please most hopheads.  I look forward to this one in bottles!
"
1," bottle.  large off-white cramy/rocky head (almost completely lastlng) with great lacing into light brown body with dediments aflowin.  aromas of candied sugar, lemongrass, and yeast.  flavor is sweet throughout with a touch of bitter at beginning.  great hop/yeast/malt balance.  great mouthfeel (very soft).  short to moderate finish duration.  above average carbonation.  Excellent.
"
1," DEC 23, 2007 bottle.  wonderful Trappist beer... this beer is so smooth and delicious.  it pours a deep red with a thick head.  Spice, malt and fruit notes in the aroma.  It is spicy on the tip of the tongue, but not overly so.... smooth and malty on the sides and a nice raisin finish.  This beer is extremely well balanced.  Very drinkable, nothing too strong and powerful, yet not weak and boring... its simply just right.

1," Very nice dark red color with a thick and lasting slighlty off-white head.  Spicey and slightly fruity aroma. Wonderful spicey clove flavor with a strong bitter finish and warming alcohol flavor. Tastes surprisingly strong for only 7% ABV. A real treat.
"
1," DEC 11, 2011 Unevenly dark beer with a thin, short-lived head. The aroma is quite complex, with dark fruits, caramel, a bit of yeast, malts, some booze, and also something very floral. The taste is just a little sweet, a little bitter, and even a bit sour. All the aroma notes come into the mouth as well, in a creamy, if a little watery, body with lively carbonation. Theres just something about it that feels somewhat artificial. The first time I had this beer I loved it, but all subsequent times have been somewhat disappointing.
"
1," FEB 21, 2004 My aim was to hit rating #70 before the end of the year. Accomplishing it with a Chimay Bleu with the christmas diner was not a bad way to do it.		Two bottles of Grande Reserva 2003 were used. Not as good looking as the Rouge, being an almost black, murky brown.		Aroma is of candy sugar, some alcohol and a hint of dark chocolates, along with perhaps some cellarlike smell.		The cellary feeling carries over to the flavour, which is fairly heavy, again with some dark chocolate, along with noticable alcohol and perhaps a tiny bit of cappucino.		Gives a very big feeling in the mouth, but not particularly complex.
"
1," Bottled. Golden coloured. Unclear. dense off white head. Aroma of grass, sweetness and herbs. Herbs, caramel, grass, sweetness. Medium bodied. Grassy bitterness in the end. This taste more like a pilsner than an IPA.

"
1," 11.2 ounce bottle in Westmalle glass.  (Chimay glass isnt beer-clean.)   Hazy golden orange with lasting white head and lace.  Lemon yeasty spicy sweet aroma.  Mild honey sweetness, fruity apricot orange spice with mild complex tobacco spcy peppry dry finish, some lingering peppery bitterness.  Medium body and medium carbo.  An absolute classic.  Awesome.  The only problem with this beer is that its too small.
"
1," 750ml bottle from SAQ. into chalice, pours a murky dark brown colour with a foamy white head that quickly dissipates. aroma is dried fruits, yeast, spices, and alcohol. taste is very complex. lots going on in here. very rich in yeast, notable malts, hops and spices. plums, raisins, and other dark fruits. lots of carbonation and an overall well balanced mouthfeel. pretty expensive, but well worth the money.
"
1," Very sweet and complex flavor with a clear alcoholic sting the malts and hops cannot hide. A very heavy beer, its impossible for me to drink many of these in a row.
"
1," 12oz bottle from StFun .  Pours murky brown with a 2 finger mocha head.  The nose is light metallic, vanilla, roasted malt and milk chocolate.  The taste is sweet bourbon, light wood, roasty malt, ashy cocoa and coffee in the finish.  Medium mouthfeel.  Tasty brew  thanks J!

1," Nice intens brownish beer with with a smooth a fluffy head.Fine aromas of malts and roasted malts with a touch of caramel and ahorn sirop.Round and caracteristic taste with hints of soft spices.
"
1," 330ml Bottle	fruity aroma, but not overpowering.  Slightly cloudy, with small yeast particles floating.  Excellent head, and wodnerful retention of the tiny bubbles.  Not very bitter, but a stronger alcohol flavor than I was expecting...  It finished nicely however.  I will certainly buy it again.
"
1," Pours a dark brown with a tanned head. Nice lacings. Low sweetness. Aromas of dark fruits, dark sugars. Quite yeasty, (but that might be the bartenders fault as he swirled the beer and poured the sediments from the bottom into the glass. I gave up on educating him.) Full bodied. Long dry fruity finish. Very nice.
"
1," Tap @ brewpub. Seven Bridges, Jax, FL.	Pours brown, thin beige head.	Aroma is malty, light caramel, hops and some yeasty notes.	Flavor, caramel malts, some nutty undertones and crystal malts.	Finished lightly bitter and hoppy with some malts.

1," Pours a clear gold color. Aroma and flavor of honey and apples with some dryness.
"
1," The best widely available Belgian dubbel until Westmalle becomes more widely nkown. Crisp, spicy, rich and full.
"
1," 12ozer from 21st Amendement Broad Ripple. Thin mocha head sits atop a deep dark brew. Smells incredible. Creamy, chocolatey, with a sweet roast. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Perfect weight in mouth. Bittersweet chocolate carries through. Bit of bitterness on the tounge. Mid roast. Bit thin on finish-could use a bit more there. But super solid beer here. Add this one to the rotation.
"
1," Aroma is nutty, fresh berries, earthy, dough.  A beautiful opaque dark brown pour with a reddish hue, nice creamy head that lasts and leaves good lacing.  Flavor is fruity, medium sweetness, earthy, malty goodness.  The yeast is a significant factor in the aroma and flavor.  Very lively carbonation is somewhat overwhelming at first but is better after it sits a bit.  Full bodied with an oily texture and clean, smooth finish.  This is a beer to write home about, pretty amazing.
"
1," An excellent Belgian Strong, but not as good as the Chimay Blue. Aroma is malty and delicious... smells of doughy bread. Appearance is a crimson brown that is crystal clear with a nice head that leaves good lacing. Taste and palate is smooth and creamy, malty and delcious. Slightly bitter but mostly sweet through the finish that stays with you but is not overly long. A wonderful step in the direction of the Blue.
"
1," Very solid.  A nice creaminess pervades the mouthfeel with a slick finish.  I think that was the most memorable part about the beer, but that is not to say the rest is bad.  The coffee is very rich, if a little bit acidic, and pairs well with the bitterness in the finish.  Very solid beer, if lacking a little in the aroma.
"
1," Nice strong belgian beer. Perfect fruit taste along with nice brown foam. Nice aroma. You can drink this one anywhere any time.
"
1," Pours a pitch black with a very stable, bubbly tan head.  Extreme intense coffee smell which is so powerful thats really all I get.  Would have liked to maybe get something else out of it as well.  Taste is definitely coffee as well.  It was pretty light bodied which somewhat disappointed me, but I suppose its not an imperial stout.  It pretty much tastes like coffee with carbonation, which isnt a terrible thing, but I was hoping for at least a little complexity.  Definitely drinkable but has nothing on founders breakfast in my opinion.
"
1," This beer was so spicey, roasty, and toasty, I just dont know whether Im comin or goin.  Its actually a pretty unique flavor that makes me thinks that those Belgians know what theyre doing.
"
1," Excellent!  I enjoyed this more than the Westy 12 and the Rochefort Trap as far as hyped beers go.  Very thick yet smooth and the alcohol is well hidden.  Wonderful blend of flavors.
"
1," Bottle thanks to blutt59. Pours a cloudy brown with beige head. Aroma of some nice clove, banana, malt and caramel. Flavor is tasty, malty, banana, clove, some light dark roast, faint caramel. Mouth feel is light-medium body with lively carbonation. Overall, tasty brew!
"
1," Very strong beer that gets stronger with age.  Must drink this one from a chalist style glass to get the full effect.  pour slowley and let it sit for several minutes before drinking
"
1," Cloudy dark tawny brown with thick head.  Rather meaty aroma with some graham crackerish notes, with a rusticity thats hard to pin down.  Sturdy alcohol.  Again a touch thin, fizzy with some crackery notes and a light yeast signature in the off-dry finish.
"
1," Bottle 330ml. Masterpiece. In the aroma butterscotch, caramel, and chocolate dominate; with grain in the background. Taste has sweet and bitter notes, long length, and a warmly alcoholic finish. Palate is creamy and full-bodied. Brown, with a creamy white head.
"
1," Draught in Nashville.  Pours amber with a small frothy white head and spotty lacing.  Fruity hop, pine and caramel malt aroma, medium roasted.  Hoppy pine and citrus flavor, caramel malt with a medium acidity.  Medium bodied and fizzy palate.
"
1," A big creamy, caramelized and well hoped barley wine.  Too easy to drink	How"
1," Beautiful mahogany color with a rich long lasting head like whipped cream. Pronounced fruity (bananas) and malty aroma. Very soft creamy mouth feel and malty aftertaste. Sweet malty taste. Superb.
"
1," Murky amber-brown colour witha nice lacing head.  Alcoholic, malty aroma.  Thin palate, brown sugar flavour.  Sweet and malty.  Quite possibly the most overated beer ever.

1," I love Chimay Red.  Try to drink after sitting in your glass a while.  It often comes a little too carbonated, and the wait raises the temperature to bring out the flavor. Great balance of sweetness and hops.  There are many better beers, but this is certainly one of the best 7% beers.  I prefer Red to Blue Chimay.
"
1, Chestnut brown. Off white skim. A tad bit of lacing left behind.		S
1," On tap at Disneys Boardwalk. Clear pale yellowish pour. Faint malty aroma. Crisp smooth slightly malty taste. Forgot it as soon as I finished it.

1," Definitely a classic for Belgian beers ... and of course if you go for drinking tons of bottle you get bored immediately. Better not in hottest summer ...
"
1," Thanks jdubfl for the share.  Pours clear gold with white head.  Nose is bread, corn, sweetness and a tiny amount of hops. Flavor is similar with water, hops, and sweetness.  Light bodied and not bad overall.
"
1," Golden color with a big bubbled white head.  Initial skunky nose with some grain.  Raw grain taste with some honey sweetness.  Some grassy notes and an almost lime citrus.  Really just another bad European lager.
"
1," Tap. Heavy smells of toasted and espresso, and a light resin smell, with wood in the background. Head massive, thick, creamy, light brown, with excellent lacing and is fully lasting. Flavor starts lightly sweet and acidic, then finishes lightly acidic and moderately bitter. Palate is medium, creamy and has a soft carbonation. Also lacking a bit on depth, but mostly a well crafted stout.
"
1," Hazy straw coloured.  Small white head.  Malted aroma, slightly floral in the background.  Not much goin on with this brew, but its not bad at all...better than i expected.
"
1," This is just too much alcohol for me. Oh yeah I drank the whole bottle. Just not my style. I am not there yet.
"
1," APR 23, 2008 750 mL bottle.  Highly carbonated - cork and suds flew out of there like champagne!  Poured into a snifter.  Orange in color, slightly hazy.  Huge pale head.  Aroma is very grainy, like fresh bread, with just a touch of sourness in the background.   Also earthy with just a little fruity component, but I cant identify it.  Taste was more hoppy and bitter than I expected and the alcohol was very pronounced, but after warming a bit it became much smoother and better balanced.  It coats the inside of my mouth and leaves a nice lingering bitterness.  Let this one warm a bit and its great.UPDATE"
1," I will not even try to add to what Michael Jackson has had to say about this beer!
"
1," Purchased at West Lakeview Liquors in Chicago, IL as part of a Chimay gift box with a glass, enjoyed after work on a Monday night.  Appearance a murky brown with a thin off white head.  Aroma of very pronounced dark fruit (fig, apricot), molasses, caramel malt, also rich in alcohol, very slightly sweet, complex (much more so than the red version).  Taste is high in alcohol as well as the dark fruit, gives it a chewy like flavor, very rich body.  Above average carbonation, it packs a punch for sure, its intense and very flavorful.  Theres also a drink-ability that makes it fantastic.  Of the 3 I like this one the best.
"
1," Sample from Rock Bottom Charlotte.  Poor beer.  Gold pour and no head.  Grassy aroma.  Very sweet, and somehow sticky in the swallow.
"
1," JUL 23, 2011 ...re8 330ml  In my Chimay goblet to try and make this a better expereince than previously , call my ass biased , but its cooler for it . nose is rasins, apple , some rich malts and yeasty must .  It looks very good , just like any o Chimay .. Its smooth and silky on opening , then notes of toffee apple , rasins , figs , some bitter  boozy notes in a dry creaminess.   Pretty nice on reflection.
"
1," SEP 30, 2007 Courtesy Quake.  Color is redolent of apricot jam and orange marmelade.  Aroma is toasted and malty.  Flavor is more of the same, not much discernable hop charecter.  Well past its prime.
"
1," Lovely rich smell, wonderful colour dark brown with sedimentation.  Flavor was strong, distinct and had a rich perfume or fruityness about it.  Had a nice bitter aftertaste.  Had a good head, light frothy and tasty, the head was much darker in appearance than most beers, including stouts.  All in all an excellent beer, if you like weisen beers then this one is a must buy and try
"
1," Perhaps I drank it to young? It has some faint notes of fruit in the aroma, but not enough. A bit sweet i flavor.
"
1," A deep red beer with a small disappearing brown head. The aroma is sharp and of coffee. The flavor is sharp, sour, and dry. With notes of hops.
"
1," 50 cL bottle, courtesy of kappldav123. Pours cloudy dark orange with a frothy and slight off-white head. Aroma is yeasty, fruity and wheaty, light roasted breadish. Sweet malty and estery fruity flavoured. Roasted malt finish with a apricot and banana to orange notes into the finish. Ends dry estery.
"
1," Pours a cloudy deep, dark reddish-brown color with a thick, frothy off-white head. Had the aroma of walking through a vineyard taking in the sweetness of the grapes and the earthiness of the soil. The flavor is a wonderful balance of roasted malt, wine, prunes, apple, bread, and a nice touch of light bitterness. There is some underlying alcohol but it fits in perfectly with the array of flavors and generous carbonation. This is a very nice beverage.
"
1," Very dark brown, blackish with a brown head.  The aroma was complex, roasted malts, coffee, chocolate and burbon.  A somkeyness fills the mouth and lingers contributing to a very nice full feeling.  Its also sweet early rolling to a roasted flavor and then a mild bitterness.  The burbon isnt noticable at first, but when it comes it provides very nice character.
"
1," bottle- ruby red in appearence, with a tan head. raisins, grapes, dark sour cherries dominate, with less of a profound finish than most belgiums. I prefered this to Blue, but was not wowed overall.
"
1," Aroma is nutty and mild.  Appearance is the usual brown ale, with a minimal head and lacing.   Flavor is of hazelnut and milk chocolate (a good sweet combination).  There is nothing especially rich or malt here, just sweet and a little thin.  There is some lingering astringency.  Not bad at all for 5% ABV.
"
1," On tap at brewpub. The color was green due to the St-Patrick event. Mix of cloves and banana. A good (normally) white beer.
"
1," (bottle, a present from pivnizub - thanks) Clear, dark brown colour with a short beige foam. Slightly roasted dark-malt aroma with a touch of spicy hops. Moderately roasted malty taste, quite bitter from the beginning; medium to light bodied, moderate carbonation; malty and bitter finish, slightly hoppy with hints of metal.
"
1," Very nice.  There should be a category for black ales.  Pours black with minimal rapidly dissipating head.  Taste is sharp with notes of roasted malt, earthy notes and floral hops.  Very good ale and would make for a frequent drink.
"
1," JUL 30, 2005 pours deep brown with a big beige head.  big aroma of yeast, raisins, currants, toffee and spice.  complex flavours of molasses, maple sugar, bitter chocolate and slight smoke.  pleasing bitter finish leads to slight alcoholic slo burn.
"
1," FEB 13, 2007 Re-rated (8/24/06) Pours a burgundy/brownish with a creamy off-white head. The aroma is full of soft fruityness, toffeish rasiny aspect & belgain yeasts. Its a very lively beer, creamy & smooth. Theres an early fruity zing, a bit peppery, wood-chip like and a spicy complexity of clove, nutmeg and a more dry yet clean&  smooth finish. Balanced.
"
1," AUG 17, 2005 (on bottle, grand reserve 2004 edit.) At last got my..stuff.. togehter and rated this classic. Its a cheastnut-brown brew, with a lasting, beige head. Mouth is creamy; with toffee, prunes, rotten fruits and alcohol. The yeast is there, but in the back. Tickling, perfect carbonation. Relativly hard alcoholtaste in the finish, along withthe easters, nothing more in the end actually.	Had my mother-in-law doing doing the santa shuffle a x-mas eve, a few years back, after a botlle of this stuff.	(on bottle at RBESG 2005 1990 edit.)	has gone over the top at this stage. Sent of cardboard and raisins.Finish is flat.
"
1," Pours a very dark brown with a good amount of white head. Smell is a little fruity but not sure what. This is a thick beer with a bit of a fig and carmel taste maybe a little raison in there as well. Very smooth as well. Terrific beer
"
1," JUL 6, 2004 Not a great belgian. Chimay have lacked quality in recently outings. Certainly a drinkable beer however.
"
1," Pours blonde with a small white head that leaves fairly quickly.  The aroma has a rich quality either from the white or orange - it doesnt list orange on the label, but it seems to have some.  Medium / light body with some sharp carbonation.  Flavor starts with nectarine flavor that has some plastic to it.  The some spiciness enters that goes through to the finish.  There is also some light astringency that comes through.  Not a bad beer, but much better of the style out there.
"
1," Very dark brown/near black pour. Thin and quickly receding tan head, fut bubbles cling for dear life at the glasses edge. Although totally one dimensional, the coffee that dominates the aroma is really pleasant and smells quite fresh. Also noted are sweet and black malts, oats, a sugary component that just feels like sugar added to coffee. This nose is very pleasant, bold too, just so lopsided. Quite tasty. Roasty coffee pervades, followed by well balanced roasted grains in good quantity, mild chocolate and milder still vanilla to round things out. Finishes off dry and mildly roasty. The bitterness that lingers throughout keeps this beer balanced and makes it incredibly quaffable. Nicely surprising, a well done coffee beer.
"
1," Dark brown to black pour, monster head. It took quite a while to fit this 22oz into a liter mug. Aroma smelled a little too much like sawdust and cheap booze. Flavor wasnt much better, some roastiness, and bourbon, but at least this didnt finish like licking a 2X4 the way their BA porter did.
"
1," Pours a dark brown with a thick tan head. Aroma of bourbon, chocolate and vanilla. Bittersweet chocolate flavor with hints of vanilla, bourbon. Bitter chocolate finish. Very drinkable. Would probably go great over some vanilla ice cream!
"
1," Yeast, port wine, chocolate, some pepper and vanilla and slightly lactic. Strong body, it weights in your tongue.Taste"
1," Bottle thanks to bu11zeye. Pours a murky brown color with a small creamy head. Nose of chocolate, peanut butter, and nuts. Sticky mouthfeel. Taste is caramel, molasses, spice, and those little belgian dark chocolate candies. Nice.
"
1," nothing to see here folks, just move along...
"
1," Hooray Beer! I was offered this instead of the Heiny Light that I had initially ordered. The waiter said ""this will be the best beer youve ever had"". Bingo! 	At about $10 a bottle, this will be my gifting substitiute for wine for years to come.
"
1," Pours an attractive dark brown. Pleasant aroma and well balanced. Overall I would say this is a generally average belgian ale, not remarkable - but tasty.
"
1," smoke, chestnut, creme brule. Simple Ale, dry, with light caramel flavor, very light smoke, wood. Correct bitterness. Simplistic.
"
1," bottle from monooly outlet, oslo.	Pours hazy brown with creamy tan head. Weizen-like aromas with yellow fruits. Kinda dry, but still fruity. Some sweetness in the end.
"
1," One of the best beers available in Chile. Toasted malts, caramel, toffee, fruits, its all there. Every time I have one I discover something different.
"
1," Very bitter, being fair to it it is nice, but not my style, very amber in colour.
"
1," Dark brown with a thin tan head.  Aroma of heavily roasted malts, lightly bourbonized with undertones of coffee and peat.  Notes of oak and vanilla creep through as it warms.  Taste is a bit under whelming at first.  Thin bodied and mild tasting I was expecting more after taking in the aroma.
"
1," MAY 3, 2008 Apperance"
1," Attractive reddish brown appearance with a subdued aroma of yeast and a hint of vanilla.  Soft carbonation with a malty, full-bodied mouthfeel and a slightly metallic finish.
"
1," SEP 30, 2008 Bottle... Post RBSG 08 O-Town/Vero Beach Throwdown Chapter 8...  Clear, deep, dark mahogany ale with a small, creamy, khaki head. Decent retention. The fruity, estery aroma provides notations of chocolate and banana. Medium-bodied with lively carbonation. Perfectly balanced, but theres just not much going on. Finishes bland and watery. Its not my cup of tea, but thanks to SoLan for providing the bottle of beer!
"
1," Dark amber in colour. nice thick head, yeasty tatse.
"
1," Not black at all--deep ruby at best.  MIld, malty caramel, slightly sour, and disappointingly dull. Thin palate.  (on tap--cask I believe--at Toby Jug, Glasgow)
"
1," A new Trappist beer! A very nice, amber coloured beer. Nice head, and when you get your nose in it, you will immediatly recognise the typical Chimay aromas!	Its a really smooth, full, easy drinkable, refreshing beer. Sweet, but with more than enough bitterness.	(33cl bottle at Auberge du Mont des Cats)
"
1," 750 ml bottle.  Pours hazy amber with a thick, long lasting off-white head. Aroma is of dark fruit, yeast and brown sugar.  The body is full and crisp.  Taste is a lot of dark fruit, brown sugar and spicy hops. Long lasting, dry finish.  I used to like this brew much more.  Must be my taste has changed over the years.
"
1," Darkish orange. Fitish the traditional american defitnition of IPA.  Strong Floral hops but still very drinkable.
"
1," Sampled on tap at the Alibi Room, pours rusted reddish brown with a tiny head. Aroma and flavour are like the forest - earthy, evergreen bark, juniper berries and twigs, and some interesting spices. Neat experiment, though I glad I only had a small sample.
"
1," 2009 bottle. Rich blackberry and dates hit the nose the second the cap is opened, before theres even been a chance to pour it into its matching Trappist glass.		From the glass you also can pick up a deep, rich sweetness not unlike port, as well as the immediate berry and date aromas.		On the tongue it begins with malt, toffee and spices, followed by the deep port-like flavours and a dry, lightly tart finish with warming alcohol. Barely a hint of hops to speak of - the rich complexity derives mostly from the malt and Belgian yeast. Silky mouthfeel.		Given a few more years ageing this could be spectacular. For the meantime its an excellent example of the style; perhaps a nose or two behind the Rochefort 10.
"
1," Nice reddish, mahoganny color with a creamy off white head..  Nice fruity, yeasty, malty, aroma with a hint of cloves.  Great flavor apricots, bananas with an extra shot of fizziness right up front.  Very palatable.  Like it alot.  Great brew.
"
1," Pours cloudy and golden with a thin white head.  Hoppy citrus aroma.  Flavor is moderately hoppy.  Beer goes down very smooth.  Very tast beer.

1," Dark brownish colour with no head.Aroma is sweet and fruity with smooth well balanced mouth feels.Flavor of brown sugar and raisins.Vinous and soft finish.
"
1," Can. Pours a pale brown color with a small off-white head. Has a fruity malty caramel aroma with some hints of chocolate. Sweetish malty caramel flavor with some roasted hints. Has a sweetish malty caramel finish.
"
1," On nitro at the brewpub.  Very cream head on black.  Coffee bitter taste,also some element of orange, roasted black aroma.  A thick mouthfeel.  Carbonation right there.
"
1," Opaque burgundy-brown, with a thin but dense creamy tan head. The aroma has a dry, fruity malt sweetness and a somewhat earthy character. The flavor has notes of sweet raisins, chocolate, earthy yeastiness, and theres a bit of a spicy finish. Very effervescent, but still quite drinkable.
"
1," Hellmalziger, ziemlich laffer Antrunk. Wenig herb, weiter wssrig und nur bedingt malzig, was leider das einzige und strkste Aroma darstellt. Hopfiger zum Abgang, wenig passend, insgesamt disharmonisch. Nicht wirklich gelungen. 8/7/7/8/7/7
"
1," JUN 13, 2008 11.20 bottle"
1," 2005 bottle shared with SuIIy on 11/23/05.  The bottle says it is unfiltered and unpasteurized, but yet, the beer pours the most fizzy, clear thing I have seen lately.  If this isnt forced carbonation, than its the strangest natural carbonation Ive ever experienced.  Deep cola brown, somewhat dull, not much in the auburn-red tinged department, as some deeper colored stouts have.  Tan-beige head is mountainous and very very slow to recede.  Lacing present.  Aroma of straight bourbon, dry and lightly alcoholic, with light vanilla and very dry wood.  Hints of bakers chocolate, some light yeast and very little else.  No sweet malt, no creamy oat-like notes, no hops.  Flavor is full bourbon.  Hints of peanut skins, salt, seltzer water and alcohol.  Pure bourbon, dry wood and light roast.  Its not that the bourbon is overdone here, its just that the beer is underdone.  No malt sugars, little if any chocolate or roast.  Body seems very filtered, though they say it is not.  Carbonation is omnipresent, sharp, obtrusive and very high.  Texture is watery, loose, prickly and thin on end.  As it warms, the aroma takes on a note of glue or hot plastic.
"
1," FEB 1, 2003 This one pours a very dark, cloudy brown color with a medium sized off-white head. The aroma is strongly sweet, with hints of malts, yeast, and spices. Full bodied and very fruity, the flavor is rich with tones of yeast and spices. The finish is long and sweet. Yummy, quite a nice Belgian ale. Dear God, when I die, can I wake up in a vat of fine Belgian ale. I'm not picky, at long as it is in a vat of Westveleteren 12, Westmalle Tripel, or Chimay. I promise I'll share my beer with all the starving kids in Africa. God?? Please?? Are you listening???
"
1, Glasflasche 	Noten
1," (bottle) Almost clear amber coloured hue with a big foamy slightly off-white head. Sweet malty aroma with caramel, cloves and traces of alcohol. Sweet wheat-malty initial taste with caramel and only a shy touch of fruitiness, the alcohol becomes more and more apparent towards the finish, which is sweetbitter malty with a distinctive clovy note. This is definitely not my first-choice Weizenbock, but it is still decent.
"
1," Nice brown colour with light brown head. Nice amount of fruits and yeast in the aroma. Sweet and spicy taste, dark fruits and raisins. Nice one.
"
1," Pours a murky, brown-red colored body with an inch thick, creamy and frothy, off-white head that dissipates slowly and leaves a good amount of lacing. Aroma is nice. The caramel malty sweetness is clearly present, but comes off as thinner rather than fat. There is also a light bread to the malts. Lots of yeast with a light spice and some vinous characteristics. There is a good deal of citric fruits, apricots, grapes, and some raisin. Flavor is similar, not quite as nice as the aroma in my opinion.  Some thinner caramels and a little more noticeable toffee flavor. Lots of yeast and somewhat spicy with more of a darker fruit flavor, but still a good deal of lighter colored fruits. Finishes somewhat vinous with a light bitterness, a bit thin, and fairly dry with a moderate aftertaste. Medium carbonation and body. Overall, a nice dubbel. Not exceptional, but consistently reliable. Very drinkable and well made.
"
1," pours a copper brownish red with a nice off white head that laces nicely. the nose is of sweet summer fruit, plums, apricot, light malts and grains. A very balanced beer that is a good option to bring to dinner at a non craft fans house.
"
1," (bottle) pours a clear golden colour with a frothy white head. aroma of grainy pale malts and honey, with notes of tangy hop spices and pineapple. flavour is the same, quite fruity and grainy with pronounced hoppy notes, almost like a tripel. heavy body with mild carbonation and a light bitter finish.
"
1," Pours brown with a big off white head.  The head only lasted a little bit on this one.  Aroma had a big caramel and spicy hop note.  Flavor was much of the same,  but it had some woody cork flavors,  spicy hops,  caramel,  toffee,  and lots of fruit qualities.  Finishes mildly bitter, dry, with quite a bit of carbonation.  I wish it wouldnt have taken me so long to try this,  very good.
"
0," Nose of some malts, quite unpleasant. Golden colored, small white head. Sweet grainy flavor.
"
1," Great as expected from Chimay. Nice sweet and creamy flavor with a well defined head. Chimay makes a good strong brew with a smooth finish!
"
1," When aging beer, there is always a little bit of Russian roulette involved. While there are certain standards and guidelines to assist one on their path of building a beer cellar, risk is always an enjoyable factor; the mystery and challenge of aging a beer to its peak of supping perfection. The reward is beyond words and the thrill is one of lifes best. Chimay is a premier Trappist brewery in Belgium, offering 3 sublime beers to the unworthy masses. First and foremost is their Premier, or Red, as it is sometimes referred to. Chimay themselves recommend enjoy Premier as fresh as possible; within a year, so it was a delightful surprise when popping the cork on my bottle at home to discover I was about to indulge on a vintage 2007 bottle. Glory days are here again.			Hazy ruby and blood-orange depths fill my glass thick and full. A bit hazier than usual, an attribute I would pin on her age. A gentle khaki head settles slowly into a puffy layer of foam which makes way for a succulent nose of sweet honey-glazed dessert breads soaked in rum and brandy. Plums, black grapes, red pears, red licorice, red apples, and ripe apricots bring a cornucopia of tropical and succulent fall fruits to life. Cinnamon sticks sprinkle spice unto her fruity bouquet while candied fruits and apple juice mingle atop moist rye bread and fruitcake. Her nose lacks a crisp bite but more than makes up for it in softness which has melded together in exquisite ripeness. Sufficiently impressed with her nose, those hazy luscious depths are calling my name; naturally I answer. Sweet, bready, rummy, fruity, spiced, and just darn tasty. Slightly mouthcoating, honey and maple esters stick to my lips and sides of cheeks while I bite into red apples, pears, plums, black grapes, and apricots, their skins bursting with a crunch, juices trailing down the sides of my mouth. Smackerific. Cinnamon sticks and rum soaked rye breads mingle together in each meaty quaff while the middle of her palate slowly dries mine. Not overly dry; just enough to induce my thirst and encourage further quaffing indulgence. Dry wood tickles the back of my throat while cinnamon, rum, and brandy spice my breath and warm my chest. Melting in her boozy warmth are all her juicy meaty fruity delights. Exquisitely rich, sweet, fruity, warm, and ending with a dry spiced flourish; I must say I enjoy her with some age a bit more than fresh, though for a totally different set of reasons.			Chimay never fails to please and sometimes even surprise. While I wouldnt age the Premier as long as I would their Grand Reserve, by all means bring home a few bottles. Enjoy one fresh, but then save the others for later supping in whatever randomly timed intervals you so please.
"
1," Bottle looks simple but good. Beer in the glass copper coloured, small head. Starts washy, modest malty, not too yeasty. Light notes of caramel. Finish fruity-moldy, still washy. Not good.
"
1," Bottle. Pours brown with a distinct reddish tinge to the edge. Aroma is fruity leading to a smooth finish. My least favourite of the three, but still a decent beer.
"
1," Copper brown, with large rocky cap, massive bubble creators are forming everywhere in it. Mild soapy aroma some coffee and a touch of sweaty feet, yum yum doesnt that sound appetizing. Taste is watery with weak malts, hops or noticeable with a very mild bitterness. I got to remind myself this an EPA, not an APA. Some peach and mild coffee and chocolate also show up. Very boring beer with not nearly enough malt character, bellow average and easily forgettable.
"
1," SEP 2, 2008 Beautiful hazy dark amber color with a nice lacing beige head. Moderated aroma of caramell, vanilla and some banana. The taste is less than i expected, but great and balanced. Smooth mouthfeel with a little dry at first, caramel, some toffee and roasted malt a little alcohol and a good, mild bitterness. Liqueric aftertaste.
"
1," Poured a clear dark red-brown color with an off-white head.  Chalky roasted malt with some phenoles, ash and hops all thrown in.  Very light roasted sweet malt.  Hint of chocolate.  Light-medium body.

1," Beautiful bronze appearance with  generous head that only lingered for awhile.  Fruit and spice in the aroma.  Lots of carbonation.  Sweet and fruity   taste, balanced with a little bitterness.
"
1," 330ml bottle from Vinmonopolet in Norway. Hazy, copper brown in colour. Beige and dense head slowly diminishing. Sweet spicy aroma. Assorted flavours of sweet and tart fruit, blackcurrants, spices and hops towards a yeasty backbone. Medium to full bodied. Medium dry finish. Enjoyable, but the peppery yeastiness is a bit over the top.
"
1," bottle.  fizzy khaki colored (quickly dissapating) head into murky blackish-red body.  decent lacing.  some ripe fruits (cherries and berries mostly), yeast and malts were all noticed in the aroma.  flavor is sweet with light bitterness in finish.  fizzy carbonation.  no suprise to anyone this one is good but not as good as the blue.

1," JUL 31, 2010 Bottle"
1," Legendary.  Dark brown body with the usual head and lacing of the Belgian beers.  Aroma is complex and includes grapes, prunes, toffee, licorice and even chocolate.  Taste is hard to explain.  There is so much flavour but nothing dominates.  A mouthgasim of flavour that must be experienced to be appreciated.  Finish is dry and leaves me craving more.

1," Hazy orange with a medium off white head. Sweet yeasty aroma with malt, wheat and caramel notes. Sweet yeasty flavour with malt, caramel and banana notes. Finished sweet.

1," Excellent dark color, bit of a coffee aftertaste, nice aroma, nice full body beer.  Will definitely be drinking this one again.
"
1," I was a little worried about disappointment given the rating going in -- but no worries.  This is an amazing beer by any measure.  The aroma is a bit subdued for an in-bottle fermentation, but the taste and mouthfeel are so rounded and silky that theyre hard to surpass.  The 9% content is scarcely noticeable but necessary to add a bit of pleasant astringency to what would otherwise be a very heavy ale.  Very floral notes to both the aroma and the flavour.  All in all well worth the money.
"
1," Draught@brewpub (Portland, OR)	Clear golden color, small white head. Light bubblegummy aroma. Light-bodied. Light wheatyness in the flavor, but also quite grainy notes with kind of papery flavors. Odd and weak.

"
1," 0.33l bottle / Chimay tulip glass at Tolkiens House, Zagreb. Finally found it.....  Poured a very small ochre thick head, and a completely misty dark brown colour, impressive, but not a 5 in my opinion. The nose was nice, raisins, plums, alcohol. Very complex taste. Nice plummy fruitiness giving way to a fine underlying lemony sourness forming in the middle a taste reminiscent of forest fruits, like forest strawberry. Id probably say it tasted like port with a sourish background, but Ive never tasted port so I wouldnt know (duh), and the best I can explain it as prosecco-but-not-as-sweet-with-a-sour-background. So there you go. Ah, right, aftertaste. Not much hops present, but they arent really needed here. Malty aftertaste that feels at times slightly odd, similar to what you get when sucking a peach seed (faint though).
"
1," Soothing aroma with a nice kick of coffee taste. Infusing coffee with a good model brew is a classical way of describing such a great drink. Seriously, I think I drinking iced coffee here, quite nice.

1," Bottle at parents house. caramel, resin, black, aminimal head, medium bitterness, medium body, oily feel, average carbonation,
"
1," Small bottle.  Pours a deep amber color, clear, except for the few yeasties that made it in the glass.  Nice sized off-white head that lingers indefinitely and leaves suprisingly little lacing.  Aroma is fruity and sweet with hints of cola.  Plenty of yeast in the nose.  Lighter bodied with a high level of carbonation that never seems to fade.  Ample bitterness balances the sweet sugar and fruit flavors nicely.  Decently done.
"
1," Enjoyed on tap at the brewpub.  Fruity aroma, and yeasty.  Drinkable, not bad, hits the style.

1," What more can I say about this classic? It has a nice sweetness to it and some light yeastiness with lots of dark fruits churning around. The fruits sweetness comes out more with warmth. A very pleasant beer, too bad it costs so much.
"
1," MAY 13, 2007 Strong alcoholic taste that overpowers the flavor lying underneath. I was disappointed in this beer, considering the high ratings given on by the ratebeer users. Once past the original sting, this beer has a nice taste and decent aroma. I prefer Chimay Red to this one, however. Original rate 3.3.	Re-rate"
1," DEC 19, 2005 Bottle, at home, vintage 2002 & 2004.	Dark brown with light brown head. Nice lacings. Aroma and flavor of malt (brown sugar) and light hops (resin). Sweet with a well balanced bitterness.
"
1," Tasted 2007-03-10. 3 year old bottle, 75cl. Aromas of basement and a hint of plums. Clear, reddish brown colour with a fast disappearing head. Medium sweetness. Good initial bitterness, that fades too quickly. The aftertaste is a bit metallic. Not as complex as Id hoped it would be after 3 years, but definately a great beer! It improved a lot during its time in the glas.
"
1," Poured a drak brown with a large off white head that diminished to thin but staying. Very strong raisin and clove aroma with some alcohol. Strong flavour of cloves and dark fruits with some herbal notes. Lost a coupkle of points due to often overpowering alcohol. Big, beautiful beer.

1," Bottle - Mild aroma - bananas primarily.  NIce cloudy amber color.  Flavor continues on the mild side - banana and cloves with a bit of peppery feel.
"
1," From bottle to Trappist Glass.  Pours dark brown with no head.  Smells of Fruits and candies.  Taste was strong with heavy sugars and coffee.  Some Chocolate and then an alcohol aftertaste.  Over all, pretty good beer.

1," foamy, malty and sweet with caramel and dried mostly dark fruits. Balanced with some new fruit and spice including licorice and a bitter tinge of hop. Moderate slick sweet body that is a bit milky and completes an impressive overall package.
"
1," Excellent beer...pour a dark copper color with a nice head a great lacing.  I smelled raisins, malt and spice.  The taste is very complex, a nice change up from the white and blue.
"
1," Tap Rockbottom (Atlanta) - Dense black, creamy light tan head.  Rich nose of mocha cream, roasted oats, cocoa, and a kiss of vanilla.  Flavor is more of the same with soft espresso, milk chocolate, and toasted vanilla bean.  Light to medium bodied and very smooth, soft carbonation, light bittersweet, coffeeish finish.  Best beer of the lineup in this location...
"
1," 11oz. bottle. Large off white head. Murky brown color. Fruity, (banannas, apples)and somewhat sulfury nose. Medium body. Nice mouthfeel, carbonation level is perfect. Fruity flavored, apples and some raisiny notes lead to a dry spicey finish, Nice 7%er
"
1," JAN 27, 2006 Bottled 6/2005. While this is far from my first beer tasting, this is my first rating. My wife and I even went so far as to purchase a set of Chimay glasses to start things off right. Yeah, I know! Anyway, I was reasonably impressed, but not blown away by this beer. The aroma is very yeasty/doughy with some sweet odors and a bit of apple and citrus (lime/lemon). The head was fairly small and died off quickly - leaving a somewhat unattractive brown foam. While this was a bit disappointing, the overall appearance was very nice - like deep reddish brown shoe leather. At first I found the carbonation to be overly strong for my taste buds, but found this beer improved greatly after sitting in the glass for about ten minutes. Taste is fairly alcoholic and creamy. Overall, a very nice beer. (Addendum - after this rating, I had the opportunity to drink a ten year old Chimay Blue - Much, Much better - more like a 4.5)
"
1," Deep clear burgundy pour with a thick light tan head with outstanding retention. Aroma is dark fruits, raisins, sweet malt, grapes. Taste is dark fruit, molasses, raisin, and the light sweetness of Belgian yeast and candi sugar. Palate is velvety smooth with a perfect carbonation level. Nothing mind-blowing here, just a great classic abbey ale from the country that does them best.
"
1," Nano Festival  Portland OR 2010	Hoppy aroma with a good amber coloring.  The flavor was fresh with roasty malt and good hops.  I liked the finish of the IPA very fruity and dry.
"
1," [Bottle, February 2007] Depp reddish brown pour with frothy head. Aroma is berries. Mouthfeel is fizzy and wet. Strong cherry/berry fruit flavors.
"
1," On tap at Springfield location.  Pours a translucent golden amber with really no head.  Aroma of caramel, grains and light hops.  Flavor was malty with a light hop presence.  Really kind of non-descript overall.
"
1," Pour is a jet black with a small tan head.  Aroma is all thing roasted.  Some wood smoke and coffee.  Flavor is more in the coffee catagory but not to overpowering to make it bitter.  Some chocolate helps to sweeten it so itss not so bitter.  Its not Founders breakfast stout but its a close cousin.
"
1," A very fine dubbel. On the bottle is it chimay brune.
"
1," JAN 4, 2004 A thick white head on top of a deep brown ale. Both aroma and taste are fruity, yeasty, sweety, malty...This all comes to you in a complex blend. A classic.
"
1," (Draught) Sampled at the Great Canadian Beer Festival in Victoria, BC, September 8th 2008. Pours a lasting white, thin head with a clear golden body. Nose is mildly lemony and corn. Somewhat tonic tongue, though the texture is pretty good. There is a lasting corn meal finish. Good. 7/3/6/3/12
"
1," Dark red. Sweet mandarin aroma, quite appealing, that later developed some maltiness. Oily taste, rather thin, and consisting mainly of slightly surgical alcohol. A hint of coffee and some late bitterness. Despite the rather cute aroma, the overall effect is not to my taste.
"
1," Good mahogoney color.  Light tart aroma.  Sits well on the palate.  Not as full bodied as the bleu.
"
1," pale golden colour with a white head. Malty aroma with cereal notes. Malty and sweaty barnyard flavor.
"
1," Poured a nice golden color with a white head. Aroma is of nice candy sugar, spices, and some perfume. Flavor was much the same, sweet spiced and a bit sour.
"
1," FEB 19, 2003 Springfield, PA. I've never had the Budvar Cristal but this is exactly what I imagined it to be.  A clean and refreshing, hoppy beer, med bodied with plenty of flavor.  This beer's only downfall is an unpleasant bitterness in the aftertaste.
"
1," A thick and creamy head sits atop this placidly dark beer with strong hints of pear, clove, and earth. 	Actual flavor ends up blossoming on the tongue with a light effervescence and tasting of licorice, cola, and milk chocolate - the finish is short and sweet.	Chimay Blue would be a fine dessert offering along side grapes and a washed rind cheese.
"
1," Thanks to hopdog for throwing me this requested bone...	Appears a dark mahogany brown bordering black with a 3 finger tan head that slowly fades out. Spotty lacing is left behind.	Smell is slightly tart, with black grapes, raisins, roasted nuts, dust, and light American Oak, along with mild cocoa...wheres the bourbon I was hoping for???	Taste is of black grapes, raisins, nuts, and cocoa without anything complex going on. If I dig deeper, there are hints of cola and a touch of vanilla and caramel.	Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a light sweetness highlighted with vanilla cream, and cocoa sticking to the tongue. Semi-dry finish.
"
1," Not sure what cloying mans, but I know that this beer was too strong for me.  It had quite a ""bite"" to iy and overwhlemed me.  I almost didnt finish it, but then managed to appreciated the strength.  I am sure it is a great beer but not for me.
"
1," Cask Stillage from the outside bar at the Hillsborough Hotel, Sheffield 16/12/2006	Bubbly white head. Hop aroma. Golden coloured hoppy and fruity plum flavour. Crisp and bitter slightly dry finish.
"
1," An extremely well balanced beer.  Ive had the bleu a long time ago and tasting it again.  I do like the banana and hint of clove.  Nothing stands out too much.  What I do like about this beer is that its complex flavor that leaves you guessing its ingredients.  The alcohol is hidden well.  I wouldnt consider bringing a 6-pack of this too a football game but it would pair  well with beer and chicken.
"
1,"nice brown reddish colour, foams a lot but it dissapeared fast	S"
1," orange in color with a dirty white head, citrus and caramel aroma, flavor is of citrus and has the perfect amount of hops.  great ipa
"
1," Although Ive only had a few Tripels this one stands out as my favorite.  To describe this in one word would be Balance.  Great look, nose, and taste.
"
1," Very let down with this one. I really enjoy Brass Knuckles, and liked the Bourbon Aged Oatmeal Stout. But, this one? Not so much. Very strong bourbon all around, in the aroma, the flavor, everything. The dark berries take a backseat, and the oatmeal isnt really noticeable at all. Texture is rich and creamy, but the bourbon is just too much.
"
1," Hard to get excited about this.  A pale lager with very little bitterness, not much malt, and a thin mouth feel.  Pale golden lager with a small white head.  Best feature is a significant degree of floral hops.  But it was served in a charming little bistro overlooking the harbor in Newport Beach California, and I was delighted to find something that was not Bud or Miller.
"
1," Dark brown with light brown foam head. Roasty aroma along with malt, caramel, dry fruits. Very round taste with malts, some caramel, light sweetness and lightly bitter with something like raisins at the end. Full body, creamy and long finish. A good experience.
"
1," DEC 16, 2003 Dark with a gold tint.  Nice malty and roasted smell, complex.  Rich and full-bodied flavor that tingles the palate.  Very fruity.  The taste of the alcohol gets stonger towards the end as it warms a little.  Subtle explosions of different flavors.  This beer will always be welcome in my house!
"
1," Aroma is more yeasty than malty.  The head was good, but not as large as I expected. The flavor is extremely smooth with one of the best finishes I have ever experienced. More drinkable than I expected, I could have a few of these.
"
1," This beer pours a cloudy brown with hints of red around the edges.  It has a minimal head and minimal lacing - a very attractive looking beer.  The aroma is filled with fruits and malts.  The flavor is very enjoyable.  It has a lot of fruity flavors and it is fairly sweet and full bodied.  The alcohol is vaguely apparent, but just to the point that it adds character to the flavor.  I would highly recommend this beer as well as the other Chimay products.
"
1," deep mahogony pour with thick foamy off white head.  dark fruit, baked bread, and nutty malt aroma.  dry, dark figs strengthen in finish.  a bit aggressive up front.  body is well balanced and moderate.  My wife picked this up for me after I had a long run.  thanks meg.
"
1," Bottle. Creamy white excellent fully lasting head. Orange colour. Not so powerfull but nice aroma. Moderate bitter and sweet flavor. Caramellic notes. Average finish. Creamy palate. Not quite as good as expected, but it is a nice beer.
"
1," My favorite Chimay.  Wonderful balanced tastes.  A Belgian that is not too yeasty and smells fresh.  Flowers, fresh ingredients and a balanced character make this my favorite Belgian.
"
1," APR 23, 2008 This is not a style that I have tried much or like much. Thankfully not as sweet as typical fruity BA and manages some dryness.  The soapy banana and acidic fruit peal taste is off putting.
"
1," MAY 27, 2009 A 2005 bottle in Reims.  My first strong Belgian.  Vinous and fruity, ruby brown with a tan head.  Malty, warming, and complex with a creamy mouthfeel.  Wouldnt mind a taller bottle. [3.8]Long-overdue re-rate in late May 2009, this one from a fresh bottle.  Sweet malty nose, clearly Belgian yeast.  Floral with some mineral water.  Dark amber-mahogany pour with a highly-carbonated sudsy (and noisy!) tan head.  Taste is very firmly bitter in addition to the sweet malt.  Mineral water and lightly metallic rocky notes are too strong.  Medium-fullish body, slippery malt profile, feel is strongly carbonated, dries out.  Plums and figs/raisins, a great little synergistic effort from the little guys.  Lightly warming but well-integrated and structured, and Id have had no idea this was a niner.  Id to this again expecting to knock it down a peg or two, but darn, shes still a winner! [3.7]
"
1," Poured from tap a golden color with a light haze and smallish creamy white head.  Soft aroma of rising bread with a touch of apricot.  Flavor is heavy on yeast, doughy with some wheat, banana, and apricot.  There is a nice sizzling acidity from the high carbonation and good burst of sweetness on the initial taste.  Easy drinking with a nice alcohol warmth afterward.
"
1," Another great brew from the trappists.  Strong but not overwhelming.  Drinkable and good.  pours quality and remains quality till the end.
"
1," My favorite beer in the whole world so far.  I first tried this in Bellingham, WA in a sampler with the red, white, and blue.  I saved the blue for last and it was definately the premium.  Must have a trappist glass so the head doesnt overwhelm you.
"
1," Tap at Sixteen Tons. Hazy orange pour with fluffy white head. Flavor and aroma mainly pine and citrus hops with a mild caramel backing. Pretty typical PNW IPA.
"
1," Well, the cork exploded out of the bottle, ricocheted off the ceiling and landed right in the trash can. St. Bernardus ABT 12 has totally warped my impressions of many dark Belgians, but this one is still impressive none the less. Loads of carbonation. Spice on the tongue is what hits me the most. Mild hop caress on the dry finish. It has all of those typical Belgian characterisitcs of dried fruits, flowers, spice, candy sugar or caramel. The anise spice and flowers really come alive on the finish. I could still drink it anytime, anywhere.
"
1," Malty, fruity and a bit alcoholic, dusty and spicy. Pretty good but not one of my favorites. Have to try a vintage one some day to see how this ages.
"
1," Shared bottle at RBNAG 11. Hazy orange body with a big off-white head. Aroma is malt, dry fruit, grapefruit and spices. Flavor is sweet malty, ripe fruity and spicy. Medium body, quite Belgium in style without being too sweet. Nice trappist, but not superb.
"
1," Great beer, excellent flavor, aroma, appearance, and very pleasing to my palate! You can find this great beer in the Belgium beer section at Bev Mo. This is a must try, dont let the price put you off it is well worth the $.

"
1," Ok, while this beer looks average, it taste great!  Just a smooth porter that is really quite enjoyable.
"
1," Tasted a bottle of 1999. First taste reminds more of old books and dust but in the end a subtle sweet taste takes the upperhand. Very nice carbonisation for this age still.
"
1," Pours hazy brown with a thin tan head. Aroma of bready malt and ripe fruit. Taste is smooth sweet fruit with nothing dominating just perfectly balanced. Clean finish.
"
1," Pours a reddish brown with a nice thick long lasting head. Fruits and spices in the aroma which of course transfers into the taste. Cinnamon, clove, bread, mild hops and a nice finish. Currently trying to age a few.Yum.
"
1," 11.2 oz bottle - Pours reddish brown with a big, foamy head.  The aroma is light and fruity.  The flavor strikes a nice balance between the malt sweetness and some bitterness, along with very apparent fruit notes.  The palate is very lively and smooth, though it could stand to be a little more full.  The finish is dry.  This is a very good beer.  Though at four bucks for a small bottle being easily the best price Ive found on it, Id like to see something a bit more full and complex.
"
1," In the past Ive found stronger ales not to be to my liking. Not sure what makes the difference but this is quite drinkable. I didnt find the aroma to be all that interesting but the key to this drink is its rich flavor, slightly bitter leading tip sweet notes at the end. Very pleasant.

1," Pours brown with a tan head.  Smells of sweet malt, some earthy hints.  Tastes earthy with some peppery splashes and a sweet finish.
"
1," Draught at St. Augustines, VancouverDark brown color. Light chocolate and mint aroma. Roasted malt flavor, with light dark chocolate tones, and a more evident mint touch; dry mouthfeel; roasted malts in the finish. After Eight chocolates are better, as they are sweeter; but not a bad beer...
"
1," MAY 16, 2007 corked 10/03. Stupid huge head pilled high with billions of (nitro?)	bubbles.  It hung around for awhile too. The nose was malty, alcoholic, and caramel like. It tastes very good but I was let down by the HUGE alcohol taste. It was excessive, especially for 9%. I got malts, candy apples, and ,oh yeah, alcohol. I sure this beer mellows well with time, and maybe that would change my opinion.
"
1," 11.20 oz. / 33 cl bottle.  Tasted immediately following The Bruery Autumn Maple.  Pours opaque with obvious clumps of (presumably) yeast.  Aroma is familiar Belgian and pleasing.  Taste is subtle, alcohol is pretty well hidden and there is more taste and dryness on the finish than the start.   Not as malty or sweet as some other Belgians.
"
1," 33cl bottle from Vinmonopolet. It poured a reddish-brown colour with a medium white head that settled down fast in the glass. The aroma smells of wheats and malts. The flavour is dry and bitter and tastes of raisins, malts, alcohol and caramels. It has a short aftertaste.
"
1," Its a really good beer - my favorite! Its a joy to taste the fruity beer that still taste like a beer should!
"
1," Bottle. Certainly no hiding the alcohol here, but why bother. Seems appropriate for such a full bodied beverage, lovely aroma of figs and sourdough and pretty flowers.
"
1," Bottle from Cavie.  Brown pour with an off-white head.  Aroma is pungent, a little sour, fruity, and almost woody.  Taste is dry, bitter chocolate, fruit, and musty caramel.
"
1," Bottle at Pauls tasting.  Pours brown with a medium sized tanned beige head.  Fuzzy malt, toast, roast, chocolate and char.  Smells sour and infected, slightly medicinal. Tastes infected as well, old toast, funky paper flavors.  Pretty gross.
"
1," bottle, purchased at the former brewerys Getrnkemarkt in Ergenzingen. Clear golden colour, decent head. Nice hoppy nose. Malty background with some rather nice aromatic floral hops. Gets a bit bland, though, after a while.
"
1," Dark broen, with a brown head. Aroma is coffee, chocolate, and some dark fruit. Flavor is coffee dominated, with fruit, chocolate, and roasted malt. Body is a little too thin. A higher alcohol level would be help too. Still, very good. Thanks Jason, for this bottle.
"
1," 750ml bottle from Willow Bend Liquors (Tampa). Pours dark brown with two-finger white-tan head. Good head retention. Aroma is malt, grain, hint of sweet chocolate, earthy. Flavor is malty sweetness, complex grain, hint of molasses. FInishes quickly.
"
1," Red-brown with decent, creamy tan head / Light nose of dark caramel and malt / Light body, somewhat watery and fizzy, acidic, with fair finish / Weak flavor of burnt caramel / Poor.
"
1," Bottle from StFun, thanks Josh.  Pours a very hazy yellow with a medium white head.  Hay, off putting esters, old yeast.  Medium bodied, very nice light carbonation, but not much going on in the flavor department.  Finishes with a little bit of wheat.  Not so good.
"
1," Bottle.  this beer was excellent.  I havent had a Chimay in a while.  complex flavors of fruit with some great spice.  I could drink this every day.
"
1," Small bottle. Poured dark brown with little head that retained. Aroma and flavour is mostly of dark fruits and yeast. Smooth finish.
"
1," MAR 24, 2009 A great Monk beer that has such a wonderful full body flavor that puts just about all other beers to shame. A lite smokey scent with a great deal of fruits with a muddy pour and a darker head. My only problem s which is better Chimays blue or red label?
"
1," JAN 22, 2009 33cl bottle in a pub.	The aroma of this Chimay is like a pancake with brown sugar and a slice of banana.	There are differences with pancakes however. You shouldnt serve Chimay for your kids birthday party.
"
1," Draught. Medium gold with a large fluffy head. Aroma of citrus fruit and bread. Flavour is nicely bitter with a smooth fruit core. Pale is ling lingering bitter
"
1," pours copper.  Nice cream colored head that thins somewhat but does stay.  Does seem to have an aroma of apricots.  Medium mouthfeel.  Nicely caronated.  Tastes of malt sweetness with medium bitter with slight sour finish.  To be honest, my sample was from a store that didnt refrigerate the beer.  Who knows how long it had been sitting on a shelf.  Im sure if I had it in Belguim, Id rate it much higher.
"
1," This was my first Chimay. Great fruity, crisp flavor. Not at all far behind the bleu.
"
1," Swing top bottle from Quack-Duck, thanks! Golden color. Peach in the aroma. Grassy flavor with hints of peach and flowers. A soft soapy bitterness in the aftertaste. Just a hint of alcohol. Decent.

1," (22oz bottle, 2007 vintage)  Pours a clear amber body with a small off-white head.  Aroma of roasted malt, Belgian yeast, banana, chocolate, and caramel.  Flavor of yeast, roasted malt, caramel, chocolate, and nuts.

1," DEC 24, 2010 Bottle. Wonderful hoppy characterisitics. Fruity and spicy nose. Wonderful creamy texture, lightly sweet with fruity and spicy flavors, with dry and bitter finish. Long on the tongue. Nice complexity. Rich color and a great pour in the glass.
"
1," Red in color. Very fruity. The cork popped off and hit the ceiling. Really carbonated. Very fruity. Well balanced and pleasant. Very drinkable.
"
1," ""Chimay Red"" is not just the ""small brother"" of Chimay Blue but has qualities of its own ... it is a tick lighter, frutier (whereas Blue is rather nutty) and doesnt need long storage to get its smoothness ... the color too is lighter (a muddy brown) ... nevertheless, dont be fooled, this is a full bodied brew and a good pairing for stews and soft cheese ....	a truly great beer, worth the Chimay name ... (Chimay Grand Resrve being a legend)
"
1," JUL 31, 2004 Dark amber color with a big beige head and lots of lacing. Aroma of yeast and spices. Flavor is a little sweet, malty, fruity, acidic, and toffee.
"
1," Slightly hazy golden with medium head. Sweet fruity aroma with bready notes. Same goes for the flavor. Ends mild  bitter.
"
1," Pours dark brown, mildly cloudy with a large brown head.  Nose is plum, dates, caramel.  The flavor is more of the same, sweet at front trending toward a dry finish, lots of malt character.  Alcohol character is very important to this beer, and speeds everything along.  Vinous notes creep in toward the end.  Quite good, not my absolute favorite Belgian Strong.
"
1," Pours black as night with a very nice dark brown head.  Perfect lacing.  Aroma starts off with a lot of whiskey.  Almost too much.  Flavor is the same.  Once it warms up a bit, some other complexities come through and it really is a nicely rounded oatmeal stout.  I'd say the best oatmeal stout I've had.  Better than Sam Smiths or Youngs IMO.  If you see it, pick it up.  I'm glad I did.  Bought it at Kahn's Fine Wines in Carmel, IN just north of Indy.
"
1," FEB 19, 2003 Springfield, PA. Interesting example.  The fruit flavors are very apparent, but the natural mildness of the currants keep the sweetness in check.  These flavors blend well with the white beer base.
"
1," Bottle.  Coffee and ash aroma.  Dark brown/black color with thin tan head.  Nice slightly burnt coffee flavor with a hint of cocoa.  LIghter body.  Like an iced coffee - very pleasant but on the mild side.
"
1," Very good brew here.  Pours dark brick and cloudy into the glass, with carbonation working to replenish the quarter-inch head all the way down.  Aromas of plum and honey, and the flavor really accentuates the bouquet.  I note plum, figs, malt and a very pleasant powdered sugar contingency.  Very smooth, with a mellow warm round feeling to the palate.  There may be a slight note of alcohol to conclude the finish, but only as a nice accent.  Everything blends nicely, and its definitely one to enjoy!  Surely one of the best all-around brews out there.
"
1," Lots of banana and some good clean malt notes.  Well above average.

"
1," More of a D'anjou than a Bartlett flavor. Incredibly smooth without being too sweet. Low alcohol for a cider.
"
1," Draft at brewery.  Red-brown color with virtually no head.  Caramel and toasted, nutty aroma.  Starts off quite malty and finishes with a very pleasant lingering caramel sweetness.   Softly carbonated and a little thin compared to some other scotch ales but this is very drinkable.
"
1," Pours a amber/red color with a thick, loosely formed head and slightly malty aroma. This tasted really watered down, a very boring beer, Im not sure why its rated so highly; slightly malty, some hints of raisins and alcoholic bitterness in the end. Probably wouldnt buy again.
"
1," Attractive rich brown pour with a thin off-white head.  Very weak caramel nose, but I might have been imagining that.   Weak-sister thin caramel flavor with very mild nuttiness.  The palate is weak and disappointingly thin and watered-down.   Better choices out there in this style.

1," Malty/yeasty/bready aroma...Hazy orange/amber color with a big honecombed head and patchwork lace--nice retention...Flavor features a steady mild malt underlay with moderate hop bite and a nice spiciness that tastes of allspice and cloves...The spiciness continues into the tingly dry finish---bready overtones here as well...Body showcases the firm malt foundation, augmented by the effervescent carbonation and well-judged hop dryness.  It has a substantial mouthfeel but also has a nice buoyancy to it. In sum, this is a solid product, if not offering the rainbow of tastes and olfactory sensations of the elite Belgian offerings...Still, quite enjoyable...
"
1," 33 ml bottle from Costco in Richmond, 9/24/11			Aroma"
1," 33cl bottle, 2007. Gorgeous off-white head sits atop a hazy, thick and dark brown beer. Very fruity aromas - of dark berries and perhaps banana - with yeasty tones. Its flavours are decidedly sweet and fruity with plenty of berries and apple - often toffee apple, actually -  undertones. A sweet finish contrasts with an ever so slight bitterness. Silky on the palate, caressing the tongue with its warmth and smoothness before gliding easily down the throat. An extremely tasty, full and warming Belgian ale.
"
1," bottle. Clear yellow colour, large white head. Malty nose. Quite malty, not too sweet with some rather harsh but pleasantly aromatic hops in the finish.
"
1," Cloudy amber to brown color; creamy head. Bad aroma of warm plastic in the beginning, hiding some better aroma of caramel and hazelnuts. The flavor is quite simple, maybe too weak, with some caramel and wheat, but it has an original hazelnut touch. The final is too short.

1," Cask conditioned at Banbury Beer Fest 07. Murky brown with thin head. This was a disaster, a mish mash of flavour, it tasted like a used ash tray with a touch of cabbage to add on top. Poor.
"
1," I have to stop rating tonite, this beer tastes just like the one I just had. Did I even rinse my glass? Seriously, I think the more yeasty beers don't sit that well with me. Combine that with complex maltiness and it's a difficult quaff.
"
1," Bottle ). Aroma of figs, grapes, a slight strawberry acidity. Taste is a bit of dessert spice (cinnamon, nutmeg) cherries, strong malts (a bit roasted) good sugar presence. Solid mouthfeel long, slightly creamy, good carbonation lots of caracter. Weve got some of these aging, more vintange ratings to come.
"
1," Angelic brew, There is a lot to love with the Chimay Blue and 2001 packs it all. Gorgeous pour, thin lace, minimal head. Nice smell, with hints of oak and other earthy tones. Nice perky mouthfeel, nice bubbly snap, perfect medium body ending with a heavenly hop bitterness. This is a brew that just speaks to me, I can tear most beers apart, this is one that leaves me breathless. It's always a new experience, I get something new everytime. Kind of like a Blade Runner viewing, sure I've seen it 50 times, but it keeps me coming back like a crack-whore. Dark, woody, tinge of fruit, and a malt-hop blend like no other. It's not just a brew, but a beverage majestic, solemn and wonderous in its' existence.

1," 500mL from Perfect Pour in Elkridge, MD. The pour is a clear light golden yellow with quite a large, dense, poofy white head erupting with decent retention and fairly thick lace. Nose is void of off character- some honey and zesty citrus. Taste is mildly soapy, pretty bland with no off character. Maybe some odd candy corn and old sugar candies in there. Soapy, neutral, thin palate. A little sharp in the finish. Surprisingly not that bad.
"
1," Seems that my Chimay reviews have dissappeared for the second time!  I dont know whats going on in the database.  Regardless, I like the red best of all of the Chimay Ales.  Good body and great tangy sour wheat flavor.
"
0," JAN 7, 2008 Terrible beer, with a very strong phenolic character, not due to cloves, but due to off-flavors from wild yeast, which the brewer tried to mask by putting a heavy coating of cinnamon and sugar on the rim of the glass. The phenols come through in both the aroma and the flavor, which was also the case in other AP beers. The beer was cloudy, with a sporadic head. Cloudiness bears out the infection. Two of us split ~a 10 oz pour, and we could not finish it. On top of that, we were charged $12 for this minuscule pour. The claim is that this price is due to the high alcohol level, which is EXTREMELY unlikely. Based on palate considerations, it is likely less than 10%, this is just a poorly made beer that the brewer is making excuses for.
"
1," dark malts, brown candis, alcohol, dark dried fruits, slightly sour. Unharmonic but massive due to to high alcohol. There are better trappists.
"
1," The 750 ml bottle poured in a Chimay chalice hazy amber brown with a small of white head that turns quickly to lace. Yeasty and apricot aromas are present in the glass along with sweet malt as well. Nice carbonation on the tongue with medium body. Flavors are really complex blend of malt, yeast, caramel, dried fruits (dates, raisins), citrus (orange, lemon), some spiciness, and a hint of hops in the finish .To me this is a good Dubbel and a great accompaniment to my meal of American Chop Suey if I dont say so myself
"
1," Sampled on cask while at the brewpub. Poured with a hazy dark orange body. Aroma of flowers and light citrus. Also some caramel. The taste had bread brust and light honey. Decent IPA.
"
1," Bottle. Vintage 2004. Pours a fine clear pale golden yellow with no apparent bubbles. Head is initially big white and foamy, but quickly ends up as a then white head. Aroma is sweet and malty with a slight fruity note. Flavour is equally sweet with a slight caramel and hoppy note.
"
1," Aroma from yeast and smoke.	Champagneish and smoky palate.	Prune-flavour.
"
1," Draught at Siboire. Nice lasting white foam.	Clear yellow color. Big Belgian aroma with peach seeds, phenols and almonds. Big complex taste with some sweetness and plesent bitterness. Medium to big body.
"
1," Dark copper pour with off white head creamy little bit of lacing sediment in the glass after pour aroma of dried fruits  ... fruit and malt flavor with a little bite at the end slight taste of caramel , creamy and little dry finish.... very good balanced beer... Thank God for Monks
"
1," Pours light brown. Extremely nutty, and a little too sweet with toasted malts.
"
1," redish, or lighter brown in color.  Smelled of fruit and as usual with Chimay, plenty of carbonation.  A great beer but not the best of the chimay line.
"
1," Basic and average, with your run of the mill sweaty musty aroma.  Full of acidic grapefuits and tangerines.  Some light banana, overall unimpressive.
"
1," (650ml bottle) Purchased at Spinnakers Wine Merchants in Vic West. Standard orange body with a creamy, beige head. Nose is all Cinnamon and nutmeg. Cloying and overly gingerbread. Whatever happened to a ""winter warmer"" being 7% ABV and containing some complexity? This is a 5% ABV introduction to girlie beers to be had during the non-Raspberry ale spritzer months. Pretty disappointing.
"
1," Wildly popular but not a great Big River beer.  I am surprised it has rated so low despite its popularity but that makes me think that us at ratebeer know wheat were talking about and have some consensus!   In the Sam Adams style but lighter on the malt appealing to the masses.
"
1," Nice dark brown color. Sweet maltiness and light hop taste. Nice mouthfeel but I only wanted one.
"
1," Very nice appearance. Had a blackish brown look. Flavor was nutty and pleasant. Wasnt overowering. Nice beer.

"
1," Golden colour with an off white head. Malty aroma with bread notes and a light apple fruityness. Malty, light sour flavor with a dry finish.
"
1," A very good beer.  Nice malty aroma, with some alcohol.  The mouthfeel is great.  My favorite Chimay beer is the Red, but this is a very close second.
"
1," decaturstevos Febmergency Tasting.  Sample from a bottle thanks to decaturstevo.  Pale orange with a thin white head.  Grapefruit hop aroma.  Sweet caramel malt with a big bitter spice, herbal and citrus finish.
"
1," Bottle. A mahogany colour with a tanned (small bubbly) head. The aroma of sweet, fruity. The carbonation is good. It has a medium sweer taste, a little boozy. A beer that met my expectations
"
1," Bottle at Sokol. Hazy golden colour with a thin white head. Malty and floral hoppy aroma. Malty flavour with nice grassy and fruity hops, some bread and herbs. Medium to full-bodied. Very tasty brew.
"
1," Bottle, danke Martin! Golden, low head. Light bready, sweet malt and flowery nose. Honeyisih entry, light perfumed hops. Medium body, light sparkly. Fat aftertaste. Flowers retronasal.
"
1," Bottle from Big Ridge Liquor Store, SurreyAmber color; medium sized head. Aroma of gingerbread cookies (dry, not sweet), hazelnuts and light cinnamon. The body is weak; some (dryish) caramel flavor, but well blended with delicate Christmas spices. Simple, at least not excessive as other Christmas beers.
"
1," 50 cL bottle. Pours hazy orange with a small white head. Aroma is dry estery and wheaty. Sweet and light fruity flavoured, slight banana and oranges. Dry phenolic note into a dry wheaty finish.
"
1," Poured a beautiful deep copper color.  Nice fruity/malty aroma, with a full body feel.  Nice long lasting head.  Full of great flavor.  I've had this plenty of times, just never rated it before.  One of the best.

1," Glasflasche
"
1," This beer has a very complex, interesting flavor.  Right away it becomes apparent that the people at Chimay know exactly what theyre doing. The beer has a long lasting finish that is actually enjoyable.
"
1," Dripping with resinous hops, this IPA packs a surprisingly bitter punch, wringing every last west coast IBU from the recipe.  The malts give a grainy, meek background, one barely noticeable in the face of such massive piney massiveness.  Good nose, even with a hint of metallic ick.  The texture isnt that great-- the beer seems overcarbonated and spiky, too harsh when coupled with a sandpaper-dry finish.  Good but one is plenty.
"
1," Bottle courtesy of lewis13. Pours a cloudy orange-amber with a kajillion tiny little floaties and an average size off-white head. Aroma has a nice balance of citrus and pine hops and sweet malt. Simple flavour of hops and caramel malt, a bit of fruit and a quick bitter finish -- easy to drink and refreshing. Medium bodied. Good stuff.
"
1," This brew poured a large head of fine to medium sized off-white mostly lasting bubbles that left behind no lacing and a hazy light amber brown colored body behind.  It had a malty wheat bread like aroma and a banana flavor with corriander and orange notes.  Its mouthfeel was smooth.  This brew goes down very easily and is a very good example of a typical witbier like flavor.
"
1," Thanks to BBB63 for this.  At time of sample, it is only a month and a half old and was refridgerated the entire time.  The beer pours to a thin brown body with a super fizzy tan head.  The aroma is strange woods and light roasted malts and isnt especially good.  Not certain if it has spoiled but signs sorta indicate yes.  The flavor is dry roasted malts, wood, and nothing especially good.
"
1," Enjoyed on tap at the brewpub.  Reddish colour, some decent bitterness, with a mineral edge.  Not bad, hits the amrk of the style.
"
1," 12 oz bottle from acknud; thanks!!! Nose of lemony hops, light malt, and a background fruitiness; cloudy orange with a big straw head, heavily lacing the glass; flavor has moderate hop bitterness, with a light caramel malt background and some light lemony bitterness for a finish!
"
1," Found this at Sunnys restaurant Bangalore.  Served in the Chimay glass.  Nice head and odours of raisins.  Mildly sweet and has this dry finish that I love.  Excellent beer.
"
1," Yeasty doughy Dubbel. Not much of a head. Although I liked it I will stick to the blue.
"
1," Cloudy yellow, dense, smooth head. Smells crisp and clean, like a sea breeze (not like Sea Breeze, the facial cleaner). Smooth notes of banana and some hints of a hoppy bate. Goes well with fish tacos.
"
1," Bottle. Hazy pale amber coloured with a medium sized head. Nice and malty with notes of bread, grass and a slight fruity hint. Very refreshing.
"
1," Fantastic nice tripple fermented beer, really nice full bodied dark  hoppy flavour.  Really complex beer, that I could drinks heaps of, especially because the ABV is masked very well.
"
1," I am not sure if I can add any more superlatives that havent already been said other than to say this beer may be the definition of ""world class"".
"
1," pours dark brown with a foamy tan head.  notes of chocolate, coffee, subtle bourbon. bittersweet with a Very smooth,sticky, slightly creamy mouthfeel.  Overall a pretty tasty, easy drinkin, stout. I would get this again.
"
1," Amber colour, creamy off-white head. Aroma of sour fruits. Flavour has sour fruits as well, with biscuit malts and glue. Sour finish.
"
1," Carolina Crew gathering! Thanks to JCB via the Indy crew for this one!  I really enjoyed this!  Clear garnet pour with a tan head and minimal lace.  Aroma of candi sugar and dark fruits.   Full bodied.  Sweet caramel, molasses, candi sugar, and dark fruits (mostly fig) A tad hot on the finish, but nothing overwhelming.
"
1," Bottle.  At first smell I noticed hints of clove, banana, and yeast.  Beer is a dark ruby red/brown that is cloudy.  Pours a thick head that diminishes into about a 1/4"" head.    Tastes pretty damn good.  I started to wonder why people liked trappist ales until I had this one.   Refreshing for a beer that is 9%.  Hints of banana and clove finishing with a bit of malt.  The alcohol is apparent after the tastes hit you.  Overall this is an excellent beer.!
"
1," I had the opportunity of having this aged 2 years and let me tell you it was like drinking the beer of the gods.
"
1," Bottled (thanks fonefan!). Golden colour, small white head. Aroma is banana, sweet malts, some mild earthy and herbal notes. Also kind of wheatlike sweetness lurking. Flavour is sweet malts, some mild bananaish notes as well as some earthyness.
"
1," It is another classic.  I find it difficult to dislike these Trappist ales.  Such complex yet refreshing flavors exist in this one.  Lots of fruitiness but it does not go overboard with the fruitiness.  the richness of the malt complements the fruit flavors wonderfully and the high carbonation keeps the flavors dancing on the tongue throughout the tasting experience.
"
1," not the best wit I have had but not bad. aroma and flavor are light banana , clove, and spice. a little bit sweet and some descent head and lacing. a  little light in the body but overall a nice summer drinker.
"
1," Enjoyed on tap at the brewpub.  A decent drinking beer.  A bit of bitterness but also unfortunatley some dishwater taste in this one.  Light golden colour, with a touch of white head, it is lacey and fresh.  The odd taste is not apparent in the aroma.
"
1," Didnt like this one as much as other people on here. Scored nice for taste. Not my style i think.
"
1," Dark red brown color true to the style.  The aroma was wheat and other cereal grains, yeast, vague plum fruitiness.  The flavor was wheat, spicy, fruity.  The finish had a mild bitterness.  Relatively thick mouthfeel.  Good beer overall.
"
1," A hazy amber beer with a disappearing sparkly head. The aroma is sweet malty with strong notes of apples. The flavor is slightly sour and dominated by apples, as if it is a cider, the end is dry.
"
1," Reddish brown pour with a fine looking light tan head. Very fruity aroma. Apricot, peach,  apple with a mild yogurty sweetness. The flavor is  yeastier. Also more bread and caramel, but still quite fruity. The finish is very clean and dry, almost surprisingly so, and rounds the rich flavor out nicely. Very good, very drinkable beer.
"
1," Smokey and slightly bitter, ashy notes. Bitter chocolate and coffee. Pitch black with tan head.
"
1," Very nice.  Yeasty with a touch of fruitiness.  Good, not my favorite trappist, but still worth a try
"
1," I know Im in the minority in preferring the Rouge to the Bleu, but obviously were only talking about degrees of excellence here.  Gorgeous color; head was not particularly dense--i.e. larger bubbles.  Carbonation was striking in the palate--champagne-like tingles, more than to my taste.  Aroma was the let-down; not as rich as expected or as the flavor ultimately held.  The smoothness of the beer is striking--complex flavors, mild sweetness, some spice (nutmeg perhaps)--but all without being hit on the head by any of them.  It went down very fast, which is unfortunate considering the high alcohol, which hit very quickly after just 200ml!  (2002 vintage, .33L bottle)
"
1," Cloudy and murky with bits of goodness floating around.thin to no head after initial pour. Fruit taste turns to malt then hops. Raisin or dates. I like all the Chimay offerings.
"
1," Bottle. Chestnut brown with a rich, creamy offwhite head. Sweet caramel aroma with some spicy hoppiness. Flavours start sweet, but with well-balanced bitterness. Flowery hop flavours. Warming alcohol, full body, good carbonation. A well-made craft beer that lacks a little punch.
"
1," A strong scent of fruit - prune/raisin, apple, banana etc. - Very pleasant roasted nose with a hint of malty sweet. Brun and cloudy with a beige long sustained froth. A nice taste of fruit, sweet liquorice and caramel. Taste strong but with sweetness.
"
1," Nutty malt aroma with some grape like fruit aroma. Brown color with a medium tan head. Big malty flavor with a moderate carbonation bite in the finish.
"
1," Black with some tan head. Sour nose with underlying wood and coffee.  Sour cherry and syrup taste was balanced by vanilla and creamy chocolate, all the while retaining the woody dryness. Alcohol completely masked.  Bitter at the finish with sour berry aftertaste. More vanilla.
"
1," Edinburgh beer festical 2007 ... Deep red black ... light malt nose ... lots of roast and fruity malts ... little dandylion and burdoch ... little blackcurrent ... little bitter in roast linger.
"
1," great strong ale.  had this at Le Mouton d Or with a good grilled fish.  manager poured me a free one to get me going.  i floated out of that place, nearly scaled city hall and yelled to everyone in the square that ""I love Euros"".  careful with this brew.
"
1," What else can be said.  Overpriced for my blood.  Gimme' three Ommegangs for the price.
"
1," Skyview V, 11/11/11.  Courtesy of JK.  Dark orange color.  Light fruit and spice aroma.  Dry, grainy flavor.  Heavy carbonation.  Light spiciness towards the finish.
"
1," Only one beer comes close to the Chimay Premiere.  Thats the Chimay Blue.  The aroma, the color, the taste.  I cannot begin to explain my love for this beer.  Its a sit down, smoke a cigar and enjoy type beer.  It can be enjoyed at room temperature, however, I prefer it pretty darn cold.  Great with strong cheeses, stews, and nuts.
"
1," perfect ale.
"
1," Mahogony in color.  Very tasty.  Lacks the body of some of the other trappists, including the blue.
"
1," Botteled. Dark ruby color. thin tast with a hint of something I cant put a name to. Notthing special
"
1," MAY 27, 2008 Pours a brown color with a tan head that fizzes like  champagne and dissipates quite quickly.  Nose is somewhat like red wine with distinct floral and fruity notes.  Taste is fruity, like red grapes and plumbs and tart.  Finish is tart and slightly bitter and fairly long lasting.  This is probably the best known, but it is definately NOT the best *tasting* Abbey Dubbel.  Ive had several that were much better.
"
1," Light brown with tan head.Great malt nose. Malty from beginning to end. Great Belgian lace
"
1," Bottle. Pours a lively reddish brown, sedimented and well carbonated. Off white head that is nice and firm, fading to a light skim on the top. Nose is very light of fruit, some faint hops and a bit metallic. Taste is very nice, almost in 2 separate parts - a sweetness followed by a light bitter, with some coffee in there. Light finish. Very refreshing.
"
1," Bottle, 750 ml.  An amazing beer.  Having first loved the red, as this is my brothers favorite, I now insist he gets me a blue label when buying Chimay!  I was impressed to find it at the only bar in the Manchester, NH air port.
"
1," Bottle 2010. Chimay Bleue is hazy brown coloured beer with long lasting small foamy, off-white head. Belgian yeasty fruity aroma is a bit alcoholic. Very malty taste stays long time and has a bitter ending. Full bodied, greatly balanced classic.
"
1," Silky smooth, foamy crown that lingers on, decent if weak aroma of yeast & pale spring flowers. Medium body, slightly watery palate. In my book the weakest of the Chimay Tricolor.
"
1," Oh I finally tried a Chimay, this was delicious.  Smells and tastes vaguely of its high alcohol content.  Quite dark, heavy, good head, Chocolate and spice, very nice.  My family was kind of questioning my taste when I gave them a sip, but hey...and half the bottle exploded in their fridge, what a shame!
"
1," OCT 14, 2003 2001 version. I have been looking forward to trying this one for quite awhile (thanks Linc!). Definitely worth the wait. Chimay Red is a real letdown compared to this. This isn't the best beer I have ever had but it is definitely up there. I only wish I had a fancy goblet to drink these Belgian ales in. Healthy, lively head over an earthy dark brown beer. Fruit, caramel and toffee in the aroma. As with the Westy, the flavor seemed to morph as I drank it, something like liquid Grape Nuts. The flavor came out more and more as it warmed, so the beer got even better as I drank it. A true classic.
"
1," Pour is a black with a tan head.  Aroma is dark chocolate, toffee and coffee.  Flavor is roasty and smooth.  Some chocolate and coffee.  Pretty good oatmeal stout.
"
1," 75cL bottle, from old notes.  Deep brown in color with rich tan foam, decent retention and great lacing.  Notes of rum soaked raisins and brown sugar in the aroma.  Flavor is big on the rich malts, little bit of overripe fruit in there with the standard Chimay bitterness in the finish.  Without a doubt, a benchmark for the style.
"
1," strange, but not bad, aroma, with as sharp after taste
"
1," Enjoyable. I had ""Chimay Premiere"" in one of the large bottles, splitting half ot it with a friend. It was enjoyable, strong, very drinkable, though inferior to Chimay Blue in my opinion.
"
1," Bottle. Cloudy yellow, creamy white head. Orangepeel and light fermented banana aroma. Dry clove intro, fruits are still there, a light licorice note I think,light candyish banana notes in the exit. Dry medium body, sparkly mouthfeel. Nice..
"
1," A deep, dark chestnut body with a thick beige head; sweet caramel aroma; full in the mouth, predominantly malty, but with traces of caramel and nut. Very clean, long warming finish.
"
1," bottle, thank you Frankenland. Clear brown colour, fluffy beige head. Shy aroma of roasetd malt. The flavours are very shy, too. Hints of caramel and roasetd malt, but quite thin. Not bad, but the flavours could be much more intensive.
"
1," Umber color with hints of garnet when held to the light. Modest, but stable beige head. Grainy aromas with hints of DMS. Some toasted to lightly roasted malts as well in the scent. Light malt sweetness with a touch of toasted biscuits. Herbal hops kick in the middle. Some earth dry malt flavors also come out in the finish and linger. Slightly unclean, but fairly drinkable brown.
"
1," Hazy reddish brown, yeasty, malty, darkfruits, creamy, spicey, caramel, dry finish.
"
1," Bottle. Tasted blind @ yespr. Pours a hazy golden color with a small off-white head. Has a sweetish malty spicy yeasty aroma. Sweetish fruity malty spicy yeasty flavor. Has a sweetish fruity malty spicy yeasty finish.
"
1," A very red beer, barely brown, with a dense, tan head that laces well down the glass.  Aroma of bakers chocolate and caramel with a touch of warm fermented fruitiness but lacking complexity.  Flavor and aroma are one with the addition of a nice, long bitterness and hop flavor that extends the finish and some milk on the palate.  It seems a little thin for an American brown ale, not very complex, but I know how hard it is to brew this style of beer and include complexity.  It has a great drinkability.
"
1," Growler from STFUN....I hate to do this but I have to bash this beer....Aroma was ok, hops smelled a little different for an DIPA. Taste was a thin syrup like medice taste. Just plain bad...I wasnt the only one who thought that. I shared it with four other people and they all said the same thing. Low carbonation. Over all a drain pour.... Which kind of upsets me since Josh worked so hard to get me this beer. Maybe it was a bad growler. I will have to re-rate if I ever go visit Indiana...Thanks Josh for going beyond the call of duty to get this beer for me!
"
1," DEC 14, 2005 2005 version.  Hazy amber beer with a thin white head.  Aroma is very spicy, nutmeg, cinnamon, plummy/pudding-like malts.  Light toffee and faint diacetyl, but it actually works with all of these sweet malts.  Spices tend to come across a bit astringent and harsh.  Lingering sweetish finish.		2004 version.  Dark brown beer with a thick tan head.  Sweet bready malt aroma.  Warming spices, a big trace of biscuity aroma and sweet fruits.  A touch of ginger.  Slight toasty flavour and aroma.  Aroma gives the impression of root beer.   Dusty yeast flavour, long sweet finish.  Quite good.	7/3/7/4/14
"
1," From a 33cl bottle from Picks Liquors poured into my Chimay Trappist glass. This beer pours a light brown/ruby. It has a full inch of head that is a dark white color and lasts and lasts. Has a slight smell of caramel and fig. Taste is malty like a fresh baked loaf of bread. It is slightly sweet and slightly bitter. Very good amount of carbonation. Finish is dry and abrupt. Overall, I dislike this beer. I feel that it is the very worst of the Chimay brand. I will not be buying this beer again.
"
1," Excellent beer. Good with food. I guess the best thing I can say about this beer is that it has found the perfect bitter... this thing has crazy good hops.
"
1," Very fruity and bubbly.  Tasty, but not near the perfection of the blue.
"
1," has a very odd, meaty smell.  after sipping it for a while, i was hoping it was a beer and not a gravy...
"
1," Draught, Seven Bridges, JacksonvilleDark brown.  Chocolatey aroma.  Light body is nice and creamy.  Not a ton of flavour beyond the most basic dark malt profile.  Disappointing.
"
1," The last of many beers at Big River on Saturday night. I didnt finish it and wasnt very impressed. It felt stale and malty. It also took forever to come out as the waitress was in the weeds all night. Im probably not being fair, but I dont get the good reviews on this beer. It was flat and not worth the calories.
"
1," Deep amber colour.  Dry nutty flavour.  Medium bodied.  Unimpressive.
"
1," Bottle. Murky brown with big bubbled unstable head. Heavy, sweet, , phenolic aroma leading to a sweet one dimensional flavor. Lacks the chocolate/nut character of other weizenbocks. Not bad, just too sweet and uncharacteristic for me.
"
1," (bottle) pours a clear pale yellow colour with a frothy white head. aroma of floral hops and lavender, with some pale malts and distinct notes of honey. flavour is very grassy, with some light notes of barnyard and a grainy finish. medium body and carbonation.
"
1," Draught at brewery. Gold pour, light head and lace. Light corn and grain nose. A little cereal and grain flavor. Watery body. Not great.
"
1," A good strong ale but I feel that it is definitely overrated and over priced. There are many that I like as well or better for less money.
"
1," So so... but a good filler round.  Commercial Street, Vancouver.  Not much to speak of.  yay.
"
1," Very, very nice. Pours to a very full body. Smells of caramel and alcohol. A little resin in the glass. I just wish I could afford it every evening.
"
1," Light brown with a fluffy tan head. Spicy, flowery hop aroma with some roasted malts. Tastes of sweet roasted malts, chocolate and nuts. Great mild bitter chocolate finish.
"
1," 750ml bottle. An old standby and for good reason. Pours dark brown with a tiny head. Aroma and flavor of fruits, malts, and caramel with maybe a hint of chocolate. Awesome on the palate with a smooth medium body and a nice fizzy carbonation. Always a good choice and definitely the best of the three flagship Chimays.
"
1," Pours dark brown with a faint white head, aroma of spices, sweet malty taste with undetectable hops, strong spiciness with a zesty finish, and a lot of carbonation. Nothing special -- Chimay Rouge has a much better flavor balance.
"
1," Bottle (50 cl swing-top) purchased at Toom Getrnkemarkt, Wrzburg, Germany. Hazy orange golden, medium white head. Fresh bready malt aroma with grassy hops. Light to medium bodied, medium carbonation. Well balanced with a dry finish and a mild bitterness.
"
1," 330ml bottle.  Strong, quite strong.  It was fantastic, but deffinately has a strong alcoholic taste.  Even with that I enjoyed it a great deal.
"
1," I keep coming back to this one.  A classic.  nice full body and champagne carbonation.  Raisins, malt, dark fruits...  Very nice strong ale.
"
1," FEB 8, 2006 Very good, althoug a little foam after a short period of time. I like its smoked flavor. The aroma is great.
"
1," APR 11, 2008 11.2 ounce bottle-  now I know why monks are so happy!  This ale poured a dark golden brown, with the appropriate cloudiness.  Aroma was thick malt.  Head was perfect, foamy and lasted the full glass.  That really wasnt very long with this wonderful ale.  Savoring this brew was like postponing orgasm, a theory at best.  It is a good thing that this beer is fairly pricey, lest the Fat Man become addicted.  Get some, now.
"
1," omhper in Montreal #15 (with MartinT,tiggmtl,Rastacouere,DYCSoccer).  Plastic (500 ml?) bottle provided by Per...an amazing gift (burs version).  Bright pale orange, no carbonation...smoky, funky cheeses and fruitwoods in the nose, wildy woody and farmy...simply fantastic aromas!  Very flat, smoky peaches and apricots in the flavor...the thin body allows the heavy smokiness and charred character to overwhelm.  Difficult to drink even a small sample, nonetheless its really amazing to be able to try this!
"
1," 11.2 oz bottle. great color and aroma. Tasted a little similiar to other belgians with the spices but i prefer the rochefort and bernardus. Also, had a slightly strong alcohol taste towards the end. This is still a great beer though.
"
1," Bottle at SBWF. Characteristic orange color with a decent white foam. Tropical fruits found in the aroma and taste but it was not an explosion of them.		Nah, it was quite a bit anonymous still drinkable.
"
1," JUL 26, 2008 Rerate, 330 ml bottle, now available in Norway (Vinmonopolet, + Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger)"
1," Typical brown ale with an accentuated sense of smokiness.  The palate is too thin for real enjoyment--it didnt tingle or glow on the tongue--and it slips into nothingness.  Still, it was drinkable and an easy beer to not find annoying.  Sessionable.
"
1," Bottle.	Nice firm white head. Good malty aroma. I was expecting more fruitiness. Perhaps I should let it warm up. Copper color is faded by the yeast sediment I poured into the glass.  A very nice Belgian Dubbel.
"
1," Dark, nearly opaque, brown with a light head. Aroma is of hops and yeast, flowery soap?. Alcohol doesnt really come through in the fairly well balanced flavor, could be mistaken for 5-6% easily, but starts to kick-in afterwards. Decent, but nothing special.
"
1," Cask conditioned	handpump	GBBF 2011.  A golden beer with an off-white head.  Sharp grassy hops.  A very bitter taste.  A bit of smoky fart.  Hops are obvious but dont work.  Does try though.
"
1," Poured a dark muddy color. Tasted amazing, Delish. Nice bite and great carbination. Loved it. Thanks monks.
"
1," Belgian Strong Ale"" tasting 07 results.  Nice white head on amber body.  Aroma is light malty, with that nice belgium yeast aroma.  Moderate sweetness hits you at first and sticks through the finsh, in my notes also noted salty, I dont know why, I want to rerate simply for that reason.  Palate was medium and dry, very enjoyable.  Not bad.
"
1," 750ml bottle. Semi-hazy light amber with a frothy white head. Flakes of suspended yeast (prior to yeast pour). Musty yeast aroma with honey, tropical fruit and some herby spiciness. Bubbly body at first with a good dose of coriander, ginger, yeast and light candied sugar. Watery body beneath the bubbles. Nice flavor just lacks malt depth. Adding the immense amount of yeast made this less palatable. Too yeasty and mushy for me in the end. Could use a lot of aging or maybe a pour without the 1/2 of yeast.
"
1," Dark red body with a thick foamy head thats last pretty long and shrinks to a thin layer of foam. Aroma is of plums and dried fruits, little yeasty and a strong sour smell.	Flavor is of dried fruits and plums, was very sourish in the begingin but that disapeard when it warmed up.	Palate is thin.
"
1," Very dark burgundy or red in colour. Aroma is masked by a thick biege head. Wonderful flavour which can only be described as sour floral. Fantastic beer.
"
1," Clear golden with a medium white head. Malty nose with hints of hops. Malty flavour with hints of grassy hops. Finished dry and bitter.
"
1," TheDM and Hotstuff vacation brew 47.  This draft brew was enjoyed at the brewery in Saint Augustine Florida.  This brew poured a small head of fine to medium sized mostly diminished bubbles that left behind a semi opaque dark brown colored body with no visible carbonation.  It had a very mild malt aroma and a thin palate with a thin malt flavor that contain just a little dark malt in it.  It needed more.
"
1," I tasted this beer before I got my account with ratebeer, so I cant really remember all the flavors.
"
1," A fairly good Belgian. Full of flavor, whether it be from the hops (theres a lot of them) or from the malts ( this runs high). Its a decent Belgian.
"
1," Golden coloured and clear. Has no head. Heavy fruity aroma, apples, sugars. Flavor is heavy to harsh sweet, more fruit. Some acid too. Astringent. No carbonation. Syrupy texture.
"
1," A clear golden orange beer with a small white head.  The aroma is malt, corn, and grass.  The flavor is slightly sweet corn and fruity hops.  Very thin body, not a terrible lager.
"
1," Pale gold thin white cap, looks like a normal lager to me. Wet hay with mild skunk, hints of lime but not as much as i was expecting. When warmer aroma turns sweeter and more limey but still nothing great. Aroma is underwhelmingly dull but probably the best lime beer Ive ever smelt. Taste has a fizzy pop like quality. Corn with hay no signs of the pepper, hints of lime. Lime is perfect really not over powering and not fake tasting.  light and drinkable, nice tiny bubble carbonation. High quality for what it is really, but not a beer Ill ever really completely enjoy. And why is this in the winter sampler pack and not the summer yard work pack.
"
1," Good crisp taste with a fruitness closely matching bananas.  Nice amount of carbonation and froth makes me think this would be an excellent beer for a hot summer night.  Also, crazy alcoholic.
"
1," This bottle was in Marts 05, when I tasted it, out of date by the end of 07, so it was pretty young. It has a nice, creamy head, a beautiful mahogany color and a fruity aroma. The mouthfeel is semi-oily and the flavour is sweet and has the characteristic Chimay taste and notes of fruit. The bitterness is light, but OK and the alcohol is still too dominant in this young beer.
"
1," Bottled. Amber with a good dash or red. Cherry and plum aroma, fruity sweetness. Lovely full texture on the palate, sort of scraps the outsides of your tongue on the way down. Not overly sweet which is a good thing.
"
1," pours with a nice head.  lovely fruity, woody aromas.  burnt sugar, raisins and big maltiness.  very tasty.
"
1," Despite having tried this beer in the past, I hadn't rated it, which means I hadn't had it in the 13+ months I'd been here.  So I picked up a bottle, half expecting that my ""matured"" palate would end up treating this as an also-ran, perhaps an ""accessible"" Trappist beer.  Accessible it may be, but even still, it's a damn fine beer!  The body is a beautiful hazy chestnut, topped by a small tan head.  The aroma is Belgian yeasty, medium sweet, malty, with just a slight hint of spice.  Tastewise, it's mildly sweet, yeasty, malty, and lightly spiced.  Very well-balanced.  It's got a big body -- definitely for sipping, not for gulping.  Even still, the mouthfeel is light, no doubt owing to the flood of carbonated bubbles that touch your tongue on contact.
"
1," This is slightly better than the Southern Flyer Light.
"
1," 12 oz. bottle courtesy of a trade with BBB63.  Pours a hazy amber with a thin linen white head that faded to a ring after two sips.  Very light aroma of grassy hops.  The flavor is mostly grassy hops with virtually no malt.  This flavor is short-lived and the beer finishes bitter and tasteless, much like the white pith of an orange.  The bitterness lingers on the palate for a bit after the swallow.  Not very good.
"
1," Floral, honey, earth, lavender hops with underlying biscuity, toasty malts in the nose.  Clear copper coloured body is topped by a low white head that diminishes to partial cover with light lacing.  Moderate hop bitterness with floral, lavender hop flavour over a clean malt character.  Medium body with fair carbonation and soft bubbles in the mouth.  Bottle enjoyed with Oakes, Rastacouere, St-Eric and Ungstrup.
"
1," Tasted 8/11/10. Sampler from the Brewpub. Relatively dark and opaque. Thick ring of khaki head. Aromas of dark chocolate, anise and maple. Full bodied with similar flavors of dark chocolate and subtle coffee notes. Good use of the wood. Really adds a dimension to the flavors and palate. Subtle cola sweetness in the malt bill. Rich and thick and great drinking! Delicious!
"
1," Bottle 50 cl. Courtesy of yespr. Hazy amber golden with floating impurities and a dense, off-white head. Sweetish malty and slightly fruity nose. Medium-bodied with roasted malty accents and some flowery hoppiness. Dry and lightly bitter finish. A nice one. 141208
"
1," Golden coloured, medium-sized fluffy head; herbal, grassy hoppy aroma, some malty notes; low carbonated, sweetish-malty taste; very light hoppiness in the lasting caramelly, malty aftertaste. Quaffable, not overwhelming.
"
1," Its aight.  Crushed with a couple of mos.  Lots of dark fruit notes as a good quad should have.  Interesting hops in the finish are both strange, disconcerting, yet somewhat pleasant.  Barrel adds another interesting sweetness to the brew.  Cant put my finger on what I think about this one, but its interesting, original, and drinkable.  Cool.
"
1," Served from a 12 oz bottle from Crown in Indy. The appearance is a rich chocolate brown with a medium frothy medium brown head. The aromas are mild with oatmeal, oak, and whiskey. The flavors are grainy with oatmeal and rye forward and whiskey in the after taste. The oak flavors have a rawness to them and dirty tone (not negatives) and a spice. Some wet coffee grinds too. The mouth is medium to full bodied with a tighter fizzier carbonation. I got to say this one grew on my quite nicely. A touch mellow but raw and tasty.
"
1," Very full voluminous lasting head with tiny nitrous like bubbles that give this beer a sparkling mouthfeel.  The color is like an old penny... beautiful.  The aroma is a little subtle but fruity malt and a little yeast...  Flaor is mild for it's style but pleasing.  I like the rusty taste in the head.  Apples and berrys... with a bitter finish.  Very nice to my mouth.
"
1," Bottle. Pours a pale golden, with a small white head. Aroma is of malts, and hops. Taste is hoppy, lightly sweet, and malts
"
1," 05/09 bottle drank from a wine glass at azwine 1/22/10.		opens with a pop.		hazy pour. red-orange shade of warm brown with a pillowy khaki/tan head. soft spotty lacing lines the inside of the glass. 		beautiful perfume aroma... lots of brown sugar, tons of yeast, banana-y esters, malt, light cinnamon-y spicy numbing. 		the palate is rich and malty though not sweet. characteristics of the aroma match the flavor along with the additions of chocolate, brioche and raisins. it is subtle, well controlled and insanely glorious.		smooth medium body is aided by sudsy carbonation and a crisp clean mouth feel. 		8.5/5/8.5/4/18/4.4
"
1," Tap.  Fragrant floral hop aroma.  Pours copper with a thin white head and spotty lacing.  Hoppy flavor with a dry floral hop finish.  Medium bodied and refreshing.
"
1," An unclear red-brown beer with a huge light brown head. The aroma is quite simple, sweet wheaty with slight notes of caramel, and hints of dust. The flavor is sweet wheaty with notes of caramel, nuts, and oranges. The alcohol is more felt than tasted, but it definately lingers in the background.
"
1," This is a dark brownish-gold Belgian, with a thin cappuccino head. It smells like fig, caramel, candy sugar, cherries and yeast, which may sound odd but is actually captivating. Unsurprisingly, theres a lot of candy sugar in the taste, as well as roses, plums, molasses, and nutty malt.
"
1," Draft - Nashville. Beautiful Deep Amber collor with white head. Flavor is weak, aroma the same. Tasted like water supply had too much chlorine.
"
1," Deep brown coloured with a foamy off white head. Nice dark fruity caramel malty aroma with clear alcoholic-yeasty touches. Full body, little sweeter. Finish is sweet caramel like with an alcoholic touch. This is a top beer.
"
1," (draft) Clear copper body with off-white head.  Aroma is sweet, caramel, butty, faint peat.  Taste is medium sweet, caramel, some nutty, peat.  Medium body, some sticky. (cask) Hazy copper with off-white head.  Aroma is medium sweet, caramel, grapefruit.  Taste is medium sweet, grapefruit, caramel.  Light-medium body.
"
1," Hazy brown body with a foamy lasting off-white head. Aroma is sweet of berries, malt and fruit. Flavor is roasted malt, yeast and some liquorice. A little mild in the flavor but still a nice beer!
"
1," Had at a random bar near the hotel at my brothers wedding in Indianapolis.  Not too bad, but nothing special.
"
1," Tap Rockbottom (Atlanta) - Deep chestnut brown, thin creamy off-white head.  Nose was mellow with notes of milk chocolate, toffee nut, and florals.  Chocolate notes and floral hops blend well to maintain balance.  Light bodied, medium carbonation, soft bittersweet finish.  Not my thing, but it was alright to give whirl
"
1," Tasted 30/09/2005.  330ml bottle at Hummingbird.	Dark brown offering with an off-white, creamy, head.  Strong lacing.  Aroma is an absolute stunner - sweetness hints at port, on the very first sniff, but then turns out to be more like a rich, whisky-drenched, fruit cake.  Yeasty, fruity, caramelised, alcohol-laden.  Flavour is mostly sweet with more dryness, than real bitterness. The medium-mouthfeel and soft carbonation is very smooth.  A classy beer for either contemplative reflection or jubilation.
"
1," Gold color. Lightly spiced fruity hop nose.Faint orange and spicy flavor with dry finish. Dont care much for it.
"
1," damn...
"
1," Pours almost black with some red highlights.  Small active head is dark brown and almost black in places.  Nose is chocolate, roasted nut, and milk.  Feel is silky smooth and tongue is stimulated in waves of locations.  Flavors of chocolate, coffee, metal, bourbon, wood, and molasses.  Flavor is a bit muted but this is a beer that offers a wide variety of tastes.
"
1," This beer isnt very complex in my opinion but it has a very good taste. This beer is certanly one of my favourites!
"
1," Final one to try from the gift pack. Dark brown pour with small head. Fruity and yeasty aroma.  Nice mix of roasted, spicy and fruity flavour and smooth all around.  Best one in the pack.
"
1," DEC 15, 2006 Aroma"
1," plumb and raisin, brown sugar, fig, date, red apple, pear, bready malt.  Had a hard time taking notes on the aroma instead of diving in and taking a drink.  Overjoyed to find that the taste matches the nose.  Red apples, raisins, pears come out at first.  As you drink, the flavors become darker and more complex.  An earthy presence evolves coinciding with the ever present malty backbone.  The finish is slightly dry with plumb, brown sugar, tart green apple, a touch of spice, floral notes (rose), and a well-integrated splash of booze.  Full bodied with a frothy mouthfeel and a low level of carbonation.  Phenomenally well balanced; showcases the abv while integrating it into the flavor.  I absolutely love this brew.
"
1," Slightly hazy pale golden pour with a clean white finger thick head that dissipates quickly.  Very malty aroma with a hint of alcohol on the nose as well along with cider.  Malty bread flavor but not much else.
"
1," 20 oz Bottle-Total Wine and Spirits Cherry Hill NJ. Dark brown pour with a slight head into a Trappist glass. Solid fruity aroma which is not overpowering. Flavoring is sweet and malty, finishes very enjoyably and truly and excellent beer. Stronger than the white, with an enjoyable higher alcohol content.
"
1," Interesting brown ale.  Sweet malty aroma.  Good malty backbone, end with a good hop bite and a pleasing sweetness.  Nice.
"
1," Bottle, pours a dark brown, smell is with dark fruits and yeast, a bit harsh in the taste, overall it is pretty heavy, not bad
"
1,"  Courtesy of MI2CA via trade.  Moderate aroma of bourbon, chocolate, and vanilla.  Pours a dark brown with some transparency.  Huge off-white head with phenominal retention makes it almost impossible to pour.  Flavor is loaded with bourbon, so much so that other flavors struggle to get thru. Light chocolate and vanilla sneak thru up front with light roasted coffee in the finish and some light acidity.  Fizzy mouthfeel.
"
1," on tap-pours a dissipating off white head and copper color.  Aroma is mild grain, some herbal hops.  Taste is grain/medium malt-caramel, secondary spice hops.  Borders on a Vienna Lager with some Tettnang/Hallertau.  OK now I had the Vienna Lager which has a bit more malt and a bit less hops.
"
1," Nothing special - just a hint of Caramel malt to add some flavor, and a hint of hops as well.  Nice flavor and color.
"
1," JUN 30, 2006 I cant even try to describe the flavor.....complex is the best word. Its like there are so many good flavors you cant pick out one. I LOVE this stuff. pricey though. I had the small bottle. Ill still buy it again.
"
1," Kept this 22oz bottle in my closet for the past few months, hardly cellar conditions, but out of the sunlight. Starts off with a nice thick, almost white head. The beer appears almost black in a low-lit room, but held to the light it demonstrates a ruby red colour. The head settles down to a thin, but steady, layer and leaves nice lacing. The aroma is malty and mellow, but with a slightly sharp hint. Hits the lips like velvet. Smooth texture with a malty, only slightly bitter taste that ends with a hit of alcohol. I expected that this would go a bit skunky in the closet, considering the conditions, but it turned out to be a great, late night bev. Il have to try a brand new bottle for comparison.
"
1," Cask at Blackfriars. A slightly hazy amber beer with a thin lazing beige head. The aroma is sweet malty with primary notes of caramel. The flavor is sweet malty with notes of caramel and bread, leading to a slightly bitter finish.
"
1," 33CL bottle, strong beer. Great head. Nice deep red color. Another good Chimay beer. Dark fruity taste.
"
1," Drank it at Sunnys, Bangalore.  Pours a hazy orange.  Flavor is malty and fruity.  Awesome  finish - a hoppy bite that gives this beer great character
"
1," Draft at Heorot in Muncie, IN. Black color with an average frothy brown head that was mostly lasting with good lacing. Solid roasted coffee malt aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture. Medium roasted balanced flavor with a medium bittersweet finish of moderate duration. This is a solid beer.
"
1," Esta es la pura belga. Esta muy buena, entera y redonda con buen sabor y final. Digna representante de esta categoria. Rica
"
1, bottle		Reviewed on
1," After hearing all of the lore and hype concerning Chimay, I tried this one. Yes, it is a very good beer, with good color, flavor, and nose, but it wasn't the best trappist ale I've had (the flavor wasn't ""rich"" enough for me, and a tad too floral).
"
1," @Richmond/Williamsburg Gathering-22 oz bottle that I brought-pours a foamy tan head and brown color.  Aroma is oak, medium malt.  Taste is oak/walnut, medium malt-chocolate.  Semi-dry.
"
1," 750 ml bottle.  Pours a dark amber with a 1 cm tan head that is mostly lasting.  Aroma of cherry and raisin predominate with some sweet malt hanging around.  Initial flavor is some dull fruitiness that becomes dry and yeasty on the back end.  The alcohol comes through as it warms, but never terribly noticeable.  Medium to full mouthfeel, moderate carbonation, warm and clean finish.  Drinkable in the sense that you could have a Belgian night and work it in, but too distinctive to mix with other styles.
"
1," From a 12 oz. bottle with no freshness date, but from the case box that it came in, I learn this is the bottled version of the new April 2007 recipe, sampled at cellar temperature in a pint glass, first without, then with the recommended slice of orange.		Poured a cloudy pale orangey, yellowish golden with a large frothy, foamy white head that slowly dissipates into a thin sudsy lacing, minimal amount of laced sticking. When I added the half slice of orange, this witbier acquires an even more orangey character.		Without the orange slice, had fruity, wheat malty aroma, lightly spicy, clove and coriander, slight herbal, with orange slice, wheat bready, orange fruity, spicy with a more pronounced clove, a light coriander, and the herbs are cut a bit.		Good, steady carbonation and a crisp, dry, silky smooth medium-light bodied mouthfeel.		Without the orange slice, tart yeastiness, fruity wheat malts, lightly clove and coriander spiciness, a touch of hop spiciness, with orange slice, the yeast loses a little tartness while becoming earthy, the wheat malts dry out, become biscuity, the clove and coriander are more of a feature in the taste, a peppery spiciness, and dry, yeasty, bicuity, spicy finish. I prefer this with the half slice of orange, becomes a truer witbier when added, improves the taste.		Last spring when I took a vacation to Belgium and the Netherlands, I had plenty of witbiers served to me with slice(s) of orange, plus at some of the better brewpubs Ive been to, this practice was done there too, so I dont feel it is a ""crime"" or ""beer geek sin"" to add a little orange to your witbier, especially when that is the brewers design and intent.
"
1," Thick chestnut brown pour.  Aroma of mild coffee with cinnamon, cream and sugar drowning its character.  Non-dememo  flavor of wheat bread and rum with an earthy foundation.  Very tame.  Mildly bittered, more in a nutty sense.  Some vinous qualities of interest.  Palate is diluted.  Lacks personality.
"
1," Draft, pours hazy amber with off white head. Nose has fruity notes, melon and juicy fruit. Flavors balance sweet caramel malts with juicy fruit and orange. Touch sweeter than I want in an ipa but drinkable.
"
1," Poured dark in color with an off white head. Bought a three pack of 1pt. 9oz. bottles , two blue and one red. Had the first blue with dinner grilling steaks and thought this was a decent beer.. So this would be a second time arround for this beer and is alright. Aroma you can notice the fermantation of the malt and the flavor has a decent aftertaste on the palate.
"
1," Bottle 33cl. @ home.Unclear medium yellow orange color with a large, frothy - creamy, good lacing, mostly lasting, white head. Aroma is light to moderate malty, wheat, moderate yeasty, old fruity, light notes of banana and citrus. Flavor is moderate sweet with a average duration. Body is light to medium, texture is watery, carbonation is soft. [20081117]
"
1," Bottle 330ml. clear glass.Clear light neon green yellow color with a small, frothy to fizzy, fair lacing, mostly lasting, light green head. Aroma is moderate to light heavy lemon, lime, soap, artificial, lemon peel. Flavor is moderate sweet and light acidic with a average duration, lemon, green lemon. Body is light to medium, texture is watery, carbonation is soft. [20110130]
"
1,"  Pours a murky caramel color with a modest, creamy beige head.  Smells strong of floral hops, but also wheaty.  Maybe even a bit soapy?  Taste is rather dry and abrasive.  Florals, again soapy, and some wheat.  Hot and brash.  Plain and simple, I just didnt like it.
"
1," Bottle. Vintage. Courtesy Torben Mathews. Creamy lightbrown good mostly lasting head. Dark red amber colour. Moderate malty  light hoppy aroma. Some roast and smoke. Light bitter strange flavor. Average finish. Watery palate.
"
1," 330 ML bottle in Germany. Dark ruby color, great head that is brown in color, nice lace, burnt chocolate aroma, however weak, taste is sweeter than expected, surupy, not the overwhelmingly alcohol taste I expected. Palate is smooth and slighly  very nice, very nice indeed.
"
1," Dark ruby-brown color.  Huge off-white head typifies the style.  Typical Belgian dark aroma is somewhat vinous and spicy.  This Belgian is not overly sweet or complex.  Its alright, Im just not as smitten with it as I was before I started exploring the world of Belgian ales.  Its still a good solid beer, but its still on the bottom rung compared to the other trappist ales Ive had the pleasure of tasting.
"
1," On tap at Big River  Chattanooga.  Poured clear coppery caramel with a light cap of beige head.  The aroma picked up sweet caramel with a touch of molasses.. sweet overall and simple.. but decent.  The flavor found very sweet toasty caramel at the core with a touch of smoke.. the back-end had thicker caramel and a little darker fruit.. also decent.  A touch lighter than medium-bodied on the palate with high carbonation.. a little odd sourness rounded out the finish.
"
1," Pours dark copper/amber color. Very smooth. Aromas of spice and fruits. Sweet start but also has a very slight bitter finish. From a tasting set.
"
1," Abbey Dubbel"" tasting. pours copper-reddish off white head. nose alcohol, grainy, hummos?, hints of dark fruits. flavor grainy, very dry, bland. tasted like an old bottle. another big surprise this rated so poorly.
"
1," Light golden color that looks clean. The taste is right in there with most commercial lite beers. It was a little sweet and reminded me of a mgd that i poured in a glass and left in the frige overnight and then drank it. I drank one to rate it and will not drink another. I guess every micro has to make something for everybody. Not as bad as a Natural lite but just not for me.
"
1," Bottle,  Heavy hoppy aroma and taste.  Grapefruit and orange peel flavors shine through.  Decent frothy off white head with decent lacing.  Huge floaties with a medium amber color. Hoppy bitter initial flavor that carries over to the end.  Medium bodied with a rather dry texture.  Medium carbonation.  An average IPA.
"
1," One of the best Belgians.  I love it lots.  Fruit flavors with nice alcohol hints.  A great fall and spring drink.
"
1," One of the best beers to cross these lips, this is an excellent standard.  Slightly fruity aroma and taste, with an extremely smooth palette.  Well balanced.
"
1," JAN 3, 2011 Hazy orange coloured beer with small white head, floks of yeast visible and only few carbonation visible. Yeasty hoppy aroma. Full sparkling palate. Finish is bitter dry with a fruity touch. (@WE)
"
1," Chimay Red is my favorite of the three, but they are all good.  My opinion of Chimay has come down a little since I tried Westy and Rochefort, but this is still great stuff.
"
1," Hefig-herber Geruch. Hefeantrunk, anschlieend herber und wrziger. Fruchtige Tne werden nicht angeschlagen. Im Endspurt malzig und erneut herb. 	Trinkbar, aber nichts berragendes.
"
1," FEB 28, 2007 750mL bottle sampled out of a Trappist glass.  Great beer!  Amber/copper colored head.  Smells of fruit, malt, and some yeast.  The taste is dominated mostly by sweet fruit, which may be perceived by some to be too sweet for their taste.  Moderately sweet finish that lingers on my tongue.  I think this is a great beer, but I feel its a little too sweet for me (possibly because of the added sugar).  If youre going to sample a Chimay beer, Id recommend a Blue or White label over this...
"
1," Wonderful beer.  Definately deserves the things I've heard about it.  A nice complex spice taste.  Way more layers then I was able to pick out.  A must have.
"
1," Another great Trappist ale although I think this one is a little bit overrated.
"
1," Sweet complexity incarnate.  I considering a move to Belgium.
"
1," Hazy golden appearance. Very refreshing and a subtle hop character. Well balanced and original. A good Zwickel.
"
1," Copper coloured beer with a creamy beige head, long lasting and with good lacing. Aroma includes fruity and floral characters with some caramel malts. Quite obvious alcohol content. A lot of complex fruity flavours aswell as sweet darkish malts and hops. Has a dryish, bitter flowery finish. An authentic trappist beer.
"
1," Saved this one for Thansgiving.  Clean, flowery aromna upon opening, nice dark, tobacco-like appearance with a long lasting cream colored but little lacing head.  Alcohol is hidden well - but warms the tummy. Best of the three easily accesible Chimays.  Flavor - detect a bit of raisins that intensifies as it warms up.  Very enjoyable.
"
1," Out of the bottle, amber with a good head. Aroma was nice but the flavor was rather bland. Il try it again and rerate.
"
1," MAR 14, 2003 Creamy foamy long lasting head	Thick, dark. pretty roasted malt, and a hint of chocolate.		Gotta love it		Tastes great at almost room temperature.
"
1," Poured in a Trappist glass.  Very cloudy copper color with a medium off-white head.  Light yet complex aroma of apricot, banana, and maybe some dark fruit, as well as some caramel malt and some spice.  Flavor is caramelly, fruity, and just a little salty.  Fairly fizzy mouthfeel and a long finish of malty caramel and some bitterness.  I like this about as much as the other Chimays, just in a different way.
"
1," It was poured into the Chimay tulip glass. The pour was dark brown and was very carbonated as it took a long time to settle. The taste was a little brown sugar and mild raisin. It was an overall easy drink for a 9% beer.  Well worth a try.
"
1," Pours light mahogany with frothy white head.  Aroma of caramel, yeast, slight spiciness and dried fruit.  Well-rounded but subdued flavor of caramel malt, yeast, and light fruit.  Slightly dry palate.  A little underwhelming.
"
1," Strong bouqet of grain, honey, and skunk. Cloudy amber color, thin head, nice. Dry barley taste, weak but noticeable hops. Subtle sweet corn finish. If only macros could meet this standard, Id have a lot more disposable income.
"
1," From a bottle poured a dark amber color with a good amount of head.  Light sweet malty flavor with a quick finish.
"
1," Bouteille de 720 ml - Dgust avec french tickler - Biere de couleur brune brumeuse avec un mince collet non collant. Odeur de sucre brun , banane murie, alcohol, pommes. Gout de sel, agrable et douce en bouche avec un peu de carbonisation.
"
1," The beer in the glass is golden yellow with a little CO2, and a medium-pored head. Hoppy-bitter flavor. The beer starts very hoppy, with a clearly perceptible tartness. However, did not seem to be exaggerated. The aftertaste also resonates for a long time, bitter hoppy, with minimal grain clay. The further course is good hoppy-bitter, the grainy aroma goes back almost completely.
"
1," I finally got to try the elusive Chimay Blanche.  It was almost sour and had heavy bread and alcohol flavors.
"
1," Light orangy yellow.  Mixed malt and hop aroma, subdued.  Thin, upfront malts and some hops that struck me as earthy and slightly floral.  IMO, they have better beers than this one.
"
1," Bottle.  Pours an opaque brownish-tawny color w/ a nice off-white head that sticks around.  Aroma is not overpowering on pour.  Autumn spices and fruitiness hit the back of the tongue causing it to tingle as it goes down.  Medium bodied.  A pretty nice brew.
"
1," 330 ml bottle. Rated @ 21.3.2009.	Pours a hazy reddish brown colour. Light fruitiness on the nose and notes caramel malts. The flavour is very barley-driven with malts, spices, banana and yeast. Medium bodied with a dry and fruity finish. Classic dubbel.
"
1," Another brew I was let down by.  This is my 200th rating, though, so I figured one of my more expensive brews would be a good one to rate.  I drank this whole bottle by myself, so it is very drinkable.  You dont taste the alcohol, but you will feel it.  It looks perfect with a creamy head.  The aroma is good, but not strong enough to justify higher than a seven.  Really, this brew was complex, but I was unimpressed.  It had a nuttiness to it, with some caramel tones, but overall, this is definitely not as good as other Belgian ales likes Duvel.
"
1," Just a great beer.  Looks beautiful, rich and full, dark but a hint of orange.  Citrus notes, but not fruity.  Creamy thick head gives way to a smooth but strong beer that lasts forever on the palate and could change your worldview if left to do so.  Try it.
"
1," Pitch dark brown with a white head. Malty and yeasty aroma with caramel, dark fruits and woody tones. Full and very smooth palate. Flavour is great, complex, with berries, plum, spices and chocolate.
"
1," Nothing special.
"
1," Rich dark appearance with a huge frothy chocolaty head. Mild aroma of sweet malts and lightly hoppy. Flavor is quite sweet, rather chocolaty with strong carmel tones, very thick, somewhat chalky, and a little bit sour, that detracts from it. Decent but far from great.
"
1," From the hand pump. Hazed brown pour with creamy tan head and lace. Light sour malt aroma. Light caramel malt with a sour that is just a hint off. Thin and watery.
"
1," Just a superb Trappist rendition.  I love the yeasty fullish bodied content, the red-copper color, the Belgian lace and overtones of malted caramel among other enticing flavors.  The best of the Chimay line.
"
1," Enjoyed this beer, but again, is not the perfect beer that others claim.  Good mouthfeel, with a hoppiness that complements the maltiness nicely.  Wont drink regularly due to cost, however.
"
1," Bottle. Pours deep brown with effervescing bubbles and a thick foamy beige head. Malty grain aroma along with some lightly floral and fruity hop accents. Flavor is plums, slightly nutty, with some toffee and a nice bitterness. Distinct yeast flavor gives it an underlying basement mustiness. Mouthfeel is moderately full.
"
1," Brown with big beige head.	Very malty and yeasty aroma.	Pretty spicy, and lots of malt.	Rather strong alcoholic taste, rally not integrated.	No pronounced hop, but sweetness is there.	Good beer. Not my favourite since I like a little more hops.
"
1," Deep ebony with a maple border. Fizzling foam subsides to a dark tan  edge. Mellow aroma of vanilla, tar, cola, back licorice, and sharp bourbon. Moderate roastiness and moist soil notes. Fuzzy carbonation. Tannins add some firmness to the slick body. Soft cottony roastiness embraces the  delicate bourbon flavors. Brief earthy hop appearance at the heart of the brew. Rich toasted wood undertones couple with charred malts, adding even more firmness to the flavor. Bourbon is remarkably clean and perfumey, yet sweet enough to withstand the harsh malts and brighten the aforementioned subtleties of the whiskey. Gentle notes of vanilla and caramel cushion the vague acidity. Toasted wood and chalky black malts deepen the bourbon flavors in the finish with their resilient dryness. Delicate remnants of vanilla and black malt hulls on the tongue. This could benefit from a heartier aroma and more body/creamier carbonation. Otherwise, this is very well balanced and packs a delicious bourbon flavor.
"
1," Aroma was roasty, malrty and sweet. Pours dark black with some head and a medium mouth feel. Flavor is a bit of bisquit chocalate, carmel, brown sugar! and some molasses.. Very well Done
"
1," Pours a murky reddish/brown color with an off-white head.  Smells of malt and spices with a light hops and fruit aroma.  Is extremely effervescent.  Tastes somewhat caramely with a strong malt flavor and a bitter aftertaste.  The best of the Chimay beers.
"
1," Pours a nice deep amber/bronze, smells of dark fruits with a hint of caramel...tastes strongly of dried fruits, toffee, with a slight alcohol bite.  Does a very good job concealing the 9%abv, excellent beer.
"
1," Bottle from MiP, thanks! Brown color, cloudy. Yeasty aroma. Banana, yeast and bubblegum in the flavor. Im not impressed, couldnt get past the yeast. The balance was lacking a bit, and the beer is fairly alcoholic.
"
1," Copper/Red color. Substantial head. Fruity and medium bodied and flavored. Slight bitter finish.
"
1," Dark nut brown with thick tan head.  Yeasty/spicy aroma.  Full bodied, sweet, port notes with malty finish
"
1," On tap at Seven Bridges. Yep, its a light lager, Bud Light clone. Meh. I got nothin fer this one.
"
1," Pours a darker ruddy brown with cream tan head.  Smells slightly yeasty but with molasses and some honey.  The taste is really sweet and easy to drink.  It is not cloyingly sweet, but to the point it is quite enjoyable.  Thicker mouthfeel and not so fizzy I was confused like I had been with the white.  I kinda wish it had a little roasty note or some coffee to bring it closer to a stout because this tastes damn good and I want it to fit in my category of favorites.  Very much enjoyed and will have the Blue again.
"
1," Bottle from set available at the wooden keg.  This is probably my favorite of the blue, red and white.  So smooth and buttery.  pours dark brown maybe a hint of red with lots of thin bubbles.  Taste is bitter and overly bubly at start but as the beer warms the palate becomes smooth and the flavor really comes out.
"
1," massive head following pour...dark brown app....palate was a little harsh; a strong smoked smell for aroma....bourbon flavors, with some notes of cream, chocolate, and coffee	a decent oatmeal stout, but nothing special
"
1," Maple, low roast on nose.  Opaque black body with creamy taupe head.  Smoke and roasted barley quickly present on the forepalate.  Suprising amount of bitterness finishes.  Medium bodied yet heavy drinking.  A stout for sure but overpowering roastiness.
"
1," 1st of many trappist beers I will try. although the bottle says Ale it is nothing like any ale I have ever tried. The weirdest taste was almost a carbonation feeling. Looking forward to trying the red and white from Chimay.
"
1," my heart, body, and soul are truly rich.			Bourbon barrel-aged beers, how I love thee And though some may disagree, tasting the bourbon is most certainly not a detriment. The Beastie Barrel Porter from Barley Island Brewing was right up my alley-o-bliss from which I feel no desire to return any time soon. If you can find a bottle or two or three, be greedy and bring them all home with you. Trust.
"
1," Pours a brown/dark amber color with a white head.  Has a sweet malty aroma.  Nice sweet taste, a little banana and a little spice, good malt character.  Very good overall.
"
1," My favorite of the Chimay beers. lovely aroma, appearance and great taste that lingers very well
"
1," Golden, slight haze; scant aroma - maybe some hop.  Mostly cold-tasting, they really need to serve this warmer, because all I got were some husky malt flavours and vague herbal hoppiness.  The brewer told me he brought in special pale malts from a small German producer and they were wonderful malts, etc...they were completely lost on me, and I know Gary can brew so its not for lack of talent.  But if theyre lost on me, theyll be lost on just about everyone else, too, which is a shame because I dont want discourage brewers from seeking out the best ingredients possible.
"
1," Nashville.  The sout that bit back.  It looks good, and smells good too, but its almost too much of a good thing.
"
1," A pleasant beer, with caramel flavor, nice color and good maltiness. Too much carbonation, though. I would like the opportunity to try this one on tap some time.
"
1," JUN 3, 2006 12oz bottle-A nice malty coffee smell with a huge head and not sure if it was overcarbonated or infected. very faint dark roasted flavor on the front end but became more abundant on the back end.	Not good or bad.
"
1," On tap at GTMW.  Poured deep brown with almost no head.  The aroma picked up sweet, toasted black patent malts with tangy oak, vanilla, and a touch of bourbon surrounding and riding out the back.. a little coconut there too.. decent components, but it didnt come together that well.  The flavor found a lot more bourbon than the nose suggested, with vanilla and milkier chocolates beneath.. too much barrel.  Medium-bodied at most with lots of tangy barrel on the palate.. too sharp to be pleasant.
"
1," AUG 28, 2008 Deep ruby brown color. Head is beige and creamy. Very fruity aroma is sweet, raisiny, malty and yeasty. Flavor is fruity, sugary malty, yeasty and raisiny. Quite full-bodied, smoothly and foamy carbonated and alcoholic palate.
"
1," Has a very thick foam when poured.  The color is rich amber.  The aroma is sweet and mellow.  It has a roasty caramel flavor.
"
1," Draught at the brewpub. Weak yeasty aroma. Very cloudy yellow colour. Stable white head. The flavour starts off quite weak and watery, but turns fruity with a yeasty and slightly spicy aftertaste. Cleansing and slightly rough bitter finish.
"
1," Pours a deep amber. Bready malty nose. Smells musty and slightly fruity. Medium to full body.
"
1," Draft a Seven Bridges. Poured a auburn color with a moderate frothy white head that diminished quickly. Average sweet malty aroma. Light to medium body with a thin texture. Same sweet malty flavor with little bitter finish of short duration. Many better brews from this location.
"
1," Pourred a very dark brew with a huge withe fluffy head and small bubble coming on top. This one has less of the sweeter taste then the red and more roastiness. This beer also has a firm body and the alcohol taste is not too distinct. The spice are very complex. This one is also a classic and never can get enough of.
"
1," Pours a hazy orange with a nice white head. Aroma is dry, fruit, sour, yeast. Flavor is yeast, dry, fruit, pepper with floral notes. My least favorite of the chimay line, but still pretty decent.
"
1," Tap at BI, really love the idea, but the beer, eh, not so much.  Oak and vanilla nose, light alcohol and, unfortunately, green apple.  Leggy beige head, murky brown body.  Watery, with light bourbon and pale/amber, resolves to a bland bitterish/pale ale taste, forgettable and really without the best elements of the style, which no amount of aging in a Jack Daniels whiskey barrel will change.  In defense of the brewer, this may be an older sample; at the same time, if its being served on location, then there are quality control problems to be addressed (and possibly tap lines to be cleaned).
"
1," Smaller bottle.  Pours a hazy orange gold color with a smaller but lasting white head.  The aroma is hoppy, yeast, and some fruit.  The flavor is fruity, slightly spicy, yeast, sweet honey malts, with a slightly surprising bitterness.  The alcohol is a bit warming.  Decent, but not my favorite.
"
1," (RBESG 2007, Cask at Blackfriars, Glasgow) Amber color, creamy offwhite head. Quite mild malty aroma, fruity and maybe with some yeast. Mild, somewhat fruity flavor and a bit hoppy. Hoppy grassy finish.
"
1," Around $9 / 25.4 oz champaign bottle - I trying to show some love for the Belgians and intentionally trying more from this style.  Yeah, it is pretty good!  I not going to rate it over the top, but has some nice features and a clean finish.  I would not re-buy at the same price, but a solid offering.
"
1," 33 cl bottle, 2004.  Dark, murky and beautiful.  Great head and better lacing.  Aroma full of dark fruit and spices.  Flavor a bit of the same, with some maltiness and a lot of alcohol.  In fact, the alcohol knocks it out of balance.  I prefer the red, but this one is good, too.
"
1," bottle from strykzone.  Dark brown pour.  small tan head. Aroma is very nice with fruit, caramel, syrup,and maybe a hit of spice too. Flavor is very nice.  Dark dried fruits, caramel, chocolate, spice and some banana are present.  I am very surprised at some of the low ratings for this beer.  I enjoyed it very much.
"
1," Sampled at the brewpub at Walt Disney World's Boardwalk.  Moderate Cascade hop & malt aroma.  Dark red in color, good head retention.  Roasted malt flavor that is long lasting.
"
1," 11 ounce bottle-a dirty murky brown pour-tan head that stays-aroma and taste of sweet sugar,some spice,roasty, caramel, -sweet smooth finish
"
1," This ones a bit hard as I expected a lot from it. Initially poured too cold, sweet and malty nose. Champagne head and mouthfeel. Sugary cola flavor. Surprisingly it got worse when it got warmer. It went stale very quickly, loosing all carb and flavor was like thin coffee. Quite thin and light overall, which was a surprise. I pretty sure Il try this again.
"
1," 750 ml bottle.  Pours hazy brown with a thick, long lasting tanned head. Aroma is of dark fruit, yeast and brown sugar.  The body is full and smooth.  Taste is dark fruit, brown sugar and Belgium yeast. Long lasting, dry finish.  I used to like this brew much more.  Must be my taste has changed over the years.
"
1," Dark beer that pours a small head but leaves quite a bit of lace. There is a reason they call this Sweet Magnolia, Wow was it sweet. Too sweet, I felt that it needed a bit of a kick (although the alcohol content was not low). It was a decent beer but I got half way through the beer and thought I was drinking a soft drink. Well not really but I think you get the point.
"
1," JUL 14, 2008 A straightforward, classic dubbel.  Pours a hazy copper with a rocky white head.  Lots of malt and fruit up front with a pleasant yeasty follow through.  Fine beer.
"
1," Pours very dark, bit reddish with a god sized brown head.  The aroma has roasty / toasty malt with some chocolate, cream, vanilla and a hint of bourbon.  Medium smooth body with semi-soft carbonation.  The flavor starts much like the aroma with a good amount of balance and some richness.  The finish is quite creamy.  The was significantly better than I expected it to be.
"
1," Tap a decibel in nyc.  Clear in color, what else would it be?  Earthy stone fruit, alcohol.  Pear, apple, earth, and alcohol on the flavor.   A little boozy with medium body.  A good sake I think.
"
1," Bottle. Copper brown with a tan head. Malty caramel aroma with hints of nuts. Good caramel and nutty flavours, semi-dry finish. Decent.
"
1," Just about the thickest head Ive ever seen, pours dark brown, tastes like a caramel apple...holy crap, this is a great beer!
"
1," SEP 3, 2011 Orange brown color, small frothy head. Caramel aroma cabbage and barnyard smell. Sweet flavor with caramel, chichorei and a velvety edge. A bit skunky aftertaste. Not entirely succeeded dunkel. (2.2)		Re-rate august 2011. Tap @ Hotel zum Lwen Schwabthal. Carame;aroma. Maltflavor. Sweetish with milk chocolate, toffee. Sticky mouthfeel. A bit too sweet.
"
1," Bottle.  Pours a cloudy brown with massive head.  Aromas are fruity, yeasty and sweet.  Flavor is pretty darn nice, but mouthfeel is thinner than I expected.  ABV makes itself known with a little bit of a warmth that seeps through the thick fruit and candi sugar sweetness that dominates the palate until the yeast flavors can take you down the home stretch.
"
1," The aroma is a bit off but has all the basic elements of a porter, toasted malt, coffee, and chocolate (all be it very weak). The appearance is brown with a small head. The flavor is like the aroma but not yummy. The palate is thin. Overall not one of my favorites.
"
1," Dark red/brown with a fruity / yeast aroma.  Farily fruity flavour and some spices.  Sweet to the tongue and ends with a very bitter finish.
"
1," Vary hazy, reddish-copper color with a fizzed up head, much of which remained for the duration of my drink.  Spiced-up, fruity aroma.  Sour alcohol flavor... thats what I tasted right off.  Some dark, dried fruitness to it.  A touch of bitterness.  Ill have it again, but not often.
"
1," (650ml bottle) Purchased at the Sailor Hagars Off-Sale for ~$5. Quite a compliment when your former employer keeps a beer named after you - Gary Lohin must be honoured... and its a solid beer based on his recipe. Lasting almond-coloured, foam head with a deep copper body. Nose is strong and balanced of malt and hops. A robust fruitiness and well malted flavour - though its so hoppy that it would be a logical replacement for a thirsty hophead!
"
1," Medium brown pour with a huge tan head. Very effervescent and the head stays put for quite a while. The aroma is more subtle that Id expect, but there is a nice combo of sweet fruits, candied fruit, malts, and just a little hop bitterness. Flavor is nearly fine wine like in its smoothness. Nothing jumps out, just a fine mingling of sweet and dry. One of the best.
"
1," bottle, bought at the brewerys Getrnkemarkt in Ergenzingen. Cloudy pale yellow colour, large white head. Fruiyt and malty, pleasantly wheaty with a yeasty character.
"
1," This IPA was OK, it was not make the brewer on staff now.  The new IPA is much better, its won medals.  The old brewer is in Durango the owner said, so avoid those brews!!
"
1," Crushed at the Crescent Moon. Not bad. More like a premium lager than a pale. Very smooth and light. Lots of bready malt with a kiss of hops. Like the dude before me said, its a nice session beer.
"
1," Nice taste of yeast with some sweet flowery flavors. Great palate with light hoppy and roasted malt aftertaste. Very pleasant beer to enjoy in good company.
"
1," Dark brown,fast fading tan head.Light chocolate mint nose. Thin watery malt profile. Minty, with a faint hop finish
"
1," Bottled.  Hazy copper/amber, rich head. Sourish fruity nose. Slender with peppery alcohol and white wine. Very slight caramelly malt. Tart finish, more or less without bitterness.
"
1," Deep amber pour with fluffy tan head and lace. Aroma of light caramel malt. Light caramel malt flavor, brown sugar, and a light finishing bitter. Medium bodied with good carbonation with just a light hint of watery. Very nice with just a hint of spiceyness.
"
1," eh...wheatbeer is not my thing. the spice adds a different dimension, but if i going to have a wheatbeer, il stick with gumballhead.

"
1," FEB 23, 2009 Pours a frothy tan head which diminishes but has good lacing. The reddish brown body held tiny particles which swirled and begged me to drink them. The smell was a tantalizing array of fruits, but the burnt caramel and toffee were the leading scents, some rising yeast as well. Burnt toffee was again apparent in the taste, as well as roasted malt and fermenting fruit on the sides of the tounge. It doesnt mask the alcohol well, its true, but still a delicious creation! Light and oily on the palate, soft carbonation, slight alcoholic aftertaste. This is a classic.
"
1," On tap at Disneys Boardwalk. Pours dark red with a thick off white head. Hop grapefruit, pine, and malt aroma. Nice balance of the malt and hops in the taste. Finishes with a nice hop bitterness.

1," This is my favorate beer so far.  It takes a lot to beat Guinness for me.  The red label is mor readily available in this area but the Grande Reserve is by far the best of the Belgiums.
"
1," Bottle from hopdog via Mystery Swap 2.0.  Pours deep blackish with 1-finger tan head.  Aroma of big coffee grounds, roast dark malt, some hops and jalapeno oil.  Very coffeeish aroma.  The taste is roasty malty, with a rich flavor of coffee and jalapeno oils...similar to Bells Java stout but perhaps not as smooth.  It gets a bit tarter as it warms.  Very unique.
"
1," sampled from 750, courtesy of Barry. Pours a light brown with a long lasting white head.  Aroma is of slighty dark fruit, banana clove, spice.  Taste is of dark fruit, bready, banana, some spicy hops, body not very robust but I still enjoyed this.
"
1," Pale greenish golden, a bit unclear, medium sized to big stable off-white head; moderate sweetish grainy-malty nose with ""woody"" hops underneath; light to moderate sweet-bitter flavour, light bodied and soft; increasing bitterness in the malty and ""woody"" finish. Not earth-shaking, but well made.......
"
1," Pale golden, quite stable white fluffy head, bisquity, clean pale-malty nose with a good shovel of aromatic ""oaky"" hops; moderate bitter-sweet flavour, light bodied, low carbonation; aromatic tettnang hops in the slightly lingering bitter-sweet finish. A fine, spicy brew.......
"
1," Dark, dark brown, big light but sturdy head. Aroma is certainly woody. Mildly roasty flavor, woody finish, and not a very good wood taste either, tastes like I licked a 2x4.

"
1," I ended up drinking several of these at Disney World because it was about the best beer I could find.  A nice hoppy amber ale.  Good malty taste with a nice citrusy hope presence as well.
"
1," I have officially become a beer geek - I have purchased a corked Trappist Ale and a six of Milwaukees Best for $2.99 in the same week.  Very enjoyable, from the frothy, creamy white headed pour which leads to a dark amber appearance. Malty, fruity flavor that lasts throughout the 1.9 pint bottle.  Hard to tell that is so high in alcohol content as well as it is hidden well - the alcohol does not overwhelm the flavor - all in all, a great ale.
"
1," bottle.  nice bready aroma.  Maple brown color, very cloudy, decent head with the pour, dissapates fairly quickly. slight kick on the tongue to start, good malty finish. Pretty decent overall.

1," 12 oz bottle from Sahara Mart (Bloomington, IN), 5/15/09	 Part of the totally and completely made up""The Geororodanda Beer Sampling Party""			Aroma"
1," Bam, Monks rule!  Out of the smaller 11.2oz bottle, the delicate aire of plums light yeast and raisin eminates.  A hazy prunish color to with a lively foamy dirty white head.  One sip begged for more, lively, light roast tones of raisin and plum.Palate just said to have some more.  Thank the lord this ones easy to get.
"
1," An absolute pleasure to imbibe.  The spicy-fruity flavor is delicious.  If you only had to drink one beer forever, this could be it.  Very tasty.
"
1," a bit of spicy hops, slightly dry. Decent carbonation. Very dry hoppiness. Not so much on the citrus/pine. A tad watery. Sessionable pale, but lacks complexity.
"
1," Cask-conditioned at the Hillgrove Porter Stores, Bristol 29/01/09. Deep gold with n head. Aroma of heather honey, citrus hops and caramel. Sweetish flavour with some hay and a dry finish. Ok.
"
1," The beer pours medium tea colored brown with lots of carbonation. The very light tan head rises about 4 fingers then falls relativerly quickly. A soapy full head stays for a while. The retention is ok. 		The aroma is pretty strong with lots of balance. There is dark fruit, light alcohol, caramel and lots of yeast.		The taste is a little boring and light. It starts off with some caramel then gets very yeasy.		The feel is really light.		This is one of the worse trappist beers and a terrible dubbel. Westmalle, westy and achel destroy this.
"
1," Courtesy of kmweaver. Dark brown body with a light tan head. Dark chocolate nose with toffee and dark fruits. The flavor is moderately sweet, lightly bitter with milk chocolate, anise, molasses and prunes. Medium body is a bit thin with moderate carbonation.
"
1," When I first pour it, I smell the bready yeast.  Its a hazy copper-gold color with pillow head like merange.  Notes of fruit, and bitter hop and alcohol finish.
"
1," (22oz bottle thanks to RedHaze) Pours clear dark brown with oily bubbles on top. Nose of brown sugar, pine hops. Taste of toasted sugar, pine hops, more bitter than I expected. Nice sweet balance with a creamy finish. Didnt really taste like a quad to me, but still enjoyable.
"
1," (Draught)  Pours a lightly hazy golden body with a slightly off-white head.  Aroma of citrus, clove, yeast, and herbal notes.  Flavor of apricot, herbs, and grass with a moderately bitter finish.
"
1," Pours reddish brown with a lively, bubbly head that sticks around.  Aroma is complex, funky and fruity.  Taste just does not live up to the aroma or the appearance.  The flavors are very subtle, and basically kind of boring.  There is some dark fruit, and some bitterness along with sweet malts... but nothing jumps out and grabs you.  This is my least favorite of the Chimay brews, and I only drink it if its given to me.  In fact, this is the worst trappist beer I have tried.
"
1," Draught @ IBF - Italia Beer Festival Milano 2009, Palalido, Piazza Carlo Stuparich, Milano, Italy.Clear medium yellow color with a average, frothy, good lacing, mostly lasting to diminishing, white head. Aroma is light to moderate malty, toasted, sweet malt, light hoppy, grass. Flavor is moderate sweet and bitter with a average duration. Body is light medium, texture is watery to oily, carbonation is soft. [20100307]
"
1," 	Cask at Blackfriars. Slight grassy hops with some harsh malt and a dusty tobacco finish. Smells and tastes quite a lot like a bitter shandy.
"
1," Pretty good, I didnt expect much out of this.  A barely carbonated, and very smooth stout.  Loads of coffee in the aroma and flavor, some chocolate, and roasted malt.
"
1," Draft at Brewers Rendezvous. Tasting of 7/10/10. Pours a thin off white head, over a clear, light brown (SRM 18) body.....nose is roasted malt with a tiny bit of chocolate/coffee tones.....taste is light roasted malts, finishing neutral....mouth feel is light, carbonation low to medium. This is an almost perfect rendition of a Mild, which is what the brewer was aiming for. BJCP 6/3/12/4/6
"
1," JAN 31, 2008 Murky chesnut specimen in requisite goblet. Dirtily creamy marbled suds. Sourly yeasty nose after the pour, softening into prunes and boozy caramel. Milkily creamy palate without a trace of alcohol. If anything, this beer is just too neutral and smooth, and slips inoffensively down without developing any really distinct flavours. Wheres the finish? Wheres the hops? Its all watery malt and milky caramel. Smells fantastic, but not as tasty or balanced as the last beer I sampled (Bitburger Pils). (Re-rate, 01/02/08) Some hops, earthy yeast and Trappist character, which is surprising. But too much stale cardboard. Gentle liquorice bitterness to finish. Thin and papery/ashy like Leffe. Even smells of cardboard. Different to last time, but still mediocre, even for a bog standard dubbel.
"
1," 33cl stubby bottle, at least a year old.  Pours a hazy amber with a large light foam off-white head that settles to a thin covering.  Aroma is candied and ripe dark fruits, yeast, and some light caramel.  Flavor is lighter than expected, with more ripe and candied fruits, yeast and light caramel.  A milder and accessible entry level belgian beer, but nothing too special or complex.
"
1, Belgian Strong indeed!  The nose is complex
1," JAN 24, 2007 Deep brown with ruby highlights in the pour, with a frothy white head that dissipates quickly and leaves just a clouding on top of the beer - overall really nice looking in a glass suited to its appearance.  Dark stone fruits in both the nose and the taste, with that prototypical Belgian spiciness and sweet malt making appearances.  Only a flash of alcohol that is hidden very well.
"
1," A golden IPA with a thin white head. In aroma, a lightly floral hops with faint malt. In mouth, intense hops, herbal, grapefruit pulp, lightly bilous, medium bodied. On tap at the brewpub, July 30 2011.
"
1," Pours a clear bright gold/amber with an OK white head that laces the glass some.  Sweet malt and hop bouquet.  Taste is sweet pale malt, bisquits and a light hoppiness.  Refreshing and quite good.
"
1," Draught @ Gasthaus Spreewlder, Dorfstrae 53, Schlepzig, Brandenburg, Germany 15910.Hazy matt medium yellow colour with a average, frothy, good lacing, mostly lasting, white head.

1," En bon Belge, rien de tel que de dguster une bonne chimay avec un fromage du terroir. En vente dans toutes sorte de surface, facile daccs.
"
1," [Bottle] Pours a very dark brown color with no meaningful head. Nose is of dark malts, red wine, raisins and residual alcohol. Molasses, coffee beans, vanilla, chocolate and heavy raisin and plum notes in the taste. Reminded me of Port in some ways. Sweet red wine finish. Nicely masked alcohol. Syrupy. Kind of a weird brew actually. I liked it at the end, but it had to grow on me.
"
1," Pour opaque darkest brown with only glimmers of red. Tan, head, good retention but only minimal lace. Aroma of tart cherries with a whiff of chocolate. Flavor built around the tart-sweet roast malt dark fruits, especially at the beginning of the sip, moving on to a chocolate malt finish. The caramel from the barrel is a very subdued secondary characteristic. An added dimension comes in from a generous addition of smoke and ash, pleasantly roasty, not burnt. Full bodied, but refreshing in spite of its weight. Nice beer.
"
1," SEP 18, 2010 Excellent beer.  Light flowery bouquet with hints of malt.  Nice deep brown color with a thin pillowy head.  Very well balanced on the palate, sweet and thin up front, bitterness in the middle and a nice malty, dry finish, that does not outstay its welcome.  A full bodied beer.  I love the tripel with the lighter fare, especially sushi, but this is the go to beer with steaks.
"
1," On tap at the brewery in Nashville. Pours a turbid pils color. Banana/wheat aroma. Taste like an American Hefe - banana/clove/wheat. Light and refreshing, well-crafted.
"
1," JUL 7, 2005  Bottled. 2004.  Dark brown color with a thick head. Yeasty nose, along with vague notes of banana and clove. Light spicy flavour but a bit too alcoholic. Roasted malt is obvious. Needs ageing, yes? 6/3/6/3/13.	 After three years of ageing this has turned wonderful. Still quite thick mouthfeel, with notes of wood and chocolate. And no flavour from the cork. Rich remaining head.
"
1," My first pass at a Belgian Ale.	Doesnt seem to have a dominant	hop or malt flavor.  Very alcoholic though	doesnt taste it.

1," just a strong lager with extreme bittering hops. Interesting though - and very unusual for Germany. 241010

1," Mmm! Chimay-may! This beer is pretty good, but for only 8% I thought that the alcohol taste was too prevalent. I think I prefer the other Chimay beers to this one.

1," NOV 21, 2006 Oh boy. What a complement to blue cheese. A rich caramel aroma with toffee richness in mouthfeel. Great creamy texture with a lively carbonation at first that settles down to imitate a vintage port or tokay. Roll on winter! RE-RATE"
1," Bottle. Cloudy and dark brown with a great off white head. Very sweet but also kinda lemony read fruity - maybe). Pruns and caramel - very good.
"
1," Pours a murky brown with a creamy off-white, two finger head that fades slowly to a thick cap and leaves a thick sheeting of lacing.		Smell; a little bit of some dark fruits, and a touch of chocolate. Its hard to really pick many aromas out, as the smell much more subdued than I would have expected.		Taste; as with the smell, the flavors are not very assertive. Theres a little bit of raisins and some chocolate. Theres aso a bit of apples as well as a slightly woody quality.The mouthfeel is a bit watery and thin, and rather boring for a dubble.		This is a good beer, but for the price, there are many others that I would rather spend the money on.
"
1," From a 12 oz bottle.  Deep brown/red with a bubbly white head.  Fruity and smoky.  Malty in its own right, not so much as the Blue, more of a smoky malt flavor.  Great balance.  One of the better dubbels out there (from the few Ive had so far).
"
1," (Draught)  Pous a clear amber body with a small white head.  Aroma of toasted malt and nuts.  Flavor of caramel and toasted malt.

1," Dark red-brown with a finger of off white head.  Lightly metallic malty aroma, some pit fruits, cherries.  Taste is light, thin malts, nuttiness, more fruits and a light spiciness.
"
1," Pours dark brown, some red. Small, fizzy head. Lots of carbonation. Sweet. Some yeast and candy aroma. A bit like home made Christmas brew in Norway.
"
1," OCT 23, 2005 Re-rating this fellow, (1992, kulminator, dirk didnt look sure about giving this, so thanks). Aroma is a good aged appely/oakiness, that i normally find this aged beer, i think it could have done with another few years however, fruit and light sweetness that i wouldnt normally have expected from  this being as old as it is. Taste is similar to taste with the apples blending well with the darker fruits to create a delicious beer. I actually found the gf, pauline, had left half a glass left on the table towards the end of the nite and was like bonus if ever there was one.
"
1," DEC 28, 2008 une vraie trappiste   belle brune opaque magnifique a la lumiere  Douce mais gouteuse  Est ce la meilleure?   THE BEST FUCKINBELGIAN  BEER
"
1," Hazy orange pour with a white head. Aroma of sweet fruit, especially citrus, and yeast. Light body. Flavor of sweet fruits and pale malts.
"
1," Bottle.  Pours a light orange amber body with a big fluffy head.  The least favorite chimay in my opinion.  Aroma is dry and earthy and has a good pepper yeasty backbone.  Flavor is that. A solid beer thats an easy choice.  I enjoyed it slightly less on draft.
"
1," The body is nicely black with a good lasting head. The aroma and flavor are BIG chocolate supported by charcoal and roasted malt. This isn't harsh, but soft, the bitterness of both the dark malts and the hops are very low. A bit sweet, but not cloying. This is a good easy-drinking stout.
"
1," DEC 30, 2010 bottle, nice dark brown colour with stable and white lacing head. Yeasty and fruity smell. Taste"
1," AUG 12, 2009 My Bottom Line"
1, Pours a dark black body capped by one full of inch of tannish-hued head.		Smell
1," On tap at the brewpub. Clear gold pour with a thin veil of white foam. Aroma of classic tripel alcohol esters, rosemary, fresh bread, grain and belgian yeast. Taste is spicy/yeasty with a rather strong alcohol finish. Palate is very dry, which helps make this beer much more enjoyable.
"
1," Bottle that Ive had many times. Has this recipe changed? Or is it my palate. Waited on this to warm and had a malty yeasty nose. Some lint carbonation.  In this bottle I was surprised by how light it seemed. Flavor opens to some dark fruits and rich malts nicely combined with Belgian yeasts. Finish is smooth with some sweetness.
"
1," nice light hop flavor.  very smooth and relaxing.  a nice beer to have on a humid TN night.
"
1," I had a six pack of this while visiting friends in Noblesville, Indiana. Aroma is citrus, and florals. The flavor is a little different from any other IPA ive had. It starts out floral-like, but only for a split second before it turns into an acidity dryness, and finishes monotonous. It wasnt horrible, but it could use some work. It does accomplish being different. Maybe thats the ""tavern style""
"
1, snifter
1," Bottle.  Medium dark brown opaque pour.    Strong bourbon aroma, with some alcohol and maybe a woody/earthy hint. I felt the standard porter aromas were very obscured by the bourbon and unbalanced.   Medium roasty malt flavors, with bourbon and chocolate.  Way too carbonated.
"
1," Beer poured with that ""Belgian Brown"" color...virtually no light passes through and a foamy tan head sits atop the brew. Aroma of deep fruit leaps out of the glass to tickle my nose. The taste is dark fruits, plums and other things I cant distinguish cuz Im not good at that. The mouthfeel is more carbonated than most Belgians Ive had and the taste is not as sweet. Alcohol flavor comes out as it warms.
"
1," No aroma to speak of. Opaque dingy copper pour. Dirty copper taste, but high quality hops. A bit yeasty. with a metallic finish. Alt platzs other wheat beer, the Hefenweasel is much, much better.
"
1," Called a red ale. Named after Leo, a neighbourhood cat.  Draught.  Pours red with medium fast dissipating head.  Light lacing. Balanced aroma with some breadiness, like rye bread.  All over the mouth flavour. full mouthfeel.  Tastes lower in alcohol than it is.  Hop finish with some tangerine.
"
1," One of my favorite beers. Very strong aroma, and a premium taste of chocolate, and spices.
"
1," Bottle 65 cl. Courtesy of fiulijn. Pours a clear amber with a smallish off-white head. Sweet, spicy gingerbread aroma. Fairly light body, sweet and spicy, lots of cinnamon here, doughy. Hardly any hops. 080411
"
1," Its a good beer but i just didnt like it very much. Mouthfeel isnt how i like it.
"
1," Dark amber, small head.  Sweet malts, alcohol and burned sugar in the nose. Flavors of raisins, caramel, yeast notes and warming alcohol. A nice winter-warmer.
"
1," On draft at Seven Bridges.  Pours an amber color with an off-white head.  Nose is toffee, cherries, slight vanilla, and a hint of spices.  Flavor is similar with hints of yeast and cherries in the finish.  Nice, malty holiday beer.
"
1," While not my favorite Dubbel, this is still a very solid beer.  A wonderful aroma is the highlight of this beer.  (more detail to come!)
"
1," A beer with a high alcohol percentage, but you cant taste it. It has a sweet taste of caramel - and a nice head for an ale. Lovely beer.
"
1," Sampled at the brewpub at Walt Disney World's Boardwalk.  Red-brown in color.  Aroma is strong of coffee and chocolate malt.  Rather watery mouthfeel is disappointing.  Hop flavor is not in balance with the malt.  OK, I guess.
"
1," Yeast, alcohol, coriander, bitter oranges and cherries in the sweet malty aroma. Opaque, burnished copper coloured with thick, off-white, lasting head. Sweet, brown sugar, caramel malt flavour. Light fruity bitterness cuts the sweetness towards the finish. Medium-full body with nice round mouthfeel. Bottle. Thanks OKBeer!
"
1," Draught at the brewpub. Its warm golden with a creamy head. The aroma has notes of newly harvested grain, malt and flower. The flavour has a light sweetness, notes of flower, newly harvested grain and it ends on a dry note. The grain flavour is very pure and nice.
"
1," On tap. A hazy orangish pour with a lite cramy head. A hops aroma but not much of it. A flavor of hops and lite malt. A decent pale ale but nothing to write home about. I would drink it all night if it was the only real beer out there.
"
1," Had a nice head,which lasted a good time.Aroma was of malt and hops.color brown.tasted like milk chocolate and hops.Finished a bit sour and bitter.Good beer,but I think there is better.
"
1," Black pour with an inch-thick tan head. Aroma of chocolate, malt and a subtle hint of vanilla and bourbon. Flavor is rich, toasted malt with more cocoa, vanilla and a hint of sweet bourbon. A very nice balanced mix. Great.
"
1," In the glass it was an unimpressive pale golden color, but the musty rotten or fremented fruit aroma was very unique.  Flavor is surprising original for a lager, full-bodied with hints of the aroma showing through.  Finish was a little bitter, but not unusual for this style.  I enjoyed this botte down to the last drop, and believe this beer officially puts Armenia on the beer map.  Dont expect to be blown away, but truly a nice beer.  Cheers.
"
1," A strong ale that delivers on taste and aroma. A craft beer that lives up to all the hype.
"
1," Me and my ratings ... this was the first Chimay that I tied and the last for me to rate .. unless I get my hands on some of the rarer stuff. What can I say other han I can still remember he first time I tried it. Prior to working for distributor a friend that worked for them brought a 750 to share at dinner at Brazilian restaurant. She watched as I had my first sip, knowing fully well that I would love it. Always think of the yeast first, then the rest follows .. malt and finally hops to finish it. Hope that they can survive the horrors of modern day technology and al he other plagues of mankind so that we can have good beer. I pray for the brothers.
"
1," Pretty malty for an IPA. Lingering bitter taste and dry mouth follow. Maybe a beer trying to hard? Settles oddly in your belly.
"
1," My least favorite of the three Chimays.  However, its stronger flavor but delicate makes this trappist nothing to sneeze at.  I will take it any day.
"
1," Aroma is reminiscent of wine with sweetness. Taste is plenty of spice and alcohol with a little sweetness. Overall a lot like Duvel.
"
1," strong, sweet and alcoholic. There was a slight bitterness in the aftertaste, but it wasnt a particularly large element in the experience of this beer. Superb.
"
1," I love all the Chimay beers.  This one has a great berry taste with a hint of smooth plain chocolate.
"
1," ( 12oz bottle) Pours black, light tan head. Nose is chocolate syrup, crackers. Taste is coffee, oats. Finishes like unsweetened chocolate with a nice thick body.
"
1," Dark brown with a beige head. Not overly carbonated. Roast malts with a bit of dark fruit and caramel. Well balanced. The alcohol content gives a pleasant warmth but is not overbearing.  A very smooth and flavoursome and beer.
"
1," JUL 7, 2006 Deep hazy auburn brown colour with a thick creamy and lasting head. Dusty, fruity aroma, with hints of spice. Flavour is sweet and bitter, but does not linger.  Re-rate"
1," OCT 31, 2005 A fabulous dubbel. Its a big, full-flavoured ale - I could imagine washing down a big juicy steak with this. It poured a ruby-red colour with a deep caramel head. A big fruity nose - blackcurrant and spices, with some underlying yeastiness. Smooth and creamy on the tongue. Bold chocolate characters amid the fruity middle. Sultanas. Wonderfully easy drinking. A fine cold-weather nightcap. 	(Bottle)
"
1," Bottle. Served in Trappist glass. Pours a burgandy colour, with a lasting head. Aroma of fruit with a subtle sweetness on the palate. Alcohol is well hidden, but still a nice kick. One of my personal favourite Strong Ales. Fantastic.
"
1," 330 ml bottle. Nice dark nutty brown colour with light brown head. Unclear and hazy. Aroma has malts, nuts and earth, cookies, some oat too. Dont know why, but aroma is little light, not so overwhelming than expected. Flavour has some alcohol warmth, some malty dark wheat aroma and banana. Sweet mouthfeel. Frankly, I had more expectations for this.
"
1," Incredible.  Great stuff.  Interesting aroma, the palate changes substantially.  Has a fruity aftertaste.  I highly recommend this beer.
"
1," 75 cl bottle. 2009 vintage. Aroma of bubblegum, raisins, yeast, and alcohol. Dark caramel color and quite murky. Flavor is slightly sweet with a substantial alcohol bite. Fairly light and champagne-like on the palate. Finishes dry and somewhat bitter. Improves in the glass as it warms and oxidizes. This is a complex one but not as much so as I remembered and expected. Id like to try it aged a bit longer as the alcohol was too prominent in this bottle. A little disappointing but still quite good.
"
1," Bottle, Rainhall Drinks, Barnoldswick. Great name, but sadly not a great beer and surely not an IPA as the claim states. Poured a murky orange colour with a vanishing head. Grassy, farty, stale malt aroma. Not enticing. Initially thought this might have been off. Flavour is strange; herby, possible gooseberry, sweet malt, with a slightly unpleasant sourness that sullied this for me. Alcohol is pretty well masked, but this largely fails elsewhere. A whole bottle is a chore to get through.
"
1," I would call this a ladies IPA.	 It has an earthy aroma, the sweetness of carmel gives it depth.  Maybe not a ""tredy"" IPA but one that you will enjoy drinking
"
1," 12oz bottle, no date to be found but assured to be fresh by the distributor.  Pours very hazy orange/amber with a large pillowy off-white head that leaves tree rings of lacing and maintains a persistent foamy cap.  Aroma is strong on citrus rind and pine, oranges, pineapple, some grassy and floral notes, a bit of caramel malt.  Good to very good strength.  Flavor is citrus rind, resinous hops, pine, good caramel malt backbone with mild sweetness, finishes with good lingering bitterness.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, oily, medium to high carbonation.  An excellent IPA with all the qualities that I love...hazy, pungent, bitter.  I impressed.
"
1," Wonderful red color and rich sweet malty flavor, but little hop aroma, and a harsh bitter finish left me wanting more.  Nothing special here.
"
1,"	Silky and refined, this Iced Maple Scotch Ale balances crme brle and maple syrup flavors alongside subtle fruitiness and alcohol warmth. 		Further Personal Perceptions"
1," On tap at Big River.  Poured amber with a coppery sheen.. short cap of off-white head.  Nose was malt-centric (caramel and toffee) with less hoppage than expected (in the form of floral and faint citrus).  Earth and caramel base supported a rather weak hop effort (again the floral and citrus).  Medium-bodied and a tad sticky at times.  This was powerfully OK.
"
1," The Dan Journal #434. Tasted 12/14/10. 12oz bottle. Opaque with a dark brown hue. Ring of khaki head. Aromas of raisins and cooked sugar. Toast and sugar cookies. Full bodied and super toasty in the malt bill. All malts and quite nice. Nice ample bitterness from the yeast and mild hops. Good maple sweetness. Dark dried fruit and a sugary note. Nicely done.
"
1," (750ml bottle) Purchased at the SAQ Casino in Hull, QC. Pours a slight straw colour. Mildly texture with flavours of a white wine, wooden cask and moss. The finish is rather sour. A decent Quebec cider.
"
1," Hamilton Place. The body was light copper with an off white head. The aroma was rich bread and caramel. There was also some iced black tea. The taste was black tea with some dusty caramel. Good for the style.
"
1," AUG 23, 2003 did not like it"
1," I refuse to even get into detail on this one...absolutely AWESOME...just find it, and buy it...Seriously dont even read any more ratings...Just get your keys...go blow the $9...and enjoy.
"
1," Aroma of sour apples and sugary fruit. Yeasty sediment makes for a translucent pour, head went away quickly. Flavor had some caramel character along with ripe fruit. Palate was mildly lively. Decent, but I expect more from a Trappist beer.
"
1," This is a elegant beer if that is possible. Good body, smooth, sweet taste. A great celebration beer. Champagne-like.
"
1," JAN 24, 2010 	Name"
1," poured thick black with small head that slowly crept up from the bottom of the glass and disapeared quickly.  Aroma of coffee- taste is ok - not overly complex but drinkable
"
1," Surprisingly sparkling. The alcohol is very well hidden. I like this, but Id rather have a Westmalle Dubbel.
"
1," Bottle.  Mild malt and hops aroma with slight metallic tones.  Golden yellow color with moderate head.  Strong malt flavor with light hops finish.  NIce body.  A very pleasant and drinkable pils.
"
1," The small bottle.The only Chimay Ive drunk recently (its discounted in Tescos!). It looks lovely in the glass, a deep translucent ruby, with a good head. Slightly fruity and lighter than I expected. Nice, Ive got 5 more to drink and Im looking forward to it.
"
1," Poured from the bottle this beer appears a dark copper with a nice creamy head. Aroma is fruity with that distinct belgian yeast tone. Flavor is spicy on the tongue with plenty of banana bread maltiness rounded out by a slight bitter in the finish. Fizzy on the palate with medium body and a smooth coating of fruit tones left behind. Well balanced and well crafted...god bless the monks.
"
1," Boo ya.  have a chimay.   What you care I say, Aye?   Smooth as butter toffee across my palate.  the malt/hop balance leans in favor of the first, leaning towards a caramel hot.  Ill say this as my ""Whammo!!"" comment, as if youre going to base your purchasing decision of this legacy on what my gray matter retells.... Ive never had such a warm aftertaste mellow of the alcohols completely fill my mouth like this before.  Its not whiskey-hot; its warm as a 9% should be.  Definition of clean finish.  Now stop reading this and drink a damned Grande Reserve!!!!
"
1," Bottle in Yerevan. Dark golden with a white head. Medium sweet and pretty grainy. Not much bitterness, but a hint of alcohol in the finish. Definitely one best widely available pale lagers in Armenia. Usually there wasnt a huge selection available, but Kilikia is very common, followed by Kotayk Lager and different beers from Gyumri.
"
1," lovely. Very palatable, lovely aftertaste. Aroma smells of pubs and wormwood scrubs and too many scouser beatings. (I swear on my life, I wrote that first and then the tune came on, the cosmic ballet continues) Another hideously drunk rate but this is tasting damn good. My favourite Chimay? So far, tops the tripel anyway. Really really nice. Remember to buy this.
"
1," aromas of floral hops and belgian yeast. some spiciness in the aroma.	some malty nuttiness, sweetish fruits like white grapes, caromel, cookie dough, hop bitterness, floral flavors. Fairly light  compared to like rochefort. still kicks the ass of a lot of beers.
"
1," not as tasty or as easy on the mouth as the Blue, but comparable. Fruited tastes with dark colors. Fragrant.
"
1," Pours yellow with copper highlights. Huge rocky head. The aroma has grapefruit, lemon, pine, and biscuit. The flavor is very citric. Grapefruit, orange, caramel, lemon, white pepper and biscuit. Solid brew.
"
1," My first Trappist/Belgian Strong Ale, in 1 pint 9 oz bottle.  Deep brown color, opaque reddish-brown when held up to the light.  Massive, slowly-dissapating light tan head with excellent lacing.  Soft aroma of citrus and florals.  A veritable cornucopia of flavors - some nuttiness, very sweet and citrusy, a little bit of spiciness.  Alcohol is noticable, along with a slightly metallic taste.  Very carbonated.  Pretty easy on the palate.  This beer could easily compete with fine wines.  One of the best...ever.
"
1," Tight brown head over a dark red/rich brown beer.  Carbonation fine and consistent.  musty/fruity/sour aroma.  Taste of malt with a back of the throat bitterness and notable alcohol.  Some light lacing as the beer recedes....
"
1," NOV 25, 2009 Pours a dense, opaque, dark brown with a beige head. Quite a lot of silt dwelling in here. Warm aroma of raisins, peach, green apple roasted malt, and a lot of yeast. Flavor is dark fruit and yeast, with plenty of sweet malt and spices. Alcohol warming on the finish. Yummers.
"
1," Bottle poured into a shaker.  Large 2 finger head. Sweet malt taste. Not much of an aroma.    Slight coffee and chocolate notes.  Light carbonation    A good sessionable Brown Ale. Look forward to trying more of Barley Islands offerings.
"
1," 500ml swingtop bottle at sokol in ljubljana. unfiltered hazed light gold colored body with a firm, fine-bubbled white head.  first whiff is honey and sweet cream, some sweet green vegetables (sugar snap peas, green beans), some sweetened pine nut oil; strange but enjoyable.  herbal flavor and creamy carbonation, light body.  oily at times.  unlike anything Ive tasted, and certainly the best beer to be found in slovenia.
"
1," Pours a dark amber with a slightly tanned head. Sweet with aromas of raisins and prunes. Slightly yeast and peppery. Medium to full bodied. Strong sweet, dry finish.
"
1," My first corked beer (I know, I know) and my second Belgian Ale. This blew the Witkap Pater out of the water (does that rhyme?) but I still feel it was lacking in some areas. Copper colored with an insanely thick head. Mellow fruit undertones are about all that stood out to me. I am looking forward to trying the Bleu.
"
1," (07.25.06) One pint 9.4 oz brown bottle from DiCarlos, Mundelein, IL. Vintage 11/05. 9% ABV. Sweet malt aroma. Poured hazy brown with medium off-white head. Soft carbonation. Medium-to-full bodied ale that starts dry with light malt/fruit (raisin)/caramel/spicy flavors. Finished dry with light bitterness.  A pretty good Belgium ale.
"
1," Bottle Pours out a nice mahogany topped with a sand head. Aroma of yeast fruit and malt. Tast sweetness of fruit. A nice spice on it along with plenty of malt. Man all 3 of the easy to get Chimay are pretty solid.
"
1," Sampled draught at Pivovarna Adam Ravbar, Domzale, Slovenia. -this beer is made by mixing Svetlo and Temno, dark amber colored, not so good like other two because its very watery
"
1," Bottle - Pours reddish brown with a frothy off white head.  Nice mix of spice and fruit in the aroma.  Smooth mouth feel. The alcohol comes through nicely in the taste.
"
1," It pours a nice deap dark brown with a light tan head.  Wonderfull aromas with a blend of fruits and malts.  Its taste is well ballance bettwen its sweetness of brown sugars, fruits and caramellized hops.  One of the most flavorfull and pleasant beers to drink.  Must take the time to enjoy this delicasy.
"
1," Bottled.Black and poured with no head whatsoever.Slight trace of liquorice and plenty of body for a 3.9 per center.Left no lacing.Reasonable and mildly interesting without setting the world alight.
"
1," 07-07 	Pours dark red/brown, with a nice head that flees faster than a thief at a dinner party.  Noticable aromoa of plums/fruit/alcohol (brandy-ish).  Taste is bold, and fruity.  The high alcohol content is hidden by the sweet dried fruit flavor. The mouth is a bit lighter than I would prefer, but I did not find it overly carbonated as others seem to.  	Excellent as dessert or on a cold evening.  	Need to put a few of these in the cellar.
"
1," This is an awfully good beer.  Sampled from the small and large bottles at a friends wine shop.  Seems to improve in sweetness and mellowness as it warms.  Full flavored without being heavy or leaving to much of an aftertaste.
"
1," AUG 18, 2007 Summed rating for two experiences (5/05 and 8/07)"
1," Chimay Grand Reserve pours to a beautiful, deep garnet color with a thick, rocky white head, and a very vibrant carbonation. The nose is filled with complex aromas. Aromas of spicy/musty yeast, marry with fruity estery aromas of plum, candy sugar, sweet malt, peppery alcohol, and herby hop character. The palate is firm, with big sweet and dark malt flavors paired with flavors of rock candy, fruity esters, and a back drop of spicy yeastiness. This beer finishes with more of those complex flavors up front, then ends with a warming, peppery alcoholic burn. 		 Some age in the cellar has taken those raw, young aromas and flavors of a young bottle, and make them more complex and deep. The aromas are more yeasty and spicy in nature, with a bit more malt and alcohol aroma, and a more rounded estery fruit note. The plummy notes will  become more vinous and port like.  A few years of age will  make a phenomenal beer even more complex, and delicious. 		This is a world class Trappist ale, and one of the most accessible of all the Trappist ales. It should be available in most US markets. Chimay has done more than any Trappist brewery to make beer lovers aware of these very special beer styles. This beer is the perfect match for strong blue veined cheeses, cured or smoked meats and fish. It also makes a wonderful after dinner drink, and a warming winter brew. Remember you can consume this beer either young or old, I have enjoyed it both ways.
"
1," Small Bottle - Pour is an opaque redish brown with a frothy half inch thick head.. Aroma is of sweet malts and fruit... Taste is one up on the white but not as good as the blue.. its slightly fruity but it has a tin like aftertaste that im not fond of...   not the best chimay but quite good...
"
1," Pungent northwest hops start.  Crystal clear, golden color with white head.  Piney, sap-like flavor starts, supported by crystal malts.  Bitterness hangs around for a while.  Medium body with acidic like finish.  Easy to drink, but has a bitterness that doesnt leave.
"
1," Very deep, rich, dark amber color. Smallish creamy white foamy head. Decent, but minimal, retention. Almost no lacing.		Big caramel notes on the forefront. Deep, dark fruits that are just a day away from being overripe. Nice, rich malt profile. Nice yeasty quality.		Taste is pretty light, compared to the nose. Nice malty presence, though really not very sweet. Quite earthy and yeasty, actually. Possibly over-carbonated, IMO.		Mouthfeel is creamy enough, but nothing to right home about. The overdone carbonation really hurts it, I think.		I would think of this as a good starter dubbel. 	My least fave from Chimay.
"
1," Bottle @ Coles Buffalo NY. Poured into a Chimay glass. Amberish Brown with nice pillowy head. Lots of dried fruit. Love this beer.
"
1," AUG 16, 2003    I liked this better than the white...It was smoother and more flavorful. Fruity, almost minty malt flavor, vinous yet still somewhat creamy texture. Slightly spicy, lightly yeasty.  Could have packed a little more flavor I suppose, as this is a bit light for a trappist but definitely has a great head retention and almost perfect balance,  Fabulous beer.
"
1," Butterscotch almost overshadows the toasted, biscuity malts in the nose with no hop aromas apparent.  Lightly hazy copper coloured body is topped by a thick and lasting cream coloured head that recedes to a lasting cover with some lacing.  Lots of butterscotch in the flavour also though floral hops and biscuity malts are notable as well.  Bitterness is subdued.  Medium body with moderate carbonation.  Sampled on tap with Oakes and CapFlu at Sailor Hagars in North Van in May 2007.
"
1," Small Bottle - Poured into an authentic Chimay chalice from the gift set... Very dark brown with a small tan head... Nose is malt and grapes.. Tounge is a complex combonation of malts and sweetness.. with alot of champange like carbonation..   awsome tasting beer in my opinion
"
1," Questa birra, di colore rosso ambrato e dalla schiuma compatta di media persistenza, allolfatto sprigiona piacevoli e astringenti sentori di frutti di bosco. Buono il corpo, ha un gusto dolce, elegante nel suo complesso. il finale  bilanciato con note luppolate.
"
1," (swing top bottle, 33cl, purchased at the breweries own drinks market a couple of days ago) Hazy, pale golden colour with a big and blond foamy head. Yeasty and slightly doughy pale malty aroma with notes of citrus, barnyard/sweat and a tinge of floral and slightly herbal hops. Moderately sweet flavour, light to medium bodied with a moderate carbonation. Soft malty base with subtle notes of citrus and flowery hops; malty and mildly hoppy finish. Pretty good one but I prefer the more matured Keltengold. 09.V.10
"
1," mmmmm...this is a great beer,Lots and lots of taste,nice sweetnes,the taste stays with u all night (in a pleasant way =) )

1," Hardly known, only available at te abbey itself and on its way to become the 8th official trappist beer...

1," Grande Rserve en Magnum au Pub Italia, Ottawa, ON. Merci Dumdum! Robe brune surmonte dune mousse beige persistente en dentelle. Dpts de levure. Armes de raisins et de malt. Saveurs de chocolat, de raisins, de dattes, de prunes, de caramel, de malt, dalcool et dpices. Corps moelleux.
"
1," One of the first Belgian Strong Ales I tried.  Lots of figs, raisins, citrusy fruits and brown sugar flavor.  Deep amber/brown color and bubbly white head.
"
1," Beautiful beer.  Man, theres a lot going on in this brew!  Cant tell if I like it or not, but man is it full of different flavors!  Worth a try.
"
1," Hazy gold  ale with barley any head.  Slightly off chemical perfume aroma with beginning of band aid and apples.	Nice hops and malts but the beer is definitely off, as there is a long sourness, almost grainy in post taste. If it was fresh, this could be good.
"
1," Excellent beer from an excellent company.  Rich dark color with roasted malt aroma.  Smooth and pleasing on the palate with a burst of fruit and spice flavor.
"
1," bottle. pours a crystalline red with a tall, long lasting off-white head. The aroma is sharp and astringent with hints of dough, caramel, berries, and chalk. This is pretty bitter stuff, but not in a good way. It cuts my palate with a chalky sting that fades to something like Twizzlers. On the upside some fruity and biscuity flavors make this quaffable, but I wouldnt right home to mom about it.
"
1," Brown in color with  beige head. Aroma and taste is of prune, malt, chocolate, and yeast.  This is one of the best very widely distributed beers.  I prefer the bottle to the top version myself.  Good with food because it has a solid but not overpowering flavor that complements rather than dominates.
"
1," Bottle @ Coles Buffalo NY. Poured into a Chimay Glass. Amber Brown in color. Taste & aroma difficult to describe for a nubian like myself. Delicious
"
1," The first beer I tried from this breewer and I must admit I tasted good
"
1," Bottle.  Pours a dark amber color  with a large, just a bit off-white head.  Lacing is good.  Aromas of port, apricot, orange, and roasted malts.  Nice mouthfeel with a creamy start and an oily finish.  Flavors of malts, wine, and more citrus fruit.  Wonderful beer.
"
1," Wasnt all that bad but definitely not great. The aroma was flat yet was there. Malty tasting. Slightly sweet. Pours nice with a tan head. Malty and roasty, but nothing inspiring.
"
1," Bottle, pours a hazy brown beer with a big beige head.  aroma is sweet yeast and malt.  Very sweet smooth flavor with a light hop and mostly balanced yeast.  Very nice beer to sip hard

1," Those monks sure know how to make good beer.

1," [Eyes] Cloudy dark ambar red color with a nice foamy white head. 	[Nouse] The aroma is full and floral with plenty of sweet fruits. 	[Mouth] Full body nice shoot af good belgium abbey beer. The finish is good and large, some notes of black sugar, wow!!!
"
1," Pours a brown color with a light tan head.  Aroma is malty and nutty.  Flavor is malty, roasty, and slightly nutty.
"
1," Loop IPA) Nice IPA, orange/bronze color with a creamy puffy head and lacing down the sides of the sampler. The aroma is very floral and citrusy, a tad musty if I might say though. The flavor was fairly well balanced and had a strong malt backbone. The finish was a little more astringent that what I usually find in an IPA, but it was well worth trying.

1," Skunked as Hell.  I did drink it at room temp.  Fizzy, yellow, immediate nasty burps.  More interesting (although I not sure better) than Budmillercoors.
"
1," Deep, dark copper color with a short lived foamy head. Smooth, fruity overtones with a slightly bitter finish mellowing, again, into a refreshing fruity aftertaste.
"
1," Pours dark reddish brown with a mostly receding wispy tan head. Aroma of nuts. caramel, alefruits and crackery crystal malt. Taste is sweet chocolate, toffee, mild English hoppiness with some of the earthy characteristics I like from Fuggles. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with soft carbonation. Pretty easy drinking, quaffable brown ale.
"
1," Picked up a single 11.2 oz bottle from Cellars Wine & Spirits in St Paul, MN. Pours a dark burnt copper brew with a thick fizzy off white head that slowly dissolves to a fine film. Very nice lacing. Aroma of yeast, barley malt, some raisin, and a touch of caramel. Taste soft, sweet, a touch of brown sugar and some molasses. Finish has some sweet aftertaste and smooth. A full-bodied ale. My favorite of the three exported Chimays.
"
1," The DUBBEL everyone must have once in their life.  This was the first Belgian beer I had when I was 20, and boy my taste buds were never the same again!
"
1," pour was dark with a very dark brown head.  Aroma was of chocolate, coffee, and dark roasted malt.  Flavor was coffee dominated melding well with light chocolate, malt, and a light bitterness. Well blended.  Good.  May buy again.
"
1," I like this beer a lot.  I think, based on its availability and taste, it should be in everyones frig.
"
1," A sweet initial flavor that transitions to long lasting, medium bitter, malty finish.  It has an amber appearance and creamy head with nice lacing.  The taste grows on you and I find myself looking for another bottle.  Those Trappist Monks to a great job!

"
1," This is a very good beer, I had it on draft at 310 in Winter Park- served in a trappist glass.  Good pour, it had very little head.  Aroma is of light fruit with banana and a slight citrus.  It tastes like most other tripels with the yeasty malt flavor and a bit light in the mouthfeel.  I like it, but would not go out of the way to find it.
"
1," 09/02 date on cork, sampled 03/03.  High pressure in the bottle when opened at cellar temp.  PPoured with huge head, to be expected with the apparent carbonation.  Nice reddish brown color with iny fine bubble rising.  Aroma is dry and malty with a light nuttyness.  Flavor is hard to pin down, not overbearing, it is warm and malty / nutty.  Nice fuzzyness on the tounge with a little bit of hops in the finish.  I had this once about 6 months ago and it find it better than I remember.
"
1," Poured as usual into the ol Chimay goblet.  Golden in color, with a thin white head that leaves lots of lacing.		Smell is a bit underwhelming, with spices and mustiness.		Taste is medicinal with lots of spices and yeast.  Theres also a bright estery fruitiness.  Some booziness is apparent here.		Carbonation is a bit high.  Lightness in body contributes to the booziness taking over the palate with too much warmth.
"
1," Pours amber in color. Strong carbonation, bubbly on the tongue. Smells of citrus, some dark fruits,and some floral hoppy notes. Taste leads with a few bitter notes and then transforms into what you get in the nose with a slight alcohol twist.
"
1," 01/08 0.5 l fliptop bottle at Sokol restaurant. Poured nice slightly murky golden body with medium sized head. Very nice, healthy hops aroma (herbal, lemon) and some honey malts. Promising, but flavor wasnt nearly so good. Bitter, hop dominated flavor (herbs, grass, spicy) but very thin bodied.  Dry, medium-long finish. Very pleasant, but so watery... Maybe this varies depending of the batch...
"
1," On tap at the Hamilton Place location. The body was deep yellow with a white head. The aroma was meaty with some grass notes. There was also some bread. The taste was light bread crust with some beets. Good for the style.
"
1," In my opinon the best of the red/white/blue Chimay beers. The color is a dark amber, almost reddish brown. The head is think and dissipates fairly quickly. the flavor is not as sweet as the other chimay ales. There is a slight bitterness which is  appriciated, the other chimays are amost too sweet for my taste.
"
1," 12oz bottle from the Sahara Mart in Bloomington, IN. Pours a cloudy, golden colored body with a finger-width, frothy, white head that dissipates quickly and leaves a moderate lacing. Aroma is somewhat grainy wheats with some light citrus and straw. Flavor is a bit better. More of a citrus aspect with some almost tart lemons, a sweeter wheat, and a light straw. Finishes with a touch of tartness from the citrusy lemons and a very light straw bitterness. Somewhat dry with a medium length aftertaste following a light, smooth, clean body and light carbonation. Overall, a decent wheat beer. Definitely refreshing and easy drinking, but nothing special. This would be okay on a blazing hot day.
"
1," Had this on cask at Rock Bottom in Atlanta.  It sent me here to rate it.  Poured a slightly hazy dark amber with a small white head.  Aroma of pine, citrus and some vanilla (?).  Flavor was excellent.  Mouthfeel was creamy, which set up the muted grapefruit flavor, that was excellently backed by malt balance.  Finish was piney.  Medium body with soft carbonation.
"
1," Ruby body.  Looks very rich and delicious.  Huge white foamy head that stays around for awhile.  Before opening, I notice a good amount of yeast residue, I guess from the bottle conditioning. Overall, this was probably a good Belgium to start with.
"
1," [330ml bottle from Tescos, Reading] My first Trappist beer so I was quite excited!  Smell and initial taste very malty.  Smooth and dangerously drinkable for such a strong beer.  Mellows into a deep fruity aftertaste with almost no bitterness.  Not bad, but not quite as outstanding as Id been led to believe a Trappist beer could be - Ive certainly had British beers I prefer.  Will definitely try more of the style though.

"
1," AUG 20, 2009 On tap @ the Crescent Moon.  Clear amber with a small off-white head, fading to a film before long.  Aroma of some toasted malts and old citrus hops.  The flavor is fairly biscuity with a little caramel malts.  Some citrusy hops are around as well.    The finish is semi-dry with bitterness around a 3.  Light prickly carbonation with a light body.  For a pale lager, this isnt bad at all.  Also, not bad for a flagship beer.  If I lived in Omaha, though, Id pick most Boulevard beers over this as a go-to beer, for probably less money as well.
"
1," 750ml - cork says 11/04 - Pungent aroma of Belgian yeast, candi sugar, raisin, cocoa, and some tasty smelling spices.  Pours a deep mahagony with a small head and good lacing.  Flavor matches aroma with the alcohol showing up, but not in ""hot"" way.  Palate is sticky and sweet.  Carbonated mouthfeel helps keep each drink fresh.  A wonderfully drinkable Belgian strong.
"
1," .75 liter bottle.  .  Nice red color with a creamy head, very inviting smells of fruit and oak.  Taste is sweet with hints of fruit and caramel, well carbonated almost too much.  Sweet stickiness afterwords brings a need for water.
"
1," This looks identical to Chimay Rouge,which is the classic beautiful copper colour.	This is like it has had a spoon full of sugar added to it and although it is sweeter than the Rouge,I like it.This is a cracker!!
"
1," This is a great looking beer. If you are looking for a beer that you can just sit down and throw back than leave this beer alone. It is a beer to savour and enjoy. I loved it. The only thing I dont like is the strong alcohol taste it leaves on your palate. This is easily forgotten though because the beer is a masterpiece that will never let you down.
"
1," not a big beer but a full-flavored example of a summer quaffer.
"
1," Roasted malts, fruity raisen soaked alchohol smell. Head is off white and lasts. Very full bodied. A great beer.
"
1," Passable lager gotten in trade.  Some malty aroma, some white head on light golden colour.  A tad light mouthfeel, easy drinking. Pure example of style.
"
1," (Draught)  Pours a clear golden body with a small white head.  Nearly nonexistent aroma; light butter and grain.  Flavor of malt with slightly skunky hops.
"
1," nice looking pour, black w/ a creamy head. dry roasty, but a bit thin on the palate. nice, but not outstanding
"
1," Bottle 50 cl. Pours a clear, deep golden with a white head. Sweetish malty nose. Medium body with lightly sweet malts and a whiff of sulphur. Dry and lightly bitter finish. Pleasant. 090209
"
1," Pours black with big tan head.  Like the other Barley Island I tried, much too carbonated for the style.  Roasted malt and very light coffee in the aroma, and also a bit medicine-like.  A little bit of coffee in the aroma, but it is carried away with the over-the-top carbonation.  Thin on the palate.  Dont know how long ago bottled.  Either old bottles or poor process control leading to the medicinal aromas and flavors and high carbonations from this brewer.
"
1," This was a ""Grand Reserva 2001"" and it was very nice. Chimay Bleue was one of the first decent, not danish beers i drank. And i recommended it to a lot of other people, also girls who claimed that they didnt like beer. But after tasting this, and other beers diffrient than a standard danisk pilsner, they are now beerdrinkers. The colour is brown/red, small white head. Smell of malts, dark-maltbread. Tastes of malt, raisins, berries, sweet, caramel, spices. Nice.
"
1," Hazy straw body with a nice head.  Nose is citrus (orange and lemon) with spicy notes.  Flavour is wheaty and citrusy and very comfy in the mouth.  A great Wit by a great brewpub.
"
1," Amber/red aolour with a thin, creamy, but unfortunately not persistent head. The taste is hoppy and fruity, less sweet than other Chimays. The aftertaste has traces of vanilla. What can I say? I love trappist beers!
"
1," Westmalle or St. Bernardus 6
"
1," nice dark brown on the pour with a nice thick head that had to settle for a few minutes.  smelled of malts with sweet notes in there somewhere.   not bad not bad on the palate at all, medium body and not too much aftertaste.
"
1," Compliments of Uncle Steve!  Pours a dark copper color with a nice head that retains nicely, sort of an off white color.  Aroma is mild but sweet and refreshing.  taste is malt and hops with the hops punching through.  Mouthfeel is OK.  Back side is good but doesnt jump out like other IPAs.  A good session beer.
"
1," Thanks Chuck!  The appearance is a thick, bubbly/creamy off-white head that fully stays.  The body is a weird brown color.  It bubbles more than champagne.  Excellent lacing provides a nice appearance.  The aroma is yeasty, cinnamon, bananas, cloves, grain, apricot.  The flavor is yeasty, hay, alfalfa, cloves, cinnamon, something weird I cant pinpoint.  The palate is watery with a light/medium mouthfeel.  Extremely carbonated.
"
1," Sweet cloying flavour with a stale bitter finish.  eh....
"
1," MAY 8, 2009 Richmond Summer Gathering. Bomber courtesy of jcwattsrugger. Clear, deep brown with a thin, ringed tan head. Mild coffee and chocolate nose, yeasty, seemed a bit infected to me, with some sour nut notes. Didnt really seem to crop up in the flavor. OK - Id like to get another one of these and re-rate.		Re-rate, Daytona 500 tasting. 750 from DragonStout, IIRC. Much better this go-round, none of the sour nut I noted before. Rate reflects this bottle.
"
1," This is one of my favorite beers.  I tend to lean to the lighter beers (no insult to darks intended).  Strong, smooth and no hang with you bitter tatse.  Not to heavy so I can enjoy it with my meal.  Definitely a growler fill up with this one.
"
1," Bottle.  Pours a nice deep mahogany color with a moderate creamy off white head.  Lacing is minimal.  Light bread dough aroma with some fruitiness.  Big malt, bread type flavor, some fruit in the taste as well and a little corn.  Medium body and slightly creamy on the palate.  Finish is slightly bitter.  A very easy drinking beer.
"
1," Beautiful deep amber pour with a nice fluffy off-white head.  Great lacing results!  Very inviting aroma of sweet grapefruit, candy, and pine.  Full, chewy mouthfeel.  It starts sweet with caramel and sugared grapefruit and nicely transitions to a pine and bitter citrus finish.  A very good IPA.
"
1," Bottle. BB 2005. Pours a hazy amber color with an off-white head. Has a fruity maalty and a little ueasty aroma with hints of dark fruit. Sweet malty dark fruit flavor with hints of yeast and honey. Has a warming sweetish malty finish with some hints of dark fruit in the aftertaste.
"
1," Medium brown color, large lacy head. Malty, fruity and spicy. Smooth mellow taste. Lots of flavor, complex and subtle. Hint of apricot, banana, vanilla and other spices and aromas. Mouthfeel is very full and round. Finish is smooth and dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Great beer. My favorite of the red, white and blue.
"
1," 330ml bottle in namesake chalice.  Murky orange colour under a small fizzy head.  Sediment laden.  Aromas of orange,hops, dried apricot and yeast.  Fruit and pepper come through strong...alcohol is felt and welcomed all the way down to the gut.  Well crafted to say the least.
"
1," I was expecting something else but this one isnt as good as I thought but nice nontheless.  A bit bitter for my taste in the end.  Long lasting aftertaste with a hint of coffie. Nice with a good meal.
"
1," Pours a cloudy dark golden color with a medium white head. Solid aroma of citrusy, coniferous hops with caramel. Very good flavor of coniferous, citrusy, bordering on green hops with  caramel and a lasting bitterness. The body is light to medium with a creamy texture and moderate carbonation. This is a well balanced and very enjoyable IPA.
"
1," Cask handpull at Cherry Tree, Canterbury.  Drank with Ang just after Christmas.  Good best bitter with some earthy hop. Mid brown bit of amber. Decent brown bitter in very good nick.  Loved the roasty toasty malts.  Proper darkish brown bitter.
"
1," I still havent tasted anything better than this. Killer aroma. Nice foamy top.
"
1," 22 oz bottle pours a dark chestnut body with a one inch khaki head. Aroma is subtle, with perfumey florals, anise, and a sweet maltiness. Medium body supports some dark roasty notes, candy sugar, anise, dark fruits, and floral hops. Nicely complex and a good sipper.
"
1," A golden ale with a thin lacing  white head. A rather chalky lemony aroma. In aroma, a rather thin malt, with mushed peas, veggies. so-so. On tap at brewpub Dec. 30 2008.
"
1," Draft at Downtown Chattanooga location		Dark opaque pour with a nice tan head. Sweet stout up front, with a touch of licorice ending.
"
1," Bottle 35,5 cl. Courtesy of KimJohansen. Clear orangey brown with a small off-white head. Intense aroma of caramel, overripe fruit and alcohol. Quite full-bodied, sweet roasted malts, overripe fruit and caramel with a yeasty edge. Warming alcoholic finish. More like a Quad really. 300809
"
1," I dont know if theyve changed the recipe since I last had this, but it seems to be improved.  Pale golden, creamy white head.  Pale malt aroma with some light honey underneath but also a fairly assertive Saaz aroma.  Spicy flavour with a touch of breadiness.  Lingering bitterness.  Quite a surprise, actually.
"
1," Thanks to Bobby91w for including this one as an extra! Pours black, with a thin-ish tan head that dissipates surprisingly quickly for a stout. Aroma of stale coffee (spent espresso grounds) some oak, and a bit of molasses. Very dry. At first, you think the stale coffee is going to steal the show, but after a second, you start to detect some sweeter undertones - the malts begin to show through the bitter front end. Its still very dry - some smokey meats coming through as well - but is far more pleasant than it first lets on. This would be fantastic with a good protein-laden dinner - Im thinking ribs with a good bbq sauce. Very decent overall.
"
1," (33cl bottle, with thanks to pivnizub) Clear, pale golden colour with a short foamy white head. Quite strong grassy hops aroma with a light-sweet malty background. Initially slightly sweet malty taste with grassy hops; light to medium bodied, crispy carbonation; dry and bitter, grassy hoppy finish. This one tastes more like a Pils from the Sauerland and has not much in common with those brewed in the Bohemian style.
"
1," malts, prunes + citron-like alcoholic touch. Easy to drink despite being quite full-bodied malty. Palate is not extremely complex. Gives alcoholic kick in the finish.
"
1," Hazy copper with good, creamy beige head / Nose of burnt sugar / Light to medium body, some creaminess, light hops and decent finish / Overwhelming flavor of burnt sugar, with dry hop notes / A very pleasant beer, but its not an ipa.  More of a Vienna lager with a touch of hops.
"
1," medium fruity  hoppy/citrus aroma. pours golden with red hues, nice full body head.  fizzy/citrus at the front with nice bitterness in the hops, smoothed out by the citrus.
"
1," Amber colour with a dense off-white head. Piney and pineappley aroma-very sweet and hoppy at the same time. Medium-bodied; Shows a decent hop flavour with a bit of maltiness. Overall, pretty average...not a strong showing of the style. I had this on draught at Big River (owned by Gordon Biercsh) in Chattanooga, Tennesse on 26-September-2003.
"
1," Deep ruby hue.  Big fruity nose of plums, bananas, chocolate.  Beige sticky head with nice lacing.  Sweet malts, raisons, yeast, spices, medium bodied, gentle carbonation.  Let this warm please.  Very smooth and well balanced.  A classic no doubt.
"
1," Outstanding. Citra is what it claims to be - but not to the exclusion of what we want in an IPA. The citrus is mild and compliments the hops perfectly. Bitterness is not overwhelming - not sure of the IBU rating but I would put it at 60-70. Delightfully bold but smooth.
"
1," Pours a very cloudy, hazy brown with a very thin head. Some spice and fruit flavors. Lot of carbonation. Very good beer.

1," Dark fruit and a hint of alcohol in the aroma.  The flavor is fruity, possibly raspberry/strawberry and malty.  Not quite at the top but very solid and a good ale either way.
"
1," Hop nose with a smooth beginning, malty middle and bitter finish. Needs a little more balancing.
"
1," APR 24, 2007 Pint on tap at the Seven Bridges Brewpub in Jacksonville.  I dont know why this is lumped in with the brewpub in Chattanooga.  Pretty good for a brewpub brew.  Beautiful dark pour with a creamy tan head.  Mild dark malt and chocolate aroma.  Flavor was very good with coffee, chocolate and roased malts coming through.  Smooth, sweet, and creamy with no off flavors except a bit salty.  Very enjoyable and drinkable.
"
1," Bubblegum licorice malty smell.	Pinkish amber color with an apple juice hue and a minimal frothy off white head. Lots of funnelling carbonation action and some suspended sediment.	Smooth and rich taste of sweet malt with a minor sweet sourness.	Medium bodied, resinous in the direction of syrupy, and the funneling carbonation is soft and fizzy.	A very good Dubbel, whether a session beer or not could be debatable, how its served, and how its prepared to be served.
"
1," bottle.  clear yellow, white head.  sweaty nose of plastic, glass, dried noble hops; medium skunkiness, medium to heavy pungency.  somewhat syrupy body.  lighter and dried finish; heavily pungent and dry but still malt liquor-like.
"
1," DEC 21, 2006 The beer pours a hazy reddish brown with flashes of a garnet-red. Pour produced a massive, fluffy, creamy off-white head.  Nose of malt with a sweet and a strong spicy note, yeasty with hints of plums and raisins and just a hint of herbaceous hops. Silky mouth-feel with a crisp champagne-like carbonation and a medium body. Flavors reflect aroma with a heavy clove flavor initially which persists throughout the drinking session. Malts and caramel along with chocolate and dark toffee. Dried fruit notes call to mind figs and plums. Finish is fairly dry with a balanced bitterness. Excellent!
"
1," MAY 19, 2005 March 2002"
1," Cask at brewery - I  must first mention that I am not a fan of the non-blackberry version of this beer. The aroma is strong bourbon with subtle blackberry. Pours black with a brown ring head and good lacing. Flavor is roasted dark malts, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon and a touch of berry. I think the berry mellows the bourbon in this case.  Palate is sticky.  Overall I think the bourbon is still too much but the blackberry has a way of mellowing it out which I liked.  It just didnt have anything for me to grab on to.  Different and worth a try none the less.

1," JUL 26, 2010 33 cl bottle, pours dark ruby with a nice big creamy head, solid retention, aroma is caramel, brown sugar and yeast, taste is dark fruits, yeast and  malt caramel, excellent dubbel.

1," Pours very dark with nice head and lacing. Aroma is of yeast, caramel, and fruitiness. Taste is similar to port but a dancing foam on the palate. Caramelly with a bit of alcohol. Fantastic with desert.
"
1," Pours a nice red body, coming up to a thick head. Aromas are yeasty and spicy, light overall however. Flavors of dried citrus and dark fruits coat the taste buds in a mellow smooth taste. Undertones of light hops and brown sugar offer a nice twist of tastings. Drinkable stuff here.

1," Cloudy light yellow in color with a sweet spicy banana aroma. Spicy citrus banana flavours, dry.

1," Pours a ruddy amber with a finger of cream head, some decent retention. Yeasty nose, some caramel, bready, sweet, plum. Medium sweet, caramel, spicy and bready yeast. Bitterness enough to offset the sweetness. Creamy mouthfeel, medium carb, light body.
"
1," FEB 20, 2004 Pours dark brown with an enormous head.  Very cloudy.  Sweet malt, caramel and alcohol aroma.  Very sweet flavor balanced by a hoppy bitter finish and a dry alcohol aftertaste.  Very complex flavor; raisins, plums, toffee.  A little acidic.  Nicely carbonated.  The alcohol is apparent, but not unpleasant.  This is one of the best beers I have had.  	Re-Rate"

1," (draft 7/30/10). Clear gold color. Small white head. Light sweet grain aroma. Same flavor, with very light bitterness. Avg duration. Smooth finish. Thin texture. Moderate carbonation. Fair lacing.
"
1," Bottle courtesy of qdog.  Eruptive head.  The damn thing pours like an angry, agitated Belgian beer.  Head is tan.  Deep brown color with red tones.  Nice aroma, malty with bourbon notes.  Palate is destroyed by the carbonation.  Fizzes like baking soda and vinegar in the mouth.  Flavor does carry some roasted malt but the bourbon really comes out in taste.  Probably would be really nice if the carbonation was toned down.
"
1," Excellent beer. Very smooth and not too harsh from the high alcohol content. A rich, malty taste with subtle fruit flavor. Pairs amazingly well with pork loin or country ribs.
"
1," Bottle.2006 (2003) at the Culminator, must be the best beer in the world when you lay it away for a good 2-3 years.
"
1," 3 liter bottle	This is a yeast driven malty beer. It went very well with our Thanksgiving dinner. A solid beer, worth revisiting from time to time.
"
1," On draught at the brewpub. Pours black with mahogany fringes, accompanied by a thick tan head and lace. The nose is of roasted chocolates. Flavors bring roasted malt with some light cherries. The finish touches on some licorice. The mouthfeel is very creamy and smooth. This one is light, fluffy and easy drinking.  Not bad.
"
1," To be honest, i expected more of this one. Malty, creamy. The other Chimays are better.
"
1," Looks like a medium ale, hard to detect any spice in aroma.  Minimal head.  Very drinkable, but really, I was expecting a lot more spices.
"
1," 33cl bottle Nose of malt and plums, hazy, dark copper with a medium, but short-lived beige head. Flavor has caramel malts, plums, and spice. The 9% is very well covered.
"
1," AUG 6, 2011 Bottle. The pour was a medium copper in color with an average sized off white foamy head that was mostly lasting and had some what fair lacing. 		The aroma was of a toasted caramel malt, a light resin hop and a sweet yeast with a hint of apricot, banana, dried fruit and some spice (cinnamon and maybe a little nutmeg). 		It tasted very light, sweet and malty with notes of sweet dried fruit and banana in the beginning and finished moderately sweet with a tinge of bitterness that had a nice malty feel to it with notes of caramel and spices at the end. Although I would have liked the flavor to last a nice long while, it only lasted a short time. 		Mouthfeel was light to medium bodied and watery yet somewhat creamy in texture with a flat carbonation. 		Overall a very enticing brew, but anything from this brewer seems to taste well.
"
1," On tap at the Big River Grille in Walt Disney Worlds Boardwalk. Pours a dark black color with a small tan head on top. Aroma is coffee, caramel, chocolate, and malt. The flavor is very similar with coffee taking abundance with hints of chocolate coming in too. A decent beer.
"
1," Sample @ GTMW 09 - Amber pour with a light tan head. Smells of sweet, mellow malt with a bit of hops to balance. Taste is sweet, sweet malt and caramel. It was almost too much, but I guess I was in the mood for sweet. Its smooth and very drinkable, especially for 10%. Good stuff.

"
1," (So... this has cellared 2+ years.) Inky black pour with mahogany highlights under a slow, thick head, the color of wet sand. Potently aromatic, mostly syrupy chocolaty sweetness with strong dark fruit undertones and a finishing punch of Boston-style coffee. Low cola notes late.  Palate is off, mildly syrupy yet spritzy and a bit watered-down. Skim milk? Flavor is spot-on with the aroma, Milk chocolate syrup leads to a bittersweet coffee finish. Mostly enjoyable.
"
1," I like this ""grand reserve"" belgian libation. A fine belgian ale, yet my least favorite trappist. And that's not just because it's easy to find. I simply feel that the alcohol overpowers this ale and covers up the fruity complexities. The thin head and unlively carbonation didn't impress me either.
"
1," Bottle. A triple, are you kidding??? Amber orange color, cloudy. Dried tropical fruit in the subdued aroma. Full bodied. Malty sweet flavor with tangerine, pineapple, dried tropical fruit. Some tart notes in the aftertaste. The alcohol is well hidden.

1," Purchased at West Lakeview Liquors in Chicago, IL as part of a Chimay package w/ a glass, enjoyed while watching week 10 NFL football.  Appearance a very cloudy, murky brown/red with a rich off white head.  Aroma very nice, fruity, very slightly sweet, not really too much of an aroma.  Taste is pretty good, smooth, Belgian yeast presence, fruity (apricot), Ive had the white and I really enjoy it, but with this red Im not as impressed.  Its good, but not great.

1," This is a very unique beer.    Warmly alcoholic and delightful to behold.   The color was very interesting.    While not my favorite Belgium this is certainly worthy.   It has an interesting fruitiness and a terrific aroma.

1," AUG 5, 2005 This was my first belgian and after this I was hooked, very complex flavor with grapes, raisins, vanilla, cherries, and other fruit lurking in the background. Pours dark with a nice head. Aroma of fruit and a hint of alcohol.  RERATE "
1," AUG 31, 2011 Amber color with a beige head. A malty caramel aroma. Flavor is malty with some caramel notes. I into comparing beers tonight so this is Yuengling like. Overall this is a pretty good beer for a session lager.

1," Beautiful full spicy aroma.  Fruit notes.  Color is hazy amber. fruit, and spice on the palate.  very well balanced.  Finishes with the perfect amount of bitterness.  One of my favorite belgians I do believe.

1," I need to try this at home so I can rate it better.  I had it at a tavern and as far as tastes go I love this beer.
"
1," Pours muddy brown with a quickly fading light tan head.  Aroma has some sweet and earthy notes.  Taste is a little funky and sour with some bitterness at the end.  A bit watery but frothy as it goes down.  Im not sure if this bottle was skunked (quite possible) or thats just the direction they went with the style, but it kinda works.  Still, I wish there was more going on.

1," 12 oz bottle. Pours a murky dark brown with fizzy tan head. Aroma is unique, notes of dark fruit, dark roast, molasses, oak and cherry. Flavor is much the same with obvious okay cab notes.

1," almost 100% impervious to light. head is light brown, mostly diminishing. aroma is chalk, chocolate, mild roastiness, lots of whiskey (the barrel aging DEFINITELY comes through in the aroma) and some woodiness. Flavor is pretty much the same as the aroma..the chocolatiness and the whiskey meld seamlessly. mouthfeel is thick enough to make you take notice and not brush this one off.  excellent stout.
"
1," a decent dubbel.  some brown sugar and spice to this one with some weak chocolate and some carmel.  a little thin compared to the other chimay beers but not unlikable, just not up to par.
"
1," Bottle. Patented Belgian yeasty fruit/floral aroma. Murky brown with thick beige foamy head that coats glass. Bubbly, clean yeasty fruit bread taste blends so well you forget the alcohol until youre done. Dryer than many Belgians. Nice after-taste of warm fruit bread too.
"
1," Dark gold body with an orange hue and a thin white head on top. The aroma has some packaged wheat bread with some carrots behind the malt. The taste has some sharp white bread crust and a little bit of raw potatoes. The finish is like hay. A decent, fairly dry brew that is good for summer.
"
1," Bottle.	Clear orange coloured with an off white head.	Aroma of malts, caramel and spices.	Flavour of malts and caramel.
"
1," Disappointing flavour with this Pale Ale.  Along the same lines as Alexander Keiths IPA (not a true IPA).
"
1," MAY 26, 2004 Dark brown body with thick frothy tan head, long lasting.  Fruity aroma and a sweet, tingly, slightly musky flavor. --------&#  Are the big bottles and the little bottles different?  Was told they were.  Probably not.  My 5/25/04 tasting of the big bottle Grand Reserve yeilded the same ratings as my previous taste of the little blue bottle.  Not bad but not great.
"
1," The taste has ripened fruit, fig, yeast and some caramel malts	A"
1," Bottled (BB 01/2005)	Hazy nut brown colour, floating yeast, good tanned and cloudy head. Crisp and sour banana and wheat aroma. Mouthfeel is sour with good-bodied wheat character and crisp citron and lemon flavors. Sourness makes this quite unique beer, also a bit hard to drink in quantities.
"
1," 33cl bottle dark amber with decent head aroma is pretty malty and can slighty smell the alcohol. taste is very smooth and goes down real easy but it just lacked in flavor wasnt very complex and didnt have a ton of flavor to speak of. decent beer but wasnt as good as i had hoped.
"
1," Thanks to atpayne for sending me this brew. I think that the blond chick on the bottle is kind of cute. 	 Pours a hazy blond body and a massive ivory head. The aroma and flavor bring some floral citric notes of orange peels, lemon and grapefruit. There are big spicy black pepper, musty clove and coriander even some pinesap. Some earthy flavors and aromas of Cyprus mulch, and compost. I really dig this beer. Its not over done in any one area and everything seems to bend nicely. Big yeasty body and fat doughy bread notes. Dig It?
"
1, 330 ml. bottle.	Appearance
1," On tap at Noblesville brewery - Aroma is pungent with lots of brett and oak.  Flavor brings forward some toasted malts but quickly falls back to doughy yeast, oak and brett giving it a nice funky sour finish.  Palate is tart and creamy.  A fantastic sour that would draw some attention if it got out of the brewery.
"
1," This was a very drinkable stout but kinda thin and not much in bourbon flavor.I could not even taste were it was aged in barrels and that was kinda of a let down.CHEERS!
"
1," Pours dark brown with a tan head.  Smells nutty with some roasty hints.  Tastes of sweet chocolate, some nutty hints.  Not much going on here.
"
1," Draft. Pours light gold with a white head. Light aroma, generally clean with some grainy notes. The flavor is clean, crisp, and malty, with light grainy notes. Not bad.
"
1," 33cl bottle poured into a Chimay Trappist glass.  Murky dark amber with plenty of long-lasting off-white head.  Aroma is bubblegum.  Flavor is bubblegum and slight alcohol.  Medium carbonation.  Medium finish of alcohol.  Nice, smooth, warming brew.  Excellent dubbel.
"
1," bottle, thanks to mar, chunky white mealy pour with a rubbery aroma, flavor is sour milk, coconut flesh
"
1," pours a dark mahogony color w/ a tall frothy well laced off white head and some carb bubbles flowing up the glass.  Smells of butter, yeast wheat and some dark fruits as well as a light malt.  Palate is highly carbonated ok body decent coating mildly creamy.  Taste is belgian yeast sweet malts dark fruits & carmalized sugar a touch bitter and hints of alcohol.  Overall its not the best stuff ive had but its well above avg.
"
1," 750 ml bottle.  Pours deep browny red in colour, lots of creamy fluffy offwhite head.  Tonnes of lacing.  Big sweet, raisiny sweet aroma and taste,  \some bitterness.  Quite good!
"
1," dark toffee with cocoa accents, sweet, but a light bitterness dries it out a bit. The best of the Dead Frog offerings Ive tried so far, but that doesnt say much.
"
1,"D Tasted while listening to The Beatles ""White Album"" on vinyl. Served at approx. 12 degrees C. 		Pours a deep red-brown with a huge off-white head. Malty nose with toffee and some berry-like sweetness. Mouthfeel is thick, with a low amount of carbonation I find very pleasant. Aroma has hints of caramel, raisins and something I can only describe as ""general fruitiness"", but leaning mostly towards banana. Nice bitterness around the edges. The 9 % abv is quite noticable. Aftertaste is short and malty. Overall Im a little disappointed and unimpressed, since this one is so highly regarded. Nothing wrong with it, but my expectations were very high. On the other hand, I might be approaching this style wrongly.
"
1," 12 oz bottle, via Sephiroth.  Pours a clear black body under a fizzy one inch brown head that slowly faded leaving some heavy lacing.  The nose is very chocolaty and roasty with some light chalkiness and coffee.  The flavor is overly roasted to the point where its just too chalky and ashy with some light coffee and milk chocolate on the finish.  I dont get any oatmeal influence at all on either the flavor or body.  Mouthfeel is somewhat thin with a watery texture and moderate soft fizzy carbonation.  Quite a long lingering finish.  Overalll, this was just a ho-hum middle of the road Stout at best.
"
1," MAR 18, 2007 Pours a beautiful dark red with lots of head and lace. Nice fruity aroma.  Incredibly smooth and creamy in the mouth.  Taste is not incredibly complex but its still great.
"
1," Pours red brown with beige head.Aroma is of fruit and alcohol.Appearance is cloudy unfiltered.Flavor is of plums.Palate is tangy acidic with an electric aftertaste.Overall a good brew, a little too sour for my tastebuds,maybe an orange peel would help.It has a mild hops presence.
"
1," 1.5L magnum from 2000. Shared with company on new years eve 2004. Champagne like pop of the cork. Hazy chestnut color with a tan head. Musky, wood cork smell. Light to medium bodied. Nice carbonation. The taste mirrors the smell with the oak / cork flavor.This brew didnt age as well as Id expected. Still not bad, though
"
1," Cloudy ruby. Faint berry nose and taste, nearly vinegary. Good lace
"
1," Very, very nice beer.  The most easy flowing beer I have ever had.  Enjoyable aftertaste, yet not overly done.  Has to be one of my favorites.
"
1," Pours the color of the ice tea my mom used to brew.  About 12 tea bags per quart.  Nice off white head.  Nose is floral with yeast, malt, and some dark fruit.  Taste is incredible with the usual malty goodness in these types od ales.  A strong beer that hides the alcohol very well.  Worth stocking up on.  I have had the red which I thought was good but this is better.
"
1," Copper orange-brown, cloudy with fine particles. Puffy head, long lace. Yeasty, mildly fruity nose. Yeasty palate with hints of apple and sweet spice, pleasantly bitter finish. Very nice, but I think I prefer the white.
"
1," swing top bottle(500ml). -Cloudy golden coloured, small soapy white head that went away for two seconds, acidic butterscotch nose. Typical slovenian homebrew taste, malty, yeasty, honeyish hoppy with some dry herbal notes in the finish. Also quite watery. According to the label alcohol content is between 4 and 5%ABV.	Avaliable only in bottles even at Sokol Restaurant in Ljubljana.
"
1," bottle from stfun consumed at daks 1/19/11.		right on porter color with a small tan head.		it smells of oak, roast, ash, mellow bourbon, chocolate and caramel. after it warms a tart fruitiness shows up.		the tartness carries over in to the flavor... seems to be mildly infected but it works. there are also notes of ashy charcoal, chocolate, roast and a little bit of tannins on the finish.		tartness makes the medium body quite bright. carbonation is crisp. 7/3/7/3/14+
"
1," Bottle. Pours ruby with thin white head. Off-fruit malt nose. Badly rendered dry fruit flavour and a lingering unpleasantness. Pretty poor. Gets ye pished but.
"
1," Cloudy yellow colored beer with a thin head. Aroma is of clove and coriander with notes of citrus and maltl. Overwhelming  orange and coriander flavour. Too sweet and watery for a wheatbeer
"
1," An OK pale ale. In the bottle, this one is dominated by wheat and grass, but on tap, it is much more hoppy and malty. Has a copper finish in both versions, which I didnt care for too much. I liked the different hop profile in the tap version. A good session local.
"
1, Seven Sisters WildHorse Pear Hard Cider	Date
1," Read about this beer in an in flight magazine, Southwest I think, so I was curious to try it.  Nice light aroma and flavor. A little lighter and thinner than I expected, yet a very nice overall experience.
"
1," 2001 750ml bottle.  This beer really took me by surprise.  I was expecting a good beer, but this was great.  It lacked the extreme sweetness that many Belgians have.  It was very well rounded and balanced.  The flavor profile was quite complex, yet subdued, making it quite easy to drink.  Very enjoyable!
"
1," Light brown with a fluffy tan head. Spicy, flowery hop aroma with some roasted malts. Tastes of sweet roasted malts, chocolate and nuts. Great mild bitter chocolate finish. Not overpowering, but very flavorful.The best that Disney had to offer.
"
1," Not so attractive - head dissipates a little too quickly and doesnt really lace. Though the color is pretty nice, dark brown with ruby red tones. Smells great though, mmm, florals and sweetness, smells quite sweet, but boozy and with a hint of nutty raisiny-ness. Quite carbonated.Tastes slightly sweeter than expected, but great balance of flavors, and tastes increasingly delicious/flavorful with warmth. And of course, the booze at the end.		Mm, i love me some belgian strong.
"
1," Courtsey of Tony @ OTH.	Pours brown/amber, with brownish head.	Aroma, filled with dark fruits and sugar.	Taste, dark druits (cherry / prune) and malty. Los of sugar / licorice sweetness.	Excellent balance, close to a Westie12, a little darker in content and texture.	This is a big beer, very drinkable, a good sipper, gets better as it warms up.
"
1," This beer has always had a touch of a metallicness to me and this past time was no different... Very complex, very fruity, very yeasty, big bold flavor, changing ever so slightlly as it warms... There is a reason this is the most well known belgian strong ale in the US... Metal taste...
"
1," bottle, bought at the brewerys Getrnkemarkt in Ergenzingen. Cloudy pale brown colour, large woff-white head. Malty, hints of caramel and wheat, slightly yeasty. A bit thin, though.
"
1," JAN 14, 2003 330ml bottle, cellared since 7/16/02.  Aroma of rum-soaked spice cake, raisin, estery yeast,    and dark bread.   Dark, opaque brownish red in color with ample carbonation and head.  Profoundly sweet and fruity, with a variety of dessert and baking spices, raisin and lightly warming alcohol.  Aftertaste is long, spicy, having a scant amount of hop flavor and continuing maltiness.  Really really good.  My first ever true Belgian Ale experience years ago.
"
1," Pours a nice amber with a white head. Very aromatic and tastes of fruity spices. Its bitterness is not too heavy, but not completely absent.
"
1," A 0.33L bottle from Alko shop. Pale fast disappearing head. Hazy pale brown colour. Slightly sour not sweet malty taste. Also some hints of licorice. Some hoppiness at the end. Some medicine likeness.
"
1," On tap at the brewery in Nashville. Deep red/amber color. Crystal malt and citrus hop aroma. Taste is hoppier; more bitter than flavorful or aromatic. Interesting for an amber beer, but definitely not my favorite.
"
1," Very good barrel aged porter!  I have to admit I had no idea who they were when I bought it.  Aroma is very woody with vanilla being the dominate flavor followed by mild amounts of chocolate and carmel.  Appearance is dark brown, opaque with a frothy tan head.  Flavor is malty sweet.  Bourbon comes up heavy on the finish.  Well done.
"
1," 11.2 oz. Bottle.   Tasted like every other Belgian beer with that sickening taste of yeast and bananas.  Do the Belgians only make beers with that taste?  I keep searching for an exception to the rule, but they ALL taste the same!
"
1," This is my first Armenian beer. Nice head formation and lacing down the glass.  The golden color was slightly hazy.   The beer was hoppy for s lager with a herbal finish. This is typical european tasting beer.  I felt like I was in France or Austria.
"
1," 3 oz Sampler at the brew pub. Light dry weak. As a light beer should be. Wheat barley with a crisp finish. Next time I will pass.
"
1," Shared with TJ. Nose is hops of earth and herbs. Malty and estery type Belgian tones. Nice Belgian fruity notes. taste is sweet and finishes bitter. nice fizzy carbed mouthfeel.
"
1," small bottle, poured a dark brown color with little head, fruity smell and flavor, alchohol on the finish, very strong brew, def something to have.
"
1," Springfield, PA location... Poured an opaque black color with a creamy tan head and nice lacing.  Strong vanilla and roasted malt aroma.  Creamy taste of coffee, chocolate and vanilla. The bartender told me this was an imperial stout at about 8%.  She didn't convince me, there was no alcohol to be found, and it was sweet as hell!  But still good.
"
1," Draught at Siboire. Small brown foam. Coca cola color. The aroma have both cherries and black currants. Good maltyness and some sweetness.
"
1," 2007 Bottle. Pours red-brown with chunks of yeast. Small aroma of fresh and dried fruits, dates, figs, ananas, strawberries. Very soft and creamy. Thin body with big frothy carbonation. Quite dry, but still with a sweet taste due to low hopping. Slightly bitter finish from the yeast and rosted malt. Phenolic, soft and fruity. Dates and rye spicyness. Alcoholic.
"
1," On tap at the brewpub, Ingnieuse 17.0 Nice copper/red pour with a thin white head. Aroma of leafy hops, some citrus and caramel. Taste is mild, nice balance of sweet caramel maltiness, love the 50/50 hopping of cascade and golding together, nice balance of english and american hopping. Nothing to write home to mother about, but a decent session beer.
"
1," Pours dark, like a black tea; very thick beige head.  Aroma of dark malt and definetley detect the floral notes; very little hop bouquet.  Very warm, malt heavy flavor, with a mild alcohol bite; no detectable hop bittenerss or flavor.  Very full body which lasts well into the finish.
"
1," Atlanta.  On tap at Rock Bottom Restaurant and Brewery in Buckhead.	Wow!  What a great ale!  One of the best American brown ales that Ive ever had.  It is quite complex, with sweetness and nuttiness.  A wonderfully dark complexion makes you want to try this one; and, trust me, you wont be disappointed in the least.  A good, good beer.
"
1," Bottled.  Clear golden,minimal head. Grassy buttery nose with mstard seeds and alcohol coming through. Sweet and well rounded, peppery alcohol, but fairly low bitterness. Pleasant bock.
"
1," Pours brown colour with a tint of red, the head doesnt last long. The aroma is malty, with caramel and estere from the yeast. The flavor is full of caramel and yeast, but also a bit of dark fruit. The aftertaste is a bit bitter, which makes a good balance
"
1," Drank it on tap at Masons in Sacramento.  Pours golden and hazy with nice carbonation.  Light/medium bodied, very well balanced between malts and hops.  However, it is spicy at the end.  One of the best finishes Ive had so far.

1," I cannot appologize for the high ranking.  This is truly the best beer Ive ever had.  I would rate the Premiere a bit higher, if possible. Great with a cigar and cheese or nuts.  I am in heaven when drinking this beer.
"
1," I liked this Chimay the least of the other two I have had. I would buy again but probably not anytime soon.
"
1," Murky brown colour with a large off white head. Very sweet malty and fruity aroma. Flavor is sweet and malty with hints of caramel and fruit.
"
1," Bottle shared with HogTownHarry, tupalev & biegaman -- my bottle courtesy of lewis13. Pours black with ruby hues and a large mostly-lasting light-brown head. Aromas a tad sour and lactic along with lightly roasted malt and some chocolate. Flavours roasty with some chocolate and hints of coffee and hops. Medium bodied. Not sure this should be qualified as a ""Sweet Stout"", its too ""burnt"", but its a pretty good Stout nonetheless.
"
1," (Bottle) Yahoo! An Armenian beer - Thank you Mahars. Pours a copper colour. Nose of red wine and caramel. Terribly sweet and caramel-like. Above average.
"
1," Excellent brew.  Great taste and ability to get you nice and tipsy very quickly.
"
1," Pint on tap at Seven Bridges Brewpub, Jacksonville.   Red-amber beer with a nice creamy head.   Flavor is intense caramel malts and cascade hops.  A decent, drinkable brewpub ale, but nothing really remarkable.  Good enough to drink more than one.
"
1," 11.2 oz bottle.  Dense chocolate brown with a fingers worth of smooth bone head.  Barely laced.  Yeast; raisins and currants wafting in.  Begins with Madeira alcohol; other flavors develop later.  Medium, creamy with some carb tingle that melts away leaving molasses, tobacco and mocha.
"
1," Bottled. An unclear dark golden with a thin off-white head. The aroma has strong notes of wheat as well as some caramel and bread. The flavor is sweet with strong notes of wheat as well as notes of malt, bread, and some banana, leading to a dry wheaty finish. Thanks Papsoe for sharing and Timo for bringing it to Denmark.
"
1," yeasty with a pronounced banana flavor with other fruit notes.  a good brew.  i must try more by chimay
"
1," Warm brown color with some hazyness and fluffy beige foam. Sexy aromas of dried fruit like figs and plums, but also aromas of cookies. Tha taste is intens and well ballanced.
"
1," Bottle. Blonde. Soft flowery aroma. Flowery, somewhat perfumed flavor. Malty with a touch of hops. Typical German helles, well made and fairly tasty.
"
1," Thanks to atpayne for this one.  Pours blacker than Yaphet Kotto, with the biggest, brownest head Ive ever seen outside of interracial porn, and more lace than a rich girls wedding veil.  This one is bottle conditioned, and has a huge aroma of malt, bourbon, and chocolate.  Tastes very malty, with huge coffee, bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, and black licorice presence.  Finishes nice and smooth, with a final blast of malt, oatmealy sweetness, bourbon, and some hops at the finish.  Very complex, great mouthfeel.  A great oatmeal stout.
"
1," This one is my favorite of the three. Showing some fruitiness in the aroma and some spiciness in the taste it is very well balanced and easily enjoyed.
"
1," A faint nose of yeast and pear. Taste is of chocolate, anis and spices, I remembered this as better. Lots of bottles in the cellar, though, so I will rerate within the near future.
"
1," Dark amber color out of the bottle with a fizzy beige head that left quickly.  Thin, watery sweet nose.  Not a lot of character in here, but nothing really offensive.  Thin caramel sweetness, some roasted grains and faint chocolate.  Kind of boring.
"
1," Bland aroma and flavor, hops are weak and the malt is lightly toasty but barely present. Light beer means light body & lower alcohol, not less flavor, get it right.
"
1," A really complex flavor; something you have to sit and think about with every sip.
"
1, A full body nourishing IPA with intense resinous coniferous hopping.  Great brew.	How
1," MAR 27, 2006 Excellent, aggressive belgian beer. Super strong aroma with a nice lasting head. Flavor is a kick in the mouth, very flavorful.
"
1," Weve taken the Durango to Silverton train, and so I had high hopes for this IPA. The elements are poorly mixed - hops and malt fight each other rather than cooperate - and the malt, unfortunately, wins.
"
1," This was probably my first and still my most favorite dubbels on the market.  Very complex and yeasty much like westmalle.  I dont like such dubbels that are overly sweet and cloying.  THis one is a nice deep brown color with a great head and complex sweet and spicy flavors and aromas.  One of the best examples of an abbey dubbel.
"
1," On tap, served in the proper Chimay goblet.  An excellent Belgian, up there with the Bleu.  The yeasty smell is more subdued than the Bleu, but there is more fruit.  Quite refreshing.
"
1," Bottle at Quinns, 26th April 2008 with Mes, renffisch and reakt. Very dark brown with a  big fluffy white head. Wheaty, vanilla nose and a sweet caramel flavour with citrus sharpness to balance. Great weight, very drinkable. A good dunkelweizen.
"
1," 33cL bottle.  Deep copper pour with a short off-white head and lots of dark sediment suspended in there.  Dark fruits prevalent in the aroma (plums and apricots primarily), along with some Belgian yeast and peppery spices.  Flavor was definitely more impressive and intense... with the fruits deeper and more rich, the yeast imparting somewhat musty notes, and the spices were just well-balanced in there.  Very smooth on the palate, with the wonderful flavors cascading across the palate.  Sweet fruityness at the finish with some nice spices.  Beautiful beer.
"
1," On cask at Cloisters. Pours a golden colour with a thin white head. Musty aroma of yeast, sweet caramel, hay, grass and barley. Similar flavours, quite yeasty again, with caramel and barley also. Mild carbonation and an oily mouth-feel. Not for me.
"
1," Re-rating as I recently tried it	for the first time in quite awhile,	and my palate has developed a bit since then.	Also, I was quite mistaken in previously calling	it a spicier version of the Red...its a different	animal altogether.  It is spicy though, along with	plenty of malty sweetness, and some interesting smoky	and licoricey notes.  Aroma is sweet and malty.  Poured with	an amazing big rocky white head.  Strong enough for you	to really feel it.
"
1," I had a nighmare about this stuff. I wanted to have no mention of it ever again, but I needed to just vent. Pours clear dark brown and foamy. Nose is all bourbon, maybe some vanilla, oak. Taste is bourbon, astringent. No malts, watery and thin. Cola like carbonation. Drain pour. Cant take a mediocre beer and make it better in a barrel.
"
1," Bottle pours black as night, large foamy brown head, with super sticky lacing.  Heavy, sweet aroma of bourbon and vanilla.  Seems very similar to the Bourbon Barrel Porter aroma.  Flavor, to me at least, doesnt seem to be as robust as the porter tho.  Burnt malts, light bourbon, and slight vanilla notes on the tongue  Okay body, medium mouthfeel.  Finishes with some bourbon imparted oak flavor with hints of vanilla.  Doesnt seem heavy enough, albeit quite clean.  I believe I prefer the Porter to this one.  Thanks goes out to atpayne for the trade! 
"
1," JUN 12, 2003 This beer strikes my chord.  From the rich head (better than the White on this mark) and bruin color, to the balance of carbonation and flavors...gosh, what a beer.  The aroma is a bit softer than other top beers, and the flavor might be accused of not being the *most* complex, but this is wondrous beer in my book.  Re-rate (June 2003)"
1," (Bottle 50 cl) Courtesy of yespr. Slightly hazy golden with a small, rough white head. Malty aroma. Medium body, quite malty, a little sulphur and a dry finish. 180808

1," Draught@brewpub (Portland, OR,)	Pale amber color, small white head. Light nutty nose. Weak, watery palate. Light hoppyness, some citrus, but where are the flavors? Not very ESBish.
"
1," DEC 6, 2007 Bottle from sliffy. Very balck with small tan head. Massive coffe aroma. Tha smell ids the best part of this beer. The taste is mainly coffee with bitter finish. On the thinner side.
"
1," Pours a very deep dark brown. Almost black. Smells of belgian yeast. Strong alcohol aroma. Maybe a hint of clove. Full taste. Almost rum like. Pruney. Dates. Sweet, dark fruit taste. Toasty. Very very good. One of the best beers ive tasted in this style.
"
1," 0,33 l bottle. Pours dark reddish brown with a foamy beige head. Fruity aroma, with hints of banana and caramel. The beer melts in your mouth and then gives a lovely explosion of soft malt and fruit with a nice alcohol touch, well-balanced. Some caramel and yeast also come out in the finish and leaves a lovely taste in the palate
"
1," Bottled. Dark amber coloured. Uncelar. Unclear. Dense light brown head. Sweetness and cocoa in the nose. Flaovur is quite flowery. Has some sweetness and fruits. Light spiced. Is medium bodied. Is sweetish and light bitter in the end.
"
1," Jan 07 bottle, 3 months old. Two years rating beers and this is the first time Ive had this one. Rather dissappointing, this. Aroma is wet, vegetal, macaroni and cheese. Pours with a disturbingly fizzy head.  Taste is dry, nutty, but also alarmingly thin. Definitely better than the classless aroma, but its hard to be excited at all by this beer. I dont understand at all how this has been elevated to such a high level. While Chimays Tripel was outstanding, this is almost worthless IMO. Perhaps Ive just got a bad bottle.
"
1," Light and crisp golden lager.  Nothing of great note, but definitely worth a taste.  Highly sessionable and adequate to pair with spicy foods.
"
1," Foamy cream-colored head on a hazy reddish brown body.  Aroma was initially more hoppy than I expected, then with some time displayed sweet red fruits that became more and more apparent.  Fairly carbonated on the tounge and medium-bodied.  Smooth and a little yeasty.  Flavor is subdued, but good.  A very pleasant beer, but not very complex.
"
1," Hazy dark brown. Thick off-white head.  Big malty smell, with lots of dark fruit and spice.  Sweet malt flavor upfront with lots of spice. Dark fruit tastes like cherry and plum. The booze is there but its masked pretty well. Hops isnt too noticeable.  Medium bodied.
"
1," 33 cl bottle. Pours orangy brown with a thick, frothy, off-white head. Spicy and fruity aroma. Flavor is quite spicy, fruity notes with citrus like acidity, and slight bitternss towards the finish. Palate is light/medium, effervescent, with lingering spice, a hint of sweetness, and light bitterness.
"
1," Another fantastic Belgian Trappist beer, with 9% of alcohol. Had it on a nice restaurant called Volle Gas in Brussels.
"
1," One of the smoothest beers I have ever had.  Sweet aroma, a slightly thin head, fruity, hoppy taste
"
1," APR 21, 2008 Bottle from Systembolaget. A hazy orange complextion with a thick rocky head. Fresh bready yeast aroma with a sprinkling of corriander. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel wth a dollop of orange marmalade and cloves.
"
1," Tasted on tap at brewpub. Pours a very light gold color. Small sized white foamy head. Aroma is wheat and slightly sweet. Light to medium bodied American wheat. Malts are wheaty, slightly fruity with some banana and clove flavors. It is a fairly standard brewpub standard American wheat. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is crisp and dry. Aftertaste is neutral.

"
1," a rich, dark color the taste was sweet and rich. the beer was  a little bitter with a nice head.this is a very good brew.
"
1," Bottle. Poured a dark reddish tone with medium rocky head. Aroma and flavor was complex and flavor of yeast and flowery tone. The finish was long medium biiter of alcohol.
"
1," On tap at Hamilton Place. This pours a deep, dark red with a just a small ring of head. The aroma is sort of roasty with hints at wax chocolate, grass, and nutshells. The mouthfeel is medium with a semi-tart flavor of wax chocolate, brownie crust, and nuttiness. This is a fair winter beer but not as suited for the season as their Iron Horse Stout. This is drinkable. For a bock, I liked it well enough as it lacked that weird fruity, gummy flavor I sometimes find in the style.
"
1," Cloudy, yeasty appearance with a tawny color. Very fruity aroma and flavor with a slightly oaky finish.
"
1," This beer is great.  A little strong (hence the genre).  Still, it is worth a try.
"
1," Bottle (341ml).  Shared with blankboy, his bottle.  Opaque, thick near-black with a small creamy/frothy brown head (4+).  Very bitter dark roast - coffee, semi-sweet chocolate, perhaps a hint of soy, also green hops and molasses ... and I detected a slightly off note, vaguely like plastic.  Excellent roast flavour, very bitter roast coffee beans, smooth and balanced, a hint of sour cherry tartness in the finish.  Silky, fairly thick mouthfeel, lightly astringent, moderately acidic, with a fairly quick finish.  Seemed more like an excellent coffee porter than a stout, but I quibbling - apart from that odd plastic note, this was really good.
"
1," Bottle from Ts in Tempe, AZ. Light amber color with a foamy beige head. Grassy/fruity hop aromas. Near medium body with frothy carbonation. Its not all that bitter, but it has the malt balanced by noble? hop. Finishes astringent. Another unique brew. Are not they all?
"
1," ( 500ml bottle thanks to blutt59) Pours clear brown with nice head and good lace. Nose of dark fruits. Tastes like milk chocolate, raisins with a watery body. Very drinkable.

1," APR 13, 2011 330ml Bottle. Pours a deep red/orange/brown with a foamy white head. Aroma of spices, dark fruits, toffee, caramel. Flavour of roasted malts, yeast, spices, dark fruits. Soft carbonation.		Suck on that F**k Society
"
1," one of my favorite belgians. pours rich brown with medium white head. aromas are roasted caramel malts, sugars, rich red fruits, leather. drinks with tons of light caramel malt and sweet sugar with a leather almost smokey note to it and nice banana and bread yeast. fantastic
"
1," 300 ml bottle. Pours a dark brown with a fizzy white head. Flavor is malty with a bit of alcohol (just a tad).  Very smooth on the palate for such a high alcohol content.  Excellent beer.
"
1," 12oz bottle-An incredible huge white head that takes forever to dissipate. An aroma of hops. Medium body with a taste of hops then a sharp bitterness from the middle to the end. Overall an ok Pale Ale
"
1," Not as good ad the blue, but still a good experience. I like the sweetness. Perhaps good as someones first trappist beer.
"
1," 12 oz. bottle, $9.50/6pack at Binnys. Popped when the Colts drew first score. Pours a big tan head over a brown body what shows light though as ruby highlights. Hell, as fine-looking a beer in this style as I know. Smell is mostly brown malts, a bit of Crystal, and this is a new enough bottle that I get some nice grassy fresh hops smell. Taste is lighter than the Newcastle minikeg Ive been draining; a bit more caramel with a hint of coffee. No distractions in this beer travels from my lips to my throat. Just a darn fine brown ale.
"
1," When asked for a recommendation at ""The Kulminato"" in Antwerp, this is what Dirks companion told as that you could never go wrong with. I drank a 2004 4 year old bottle last night. Perfect flavors of a rich, belgian ale with a smooth aftertaste. Perfect on the palate, without a strong alcohol taste for being 9%!
"
1," JUL 28, 2009 Floral aroma, rich and spicy, with some alcohol. Dark, murky, small head. Complex, flowery flavor. This bottle has much more hidden alcohol than my last sample. Nice.
"
1," Sweet aroma, with hints of banana and clove ... cloudy, dark amber in appearance with slowly diminishing head ... flavor has a hoppy/bitter start with a with a sudden drop into a malty finish. Overall, not the best that Chimay has to offer, but by the same token, it isn't Hamms either.
"
1," Bottle with dinner.  Pours dark amber, with medium head, aroma is fruit and malts.  Favor fruit, yeasty malt with some spice.
"
1," A brown ale with golden edging wears a soapy off white head.  This rises high but falls quickly, leaving not much lacing; but a swirl reinvigorates about a fingers worth.  The nose is of candied sugar and a dominant yeast character that brings to mind ginger snaps and freshly baked bread.  There is alcohol up front, but this gives way to the hops.  In the mouth its drier than I expected, and drier than most quads; though it shares those essential qualities of spices, malts and honey.  The hops seem fresh on this.  The body is medium with a high level of carbonation.  Again the yeast is strong and leads on into the finish where the beer grows a certain tartness.  Im not amazed by this.
"
1," Once again the Platz delivers! Had an hour to kill so I stopped by- Glad I did. This is a definate off the beaten path brew. A helles(german for clear) Not many styles like this one but rest assured it is grand! Pours a nice creamy white head with excellent release of aroma, fruity citrus notes- perfect carbonation, just enough to release the aroma- not soapy- first a slight hop bite then an overature of malty sweetness.	With a finish that is to be reckoned wth.	These go down oh so easliy- perfect compliment to the pretzels ordered with the brew, a salty sweet affair. Not had one helluva helles like this since Austria many years back. A perfect rendition of  the Bavarian style. A must have again!!!!	The Alt Platz , Das Gte Platz!!!!!!!
"
1," bottle. this stuff is very unique to me. strong flavor and its kind of like wine. light malty flavor and yeasty. very muddy clarity and very bottle conditioned. your not going to drink a lot of these at one time and I think thats the idea.
"
1," alcohol,dates and raisons. Nice dark brown amber with a litle head. Wonderfu raison, chocolate, plum flavor. Great, long lasting, aftertaste. Wonderful blanced
"
1," FEB 3, 2005 chimay is a classic to me.very good belgian strong for sure.this was the beer that intrduced me to the beglian style.murky ruby red in color.sweet aroma and a nice even white head.excellent taste overall.very well balanced for a belgian.for the pirce and availability,you cant really beat it.
"
1," Nashville.  Transparent pale yellow in color with a retracting yellow-tinted film that cakes the edges.  Clean linen sheets and a starchy sting kick out the light aromatic lager rhythms.  Herbal baguette flavor at its best, but its fairly retched.  Wishy washy, yeasty lemons, and an overall light load.  Seems all too common with a Miller Lite, but only unpasteurized and sweetened with a touch of lemon juice in this rendition.  Corn flakes come out with a well-water finish to deliver on the ol formula of what-you-se-is-what-you-get.
"
1," Appearance is a dark brown with a tan head that dissipates quickly. Minimal lacing. Aroma is of malts,candied fruits, and raisins. Taste is complex enough with malts and candied fruits up front, and raisins in the finish. Somewhat of a yeasty aftertaste that was a surprise but pleasant nonetheless. When I worked my way to the bottom of the glass, I found what appeared to be dark sediment swirling about. I went ahead and finished it off without any notice I had even done so. The sediment was so fine that it made no impact on my mouth whatsoever.
"
1," This brew poured a very small head of off-white bubbles that left a good lacing and a transparent uncarbonated light brown colored body behind.  It has a mild malt aroma.  Its mouthfeel is initially thin and watery but finished with a mild buitter aftertaste,  Its flavor was thin with notes of malt, hops and a few spices.
"
1," 330ml bottle from Alko		Pours copperish red with a large foamy head. Aroma has hints of yeast and spices. Taste is malty and has hints of caramel. Slightly sweet and sour finish. Not very complex, but well balanced.
"
1," Amber hued cloudy straw body.  Fresh citrus nose with lots of clean grass.  Bready malt backbone with light toasted sweetness.  Strong, floral hops with uniquely tart and sweet citrus character.  Not much bitterness.  Really nice drink.
"
1," Bottle. No head. Color is golden. Aroma and taste are rich sweet apples, syrop, alcohol and citrus notes. Great experience for first taste of an ice cider.
"
1," Draught at Rock Bottom - Atlanta.  Aroma is intensely roasted malt and some coffee but a nice background of herbal hops.  Pours a deep opaque blackish-mahogany with 1-2 fingers worth of thick creamy crown, good retention and fingery lacing.  Flavour is full of roasted and cholocate tones, slight coffee, and a nice prominent hop bitterness.  Finish is extremely smooth leaving a great roasty aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is creamy with the perfect amount of moderate carbonation.  Overall a wonderful stout, although nothing too characteristic - too bad this is only at the restaurant.
"
1," ""Opvallend anders"" is written on the label, and the smell is really something else. Moderate malty, very flowery, liquor. Small white fizzy head, fast disappearing, golden clear body. Light bitter and later on light sweet taste, average duration. Light to medium body, dry and creamy texture, soft carbonation. A rather strange smelling beer, hard to define
"
1," Very fruity. But also very good. Another good one from Chimay. Not quite as good as the Bleu, but good nonetheless.
"
1," Unclear orange with huge beige lasting head. Sweet yeasty aroma with coriander and toasted malt. Sweet yeasty flavour with toasted malt, caramel and koriander.
"
1," I had my doubts. In the back of my bald head i refused an once of credit to chimay...until i downed a pint of this!		Pure heaven my sons......
"
1," Bottle 50cl.Unclear light to medium yellow color with a average to large, frothy to creamy, good lacing, mostly lasting, off-white to white head. Aroma is light to moderate malty, wheat, light to moderate yeasty, banana notes. Flavor is moderate sweet and light light bitter with a average duration. Body is medium to light, texture is watery to oily, carbonation is soft. [20090625]
"
1," (2006 33 cl bottling) Beautiful colour, nicely spiced Belgian strong ale.  Looking forward to enjoying the 2004 75 cl bottle I have in my cellar in a few years...
"
1," This place had no beer list so I going on what my server recited to me as their offerings on the day. I can only assume this is their swamp fox IPA. Pretty light on the hops here and if I were classifying this thing it would be a straight APA. Maybe my view was skewed by the infection though too. Diacetyl all the way sucking the life out of this drink. The only other thing I got here was a light grain aroma, wheat, bread.
"
1," OCT 24, 2011 Bottle @ home. Poured into a Chimay glass with quite lively carbonation. Cloudy dark appearance with a highly carbonated, tan head. Toasty dark malty, chocolate, Belgian yeasty, light toffee aroma. Soft bubbly mouth feel. Caramel, dark chocolate, Belgian yeast, dessert-like flavor with a light earthiness. Booze is hidden very well. Very nice beer though not as good as a Westy or a Rochefort.
"
1," This hasnt been around in a while. Actually, this bottle was from around 2005 I believe. A nice cellar find that I popped a couple of months ago and took notes for. The aroma of this was solid, nothing had faded in the bottle and the chocolate and roast took center stage. The bourbon had all cooled off in the flavor, letting the oak and vanilla come through. Flavor was solid, just not enough of it, texture and mouthfeel were both watery. Amped up, this could be a great one.
"
1," poured iced tea brown with a small tan head. Sweet malt aroma. Sweet malt and light fruit in the flavor. Fairly thin body. Clean tasting and seemingly well made. Mild candyish flavor in the finish. Good.
"
1," Bottle 330ml. Color dark red with medium head. Aroma dark fruit, sugar. Taste sugar, sweet caramel, alcohol, honey.
"
1," SEP 17, 2004 Just cracked a bottle with ""3/99"" on cork. I beleive that Chimay is good, but Trappist Ales are not my bag. The nose was great, but the overall feel was a little too fruity, ""chewy"", if you know what I mean. Even though it is not my favorite kind of beer, this is my favorite of all the Trappist ales.
"
1," Quickly becoming a frequent style for me... Another Abbey Dubbel... Dark brown body with fairly thick, slowly dissipating tan head.  Smells malty and slightly sweet.  Tasty, but not as overwealming as some Dubbels.  Fairly well-balanced.  Definitely can taste the hops and fruit influences.  A decent beer, definitely can see me drinking this again.
"
1," This is probably my favorite of the Chimay beers.  Its just so good and so smooth.  Great with a meal, a perfect example of the dubbel style.
"
1," MAY 21, 2005 Brown and ruby colour with some haze. Big creamy head. Sweet aroma of honey with some pepper and alcohol. Tatse"
1," pours a deep orange with a beautiful white head with a wonderful white  lacing.  Aromas of that belgian yeast that we have come to lovem but its not that strong.  Flavors are bitter yet sweet with doughy and citrusy flavor... this may be my favorite of all the chimays ue to that balance and flavor.
"
1," SEP 26, 2011 33ml, wine glass. Audibly fizzy. 	Cloudy, copper brown. Beige head diminishing to thin, patchy.  Small bubbles.	Sweet, fruity smell, not unlike a wine.	Sweet malts, spicy aftertaste, light bitterness with time.	Palate thin, overcarbonated.	Overall not much depth and carbonation reduces pleasantness.
"
1," This smacked of quality. It was really a flavorful, complex brew that had weight and substance to it. I liked it, and probably preferred it to other Chimay products Id had.
"
1," Cask Handpump at the Crown Inn, Stockport 08/11/2008	Hoppy aroma. Clear golden coloured and hoppy with a crisp and very dry malt finish.
"
1," A great Trappist Ale.  Very good.
"
1," DEC 31, 2008 Bottled. Hazy brown colour with huge bubbly beige head. Sweet alcoholic citric aroma with some malty notes. Barley, malt and lots of yeast in the flavour. Also some banana and caramellish hints. Pleasant palate, but a bit much carbonation.
"
1," 750ml bottle.	Dark brown pour with a good amount of head.  Aromas of dark fruit, candi sugar, and Belgian yeast.  Flavor is as good as the aroma with just the right amount of sweetness.  Very silky and insanely easy to drink at 9%.  Top notch brew.
"
1," 07-07.  I have had this beer a few times, and have enjoyed each time.  Very complex malt flavor hides the high alcohol content.
"
1," 3-5 month old bottle from Shigadeyo, drunk on 11/2/07Black body, with a medium-high clarity and a large, light-tan head showing moderate retention and light lacing.Typical coffee stout aroma, and fortunately, its very aromatic.  Vanilla, fresh beans, dry chocolate notes and tastefully light amounts of caramel collect at the edge of the nose.  Light hop bitterness invigorates the senses and pushes the coffee and malt flavors through to the finish.  Some crispy popcorn-like notes nearly remind of diacetyl, but I dont think there is any here.  Quite dry and with that papery, beany note that is inevitable in coffee stouts.  Hop resins persist on the end, but the smooth choco-vanilla malts do not peter out.  No alcohol noted, medium-high to high strength of aroma.Very soft, but high levels of carbonation lend a creamy-fluffy feel to the body, as light chocolate fudge braces the palate for a big dose of roasty coffee and strong vanilla flavors.  It slowly dries the palate, with help from hop bitterness and slightly astringent black malts.  Caramel sweetness perks up as it warms and breathes, and light looseness in the body is exposed as well.  No alcohol noted and quite drinkable.  Perhaps a little less caramel sweetness and more interplay between vinousness and coffee would help.  I dont see the need for this much pine and citrus bitterness either.
"
1," The most assertive IPA at Hagars, and thus the most assertive IPA in Canada.  Like eating a handful of hops.
"
1," Bottle 50cl.Clear light to medium yellow orange color with a average, frothy, fair lacing, mostly diminishing, white head. Aroma is moderate malty, hell bock alike araoma, sugar, light alcohol. Flavor is moderate sweet and light to moderate acrid bitter with a average duration. Body is medium to light, texture is oily to watery, carbonation is soft. [20081129]
"
1," WOOHOO, #50!.....	It's been a while since I've had one of these, unfortunately. This pours with a large, rocky head, with really not much of an aroma, maybe slightly yeasty with plum/date hints; very nice oaky, slightly fruity carmel flavor with notes of raisins and dates and subdued alcoholic-ness for such a strong beer; slighty dry aftertaste, great balance in general. This is sooo much better than the red, IMHO, but a different brew, no doubt; very nice!
"
1," Bollte. White head. Dark red brown body. Fruity malt aroma. Spicy complex flavor.
"
1," Poured into trappist glass.  Pours ruby-brown with two fingers of beige head.  Heavy odor of raisins and caramel.  subtle yet sweet taste that ends with the warmth from the alcohol.  A nice, complex beer.
"
1," MAR 8, 2007 I just had to rerate it. Lately it has become a beer thats above average but certainly not one of the best anymore. Just try drinking 2 good beers (4.0 and above) and a Chimay Blue in 1 row. I did and Chimay Blue sudenly doesnt seem that great anymore. Butterscotch and apple aroma. More like a Doppelbock than a BSA. Light hazy, ruby color, beige head, fair lace. Sweet, hints of vanilla, some licorice, laurel, soft bitterness. Sparkling but a waming finish.
"
1," Yummy Ale.  750ml bottle.  My first Chimay ever, so this is the one that made me fall for Trappist Ales.
"
1," (Draught) Pours a medium, foamy white head with a amber body. Nose of mild English malts and a touch of honey sweetner. The flavour lines-up similarly with the additional Czech Pils hoppiness and bitter finish. Somewhat average at best.
"
1," Aroma is rich and fruity, mainly malty with strong apple or pear component and a hint of spice. It pours a dark, brownish amber that is somewhat cloudy and has a thick but not too persistent head. Flavor is rich and satisfying, mostly malty, strong fruity hint, and a touch of cinnamon or clove. Smooth and lip-smacking, it has a bit of an alcohol bite in the aftertaste. Strongly recommended.
"
1," p flaske fra vinmonopolet vel - den sterkeste i serien - men allikevell rund og god
"
1," Bottle. Hazy brown color, Sweet and spice fruity aroma and taste. Maybe its because I get a lot of 3.2 beer here in OK, but I could really taste the alcohol in this. This is a good beer, but it is pretty expensive.
"
1, Seven Sisters WildHorse Apple Hard Cider	Date
1," Bomber from BBB63; Nose of rye and vanilla; Dark brown with a medium beige head; flavor of bourbon, caramel, and peppery spiciness. I love the flavors but not quite enough complexity for a bigger rating!
"
1," Bottle at decaturstevos Februmergency  Tasting for those of us that missed out on Sexual Chocolate 09 thanks to decaturstevo.   Semi-clear amber pour with thin white head.  Nose is light hop with an oatmeal quality that is nicely balanced.  Flavor tends toward the hops with some bittering.  Enjoyable enough i suppose.
"
1," Draft at brewpub.  Dark brown color with an off white head.  Pleasant aroma of chocolate, vanilla oak and a slight trace of bourbon.  Dark chocolate and smokey flavor with some vanilla cream also present.  I could hardly detect any bourbon in the taste.  Enjoyable porter I would definitely order again.
"
1," Pours brown with a big, foamy brown head and a vibrant look of carbonation. Nose is big, as advertised, with sugar, wheat bread, yeast, and caramel coming on strong. Flavor is layered with a slight wine quality to the expected strong brown malt, heavy abbey yeast, a little roastiness, some alcohol, and hops and coriander on the backside. Finish is a little oily but not badly so. This is definately a ""drink slowly"" ale and good stuff to wind down on.
"
1," Fantastic ice-cream head, body segues from rusty red to coppered orange, very fresh yeasty, smacks of ground allspice in the aftertaste. a sweet stab earlier on. Its all the long, satisfying finish.
"
1," Bottled@Bjrntasting. Hazy yellowish golden colour, small white head. Aroma is mild spices, some acidic fruits, wheat as well as some mild rotten bananaish notes. Flavour is wheat, fruits, some mild spices as well as yeast.
"
1," Pours brown with light tan head. Aromas of dough, bread and brown sugar. Flavors are sweet and fruity, with yeast and some dark malts. Medium to full body with tingly carbonationand a slick mouthfeel. Very nice.
"
1," Surprising bit of malt flavor. The color is extremely pale, but the head has a great bit of fullness and retention which saves the appearance score. No hops as expected, Slightly citric nose. For a light lager, this is good.
"
1," Dutch ratebeer meeting. Clear light-yellow coloured. Typical rice pils, although it is not made of rice. At least now i've drunk an Armenian lager, for what it's worth.
"
1," APR 7, 2003 Soft and full of flavour. Typical Chimay brew. Nice!
"
1," GCBF, Nice pour, light tan with big big co2 bubbles, and a slight head. Big aroma with plenty of honeyed overtones. Tastes a bit phenolic, with a moderate hop profile. A bit sweet for my taste, with a dry dry finish, and zero aftertaste to my palate. Drinkable, if unspectacular.
"
1," Draught(atlanta).  This is crap beer.  Very pale, small head, weak aroma, little flavor, weak finish.  Why do chain brew-pubs insist on having a beer like this?
"
1," I love this beer! I like the Whole CHimay line, as a matter of fact. A great fruity/spicy taste. A good beer anytime you are in the mood. A great dinner beer or desert! I like the tripple a little better.
"
1," This brew is a rich copper color with a thin off-white head. Fair lacing. Big malt aroma promises this to be a flavorful beer. Medium-bodied, with a sweet caramel malt flavor that is not as pronounced as expected. The beer seems to be relatively low ABV, and the finish lacks the punch I was hoping for. This brew has potential, but I think they need to toss a few more shillings into the pot.
"
1," FEB 12, 2011 From a 330ml bottle on 4/12/2010. Has a moderate aroma of stewed fruit and fruitcake. Flavour wise, there is lots of sweet fruit (raisins and plum), with some caramel and toffee. The carbonation is quite high, with a swirl of the glass sufficient to revive the head. Certainly a very nice drop, though I clearly not as keen on this as many ratebeerians.
"
1," I drank this beer from a large bottle 75 cl. (Grande Reserve). I think I should have stored it for some years. Its very hopbitter and pretty much like a port wine. -its a bit too strong and the beer doesnt manage to support the high level of alcohol. (my mistake...)
"
1," AUG 5, 2003 Monstrous foamy Chimay head that diminished well but left behind a thick cottony lacing. Sweet floral and yeasty fragrance. Also aromas of stone fruit, bubble gum, and cotton candy. Flavors of citrus and candy-sugar. Alcohol is noticeable. Lively champagne-like mouthfeel but medium-bodied and silky smooth. Very nice.
"
1," Draft at GABF. I was very excited when I saw this one, just because you dont see many pre-pro lagers out there. Pours a gold with stiff white head. Nose is vegetal, cabbage and maize. Some faint herbal hop notes come through, but the DMS is a bit offputting. On tasting, its a bit cleaner, but still vegetal with maize being a driving component. Bitterness works but the hops that they are proud of seems really restrained. I dunno, maybe a bad batch?
"
1," Brown, somewhat unclear, hazy, large head. Be careful with the yeast in the bottom of the bottle, even though some of it should be included. It actually makes it better, less sweet taste. A bit sweet aroma, smells like Belgian beer. Sweet bitterness. I am generally not a great fan of Belgian beer, but this was actually not bad at all.
"
1," Perversely good beer. I give the Catholic Monks multiple thumbs up for a most eloquent brew.  Worth a trip to the Old Scourmont Abbey!
"
1," Aroma of figs, cherries, and slight wafts of alcohol.  Pours deep brown with a big flume of a head.  Tastes of dark fruits, slight cloves and sweet caramel.  Well balanced and delicious.
"
1," Greenish-golden coloured, small white foamy layer, quickly vanishing; faint grainy hoppy and a bit sweet-malty nose with traces of cardboard; moderate to distinctive bitter-sweet flavour, light bodied to watery. Short bitter-sweet finish with the faintest illusions of a malty base. Even though the bohemian border can be reached from Waldsassen easily by bike, this brew is very far away from a Bohemian Pilsener....
"
1," Bottle.  Milky wheat malt aroma with hints of peach and orange.  Hazy orange yellow with a small head.  Slightly sweet orange-pineapple juice and light malt.  Light summer beer - nothing great and a bit on the sweet side.
"
1," AUG 16, 2003 A good beer especially for something found at a minor league baseball game. Appearance is orangish. Aroma is malty and fruity. Flavor has a nice malt kick with a slightly fruity taste, maybe apricots and oranges, and some hop presence. Mouthfeel is quite nice, creamy and smooth, with a nice bite. Much better than I expected.
"
1," Fruity aroma, great head, vinous aromas. Smooth for the % alcohol, some spice on the finish.  Kind of port-like, I would love to try a 20 year old Blue!
"
1," I didnt think that this was anything particularly special.  The flavors were somewhat indecipherable to me other than carmelized sugar, intense carbonation and high levels of acidity.  It did have excellent color and I love it when I can see little remnants of ingrediants circling the glass. Very creamy as it warms up. Dont get me wrong, I dont think it was bad, but nothing that Id see out to drink again.
"
1," Not as strong tasting as the bleu but Stronger than the cinq cents. By far, when it comes to flavor this is teh best tasting of the Chimays.
"
1," Yes ... this is good.  Rose flavours and a smoothness belying its alcohol content.  My favourite Belgian beer to date.  Much better than the Red.
"
1," very much pitch black, nice tan head that dissapears quick, nose is coffee, and some vanilla. Flavor is semi sweet bakers choc, some hops and caremel, maybe a little burnt flavor too, decent beer
"
1," Dark caramel orange, whitish cover.  Aroma is citrus, orange, grapefruit, and some caraml malt.  Taste is grapefruit, caramel, light grassy spiciness mixed with a moderate bitter finish.  Nice stuff.
"
1," Bottle. Pours jet black with a small brown head. Aroma of roasted malts, coffee, vanilla, chocolate and faint bourbon. Flavor was medium bodied and creamy with bitter chocolate, roasted coffee, vanilla, oak, roasted malts and bourbon.
"
1," Awesome beer. had it with dinner tonight and i loved every second of it.  It was sweet in aroma and taste.  The was nice lastiung head and nice lacing.  Yeasty and smooth, a great beer.
"
1," Au Naturale. 		Loving it, but I think it was better when it was not mass  produced years back. I question quality recently.		Chimay, beautiful. 		I give Microbrews current edge even over Chimay. Just prefer  taste of  the home made flavor of Microbrews even over some European excellence.
"
1," 11.2 ounce bottle-  poured out a cloudy translucent gold with a giant and long lasting ivory head.  Aroma was a little dusty, hops and citrus.  Taste was just about perfect.  Hoppy but mellow with a minor acidic bite, no bitterness at all.  Champagne like carbonation and a light palate.  Excellent, just excellent.
"
1," Really didnt like this beer. Been drinking a lot of Belgian beers recently and saw this one cheap in my local supermarket. Knew the name and had heard good things about it.. It looked great, but tasted terrible, far too much alcohol in the aroma and in the taste. As a belgian bruin this is the worst I have tasted.
"
1," Pours a amber color with a small tan head. Nose is delightful but not pungent, with spice, dark fruits, belgian sugar, clove, and yeast. Mouthfeel is crisp, refreshing. Initial tastte of clove, touch of banana, light fruits and bready malts. Finishing clean with mild hop balance. Good palate duration and head retention. Excellent brew.

1," 750ml. btl. i really like this beer. appearance is murky amber brown with a small head that diminishes into little white spots with carbonmation bubbling up  here and there. smells dusty and of dakr dried fruit, with a hint of tea. smells of hops too. the mouthfell is smooth, with a moderate release of gasses. taste like it smells, plus a good deal of malty pleasantness. taste is dry. cheers!
"
1," Dark gold in color.  Smells of fruit and light roasted malt.  Tastes similar to a Noel.  Very nice.
"
1," 330 ml bottle. Pours a dark brown, with a coffee-colored head. Raisiny aroma with some dark malts. Yeasty flavor, with some fruits notes and a bunch of malts and some alcohol notes. Heavy, oily mouthfeel, high carbonation. My least favorite Chimay beer.
"
1,"Orangey coloured,hazy, lively carbonation, big fluffy to creamy off-white head, quite stable; bisquits, yeast and a good dash of grassy, aromatic hops in the nose; quite soft MF, light to medium bodied, moderate bitter-sweet flavour; sweet malt in the bitter and worty finish. Good, pleasant Zwickel......

1," A nice coffee aroma with a good chocolate flavor to it. This was a good beer at 9 am in the morning. Not bad but a liittle thin in the body overall.
"
1," Bottle - May 2006		Pour an opaque, slightly hazy copper-brownish colour with a nice creamy beige head that leaves a beatifull lace. Aroma is yeasty, of dried fruits, sweet. Taste is dry, a bit thin, simple, easrthy, sugary, refreshing, but not quite I was looking in this brew
"
1," Bottle 330ml @ home	Pours cloudy orange with a off-white head. Aroma is funky with notes of malt, caramel, dried fruits and yeast. Taste is medium sweet and light bitter. Body is medium, texture is oily, carboantion is soft.
"
1," Bottle. Poured a nice dark orange-brown color. With a quick fading tan head however it did last enough to be a thin cover. Grape aroma. Tastes are of grapes, malt, slight yeast. Incredibly smooth for alcohol content of 9%. The thin tan head is making beautiful lacing around the outside of the glass while consuming. Very enjoyable, an excellent beer!
"
1," Subtle hop flavor and aroma with sweet, full mouthfeel.  Very complex with many interesting flavors (it seems to have some stout and even wine like flavors).
"
1," Wow, a very nice dubbel. Aroma is yeasty, bready, light pepper, and light apricots with even lighter banana. Poured a nice red/brown cloudy color with an off white head. The taste was bready, sweet, and malty with light bitterness on the end. The mouth feel was nice and creamy. An excellent trappist dubbel I would recommend to anyone.
"
1," very very heady, I didnt have the correct glass to pour it into and it was foaming all over the place. Definitely foams more than the the Chimay Blue. Very good taste, has a decent spice taste but much less than the Chimay Blue. The alcohol content is not as prevalent as the Blue. Would buy again.
"
1," A fine dark ale in the Trappist tradition.  A thick, full beer, rose-brown in color.  Almost syrupy, and so sweet I can only drink so much in a sitting.  Full of dark fruit, prominent caramel, and with a cloying milk-chocolately finish.  Extraordinary smooth;  perhaps the smoothest Ive ever had.
"
1,"Light malty nose,light maple syrup...	Appearance"
1," On tap. Pours medium brown with a small whitish head. Smells of a bit of alcohol, chocolate and bread. Quite complex tasting, with flavors of malts and sweetness. Pleasant after taste. Not my favorite Belgian, but it is very enjoyable.

1," snifter at cool river;    dark coppery color with a thin off white head. Aroma is dark fruit?  this to me is a subdued dubbel and I like that better than some that are tooo much of everything - sweet slight carbonation; good not worth the $ in my opinion

1," Bottle, 33cl, from Vinmonopolet, Oslo. Vintage 2009 (BB 2014). Dark golden hazy brown. Lively head that settles down quickly. Rich aroma of yeast, caramel, fruits. Slick mouthfeel with some fizziness. Sweet fruity flavour, vinous finish with almost no bitterness. Good stuff, but next time Il let it age a couple of years.

1," Pours a deep amber with a nice lively off white head.  Aroma of belgian yeast dominates with fruit and spice.  Taste is mostly the same with darker fruits coming through and a little bit of caramel.  More subdued then the blue, but still good.  The unique belgian yeast alone makes it worth it.

1," 1989 bottle courtesy of bierkoning vs. a fresh bottle.  Both pour a ruddy brown with a thin off white head.  The 89 head dies out instantly though.  89 has a big malty aroma, dark fruits mix with light signs of age like apple cider vinegar and light oxidation.  Strong alcohol and a flat feel.  The fresh bottle has the same maltiness and prunes, other dark fruit and caramel but hides the alcohol better.  Both were fantastic, the edge goes to the fresh bottle but at 20 years young the old bottle is still kicking.

Caramel and lots of molasses in the flavor with a toasted malt background and has an orange and crisp cola taste from the hops.	Moderate to full bodied, resinous, with a crisp soft carbonation throughout.	When I reviewed the White Chimay, at the moment, I thought that was their best product. Now that Ive done this review, at this moment, I think this is the best product they have.
"
1," APR 30, 2008 2006 bottle.  Pours a hazy, deep, dark ruby-brown color with a mostly fully head, beige, and fizzy, but still creamy; settles to an average constant layer leaving some tight lacing.  Very intriguing nose for a dark Belgain with some floral notes, even some herbal notes, some darker malt notes, even a little vinous;  other notes of dough, light banana, and raisin.  Tastes more like a trappist than the nose led on with very rich malt flavors and typical yeasty notes, Belgian chocolate, rich caramel, hints of chicory, brown sugar, prune, light banana, mild hints of the floral towards the end keeping the beer from becoming cloyingly rich.  Palate is just more than medium, but somewhat round, making it seem much fuller, and lively; I didnt like the palate at first becasue of the lighter body and amount of carbonation, but it grows on you.  I was trying to compare it to other trappist palates, and that would just decrease the character of the beer, this one is too different from the others to be categorized the same way.  Finishes fairly long and mostly sweet with brown sugar, prune, and doughy yeast and the dryness becoming more apparent as well as a nice warming effect.  A good amount of alcohol warmth from the 9% but that only accentuates the beer.  Not at all what I was expecting from a trappist, but I was pleasantly surprised after having a few sips.  Not overly complex for a top level trappist, but quite refreshing as compared to others.  This one is much more subtle with the flavors and has many notes that I wasnt expecting from a trappist.  The more I drink the more I like it.  Very well put together and the delicacy of beer makes for something incredibly memorable.

1," Bottle. Aroma of freshly roasted coffee and malt. The roasted malt takes a backseat to the coffee on this one. Pours rich black with a thin, creamy khaki head. Flavor of cold press and malt. Fairly one dimensional. On the palate, it was a tad thinner than I had expected based on the appearance of the pour. Medium bodied with a watery finish.
"
1," Aroma of sour apples, licorine and some vinegar. Appearance was ruined by a bad pour, but I have fortunately seen some good pours of this beer. Opaque, creamy head that dissipated over a few minutes time. Flavor had brown sugar, alcohol tinge, licorine, molasses and sour apples. Full bodied beer with a lively palate. A winner.

1," Bottle.  Lighter but still nice wheat and banana aroma.  Light yellow with small but lasting head.  Wheat malt flavor predominates - light banana and orange as well.  Pretty watery.  Compared to regular Weizens this doesnt compare very well but given that its a low-alcohol, lo-cal beer, its extremely good - would take this any day over any other light beer.

Impressive aroma of macadamia nuts, lemongrass, nutmeg, Christmas cake, marzipan, Christstollen, almonds, Stilton, pear, mushroom and dried apricot- extremely interesting and rather inviting; very hard to describe- definetely plenty of character. A lot of lemongrass and mushroom showing up in the taste. Malt accentuated. Some solvent sneaking in. Strange. Interesting malt profile. Biscuity. Low bitterness. Sweet. Medium to full bodied. Subtle carbonation. Raisin appearing on the swallow. Residual sugars in the finish which is reminiscent of raisin and lemongrass. Distinct with plenty of character. Thanks a lot Quack-Duck!

Poured a deep brown color with an averaged sized off white head (cask had a huge head). Ill stop on the cask version here as I found it to smell and taste like buttered popcorn. The regular had aromas of nuts, light chocolate, and roast. Taste of chocolate, nuts, very light roast and caramel.	 Tasted on 9/7/2006 and moved over as part of the John Harvard clean up.

1," [Bottle] Pours dark brown with a small beige head. Aroma is big on alcohol and malt, with a lot of floral qualities that remind me of a greenhouse. Taste is caramel, malt undertones, raisin, a bit of red grape and some floral notes. Medium-thin mouthfeel with a good length finish. Overall, well made, but wasnt quite as good as I had hoped that it would be.
"
1," JAN 20, 2010 Bottle. This beer looks and smells decadent. If rating on that beautiful mahogany pour or the smells of ripe, dark fruit, this would be perfect. Drank this at the bar and it was still a little cold from the fridge, which seemed to mask the slight plum, raisins, grape, and prune taste I was getting. Nice subtle alcohol warmth at the end. Need to drink this a little warmer.		Re-rate, 1/20/2010 - Bottle - Dropped aroma from 10 to a 6. Not sure what I was thinking before. Still a nice beer, but way too hot. Masks some luscious flavors lingering below. Have a bottle in the cellar thats a year old. Will probably take it out in a year to see if that heat has subsided.

Flavor has notes of toasted malt, caramel, apple, a little chocolate, white grapes, yeast and plum/raisin. Pleasantly sweet with an earthy hop character in the finish. I cant believe this is a 9% alcohol beer - so smooth and drinkable. Medium body with an airy, light texture and lively fine-beaded carbonation. Great head retention. Quite good.

1," Ruby-tinged brown, hazy but not fully opaque.  Nutty, caramel aroma, a little cellared, musty.  Well-rounded malt flavor, suggestions of English-style fruitiness.  Carbonation is reasonably tame, but it still tingles adventursomely at times. (on tap, Rock Bottom Atlanta)

1," Bottle (12oz).  Shared with tupalev, my bottle.  Hazy amber, average frothy off-white head.  Interesting aroma, initially sweet nutmeat or cocoa -then leafy, UK-style hops.  Taste - dont like it at all - sour dishwater is really all I can think of, vague hops, but not good enough to care much.  Average body, sour aftertaste - bleh.

1," Dark brown body with a sudsy light brown head.  Pleasant aroma of sweet malt, brown sugar, and just a touch of hops.  Smooth, but slightly thin palate.  Overall sweet flavor with brown sugar and caramel giving way towards the end for a decent spicy bite.  Not a bad brew.

1," Murky amber colour with a off-white head. Light sweet banana light alcoholic aroma and taste. Medium body and a dry light alcoholic finish.
"
1," Bottle.  Chocolate and coffee aroma with a little tang and a little more sweetness.  Nose is a bit strange, has a combination of fruitiness and honeysuckle to accompany the stout notes.  Espresso and possibly plum.  Pours opaque black with a dark brown creamy head.  Medium body is smooooth, lightly fruity and chocolatey, but the coffee notes have backed off.  Some almonds with a very faint metallic touch.  Nice and malty, and the aftertaste is bittersweet.  Touch of oats.  Still needs some heft and (at least this bottle) stronger coffee notes to earn the right to the name.  Leagues ahead of the Brass Knuckles I just had.
"
1," Aroma of cherry which clears the nostrils.  Copper appearance with a thick quickly disappearing head.  Flavours of cherry, fizz and apricot.  Lingering pleasant finish.  Nice as a novelty but wouldnt want to live on it.

1," Dark brown with firey-orange tinge. Smooth head that lasted well. Fruity aroma, mild alcoholic tingle. Well balanced and easily drinkable. A winner in my books.
"
1," Pours a cloudy, nutty, iced tea brown.  Tan, two finger frothy head diminishes to a tan film with pronounced center as carbonation comes up from the center in the Trappist glass.  A medium palate with a slightly oily texture with lively small carbonation.  Leaves a very full, even lacing that lingers for a moment before descending the walls of the glass.  Aroma is a slightly sweet spice with a nutty background  not terribly strong. Initial banana sweetness was a surprise, then goes into a profound choco-nut, autumn spices and clove linger to the finish.  Maybe cassis as well?  Has a very pleasant mild spicy bite to it. Barely a trace of bitterness to add balance.  A truly great beer.  Loved every second of it.
"
1," I think the red is my favorite Chimay.  It has the most earthy, yeasty character that I love in Chimays ales.  Dont get me wrong, I like them all.  And it does seem to be better in the large, corked bottle than the small capped one.  I have always read that it is better after being laid down for about three years, but I dont have the patience.  However, I plan to start a small beer cellar, so check my review in 2005...
"
1," Light stone fruit aroma, like ripe apricot or freestone peach. The color is ripe apricot flesh. The beige head flattened and ringed. Medium bodied; slightly coarse, nearly creamy, carbonation; somewhat chewy. The flavor is light stone fruit, red berries, a sour note, a very little caramel sweetness, fresh plum, an astringency calling wood to mind. The finish is quite dry, and there is a very small bitter aspect. Very nice. The mouth puckers and begs for more.
"
1," Its dark amber with a huge, creamy head. The aroma has notes of roasted malt, caramel, nut-chocolate, light syrup. The flavour is moderately sweet with notes of caramel, light chocolate, hints of licorice and nuts. The finish is dry with light notes of citrus. Its a nice dunkel.

1," SEP 9, 2005 From a 750ml bottle, into the Chimay goblet. The beer is brown, darker than youd expect. Sweety smell of fruits and dissimulated alcohol. The taste is yeasty,  sweet (toffee?) and malty, pretty complex and very enjoyable in mouth. You dont taste alcohol so much, you just enjoy the brew.   I gotta concur with the decline theory. The last bottle I had had an obvious corny smell and so-so licorice induced maltiness.
"
1," Pours a cloudy golden color with a creamy white head and some beautiful lacing in a trappist glass.  Great aromas of bread, hops and fruit.  Waited a bit for the head to settle before partaking, and the wait was worth it!  Fruit and yeast dominates. with some hops and an alcohol bite.  Finish is ever so slightly bitter.  Those Belgians have done it again!  Great beer!
"
1," Pour is orange with a white head.  Aroma is a very nice and deep pine hop with a malty backbone.  Flavor loses something.  Still there are decent amount of pine and citrus hops along with some caramel malts.  Still pretty decent as this has a decent hop kick to this one.
"
1," Bottle. A very slightly opaque gold with a bright white head. The aroma has some notes of wheat bread and almonds. There is not much else going on in the nose. The taste has some light notes of pears and tomato soup. Bland and boring, not as bad as many American Wheats, with a hint of lemon zest in the finish.

1," Meh, I have to stop taking my account so seriously.  I need to rate the beers I drink, not just the good ones.  Thats not to say that this is a bad beer, just very, very bland.  	A rich, ashy aroma with creamy vanilla.  	The taste is also a bit ashy, bitter, some thin grainy flavor, and thats about it.  	Finish is thin and bitter, mostly due to carbonation issues and bittering hops that add nothing besides some remnant of a stout-like finish.
"
1," This pours a deep brown colour with a red hue, off-white fluffy head that lasts long. Milk chocolatey, yeast aromas with a tad of flowers and oranges. Malty sweetness in the flavour, complemented by raisins and chocolate. Cant taste the roasted malt. A warming mouthfeel with a pleasant (not boozy) ""burn"", medium carbonation and restrained bitterness. Sounds crazy but for such a big beer it is almost thin (in the finish) and very drinkable. I need to try this beer cellared, by now I somehow dont feel it...
"
1," a ruby-plum-chocolate color with a robust dusty head.  Aroma is a heavenly mixture of fruitiness, malts and a little alcohol zing.  Flavor evolves throughout the drinking experience, but is always a rich malted sweet, both fruity and full on the tongue.  The feeling left behind in the mouth is as satisfying as everything else.  This beer is drinkable, hearty, explosive with flavor and warmth.  I always have a bottle around for when that moment happens that calls for an indulgence.  Superb.

"
1," Dark brown color, thin head with largish bubbles. The aroma is pleasant and light. Flavorwise I run into a problem, since beer containing certain spices such as this one does seem to clash with my taste buds. I am detecting a measure of what I belive is clove, not so much that it makes it undrinkable, which is the case with certain German Wheat style examples, but enough to spoil the party for this effort. Too bad for me, because otherwise it seemed to be very good. Have a bottle of the red to try, hope I don't run into the same issue.
"
1," Draft in Jacksonville. Nice toasted grain aroma, sweet malt notes. The body is a transparent yellow/gold color and holds a diminishing, wispy white head.

It smells of fruits and flowers. The taste is of fruits and caramel. The alcohol is well hidden beneath all the flavors. Sip this one slowly and enjoy one of the best beers in the world.
"
1," 750 ml bottle shared with my son. Pours a murky medium brown with gold and red highlights. Large off white head. Minimal lace. I enjoyed this Belgian more than some Ive had because it was not so heavily carbonated. Taste was of dark fruits, brown sugar, and  a slight alcohol presence. Finish was mild and dry. I will admit I do not own a  Tulip or Trappist style glass, so I may have missed some flavors that others may taste.

1," 500 ml flip-top bottle in Germany. Everytime I see the Bavarians (even the Franks) trying to make a Pils, it is like the North Germans doing the same with a Hefe. Anyway was this a Pils or a Helles? It feels like a Helles but looks and acts like a Pils. It is kind of both in my mind. All the Danes that rated this already could care less and just reated it as a beer. Alcohol is too low for a Helles but it is too sweet for a Pils. Bad it was not.

1," pint at brewery - Aroma is strong freshly roasted coffee and chocolate malt with a touch of hops.  Pours solid black with a small brown head and good lacing.  Flavor matches aroma with the coffee standing out.  Palate is sticky and creamy.  By far the best brew BI has to offer.
"
1," (bottle, with thanks to Quack-Duck) Clear, golden colour with a big and slightly tanned foamy head. Sweet and slightly cara-malty aroma with a bready touch and a shy whiff of herbal hops. Sweet and slightly bitter flavour, light to medium bodied and a bit fizzy on the tongue. Pale and cara-malty taste with a sweet-bitter herbal and spicy hoppy blend at the end. Decent brew (12.III.09).
"
1," Pour is a dark brown with no head at all.  Aroma is dark fruit with some candi sugar and some of the alcohol.  Flavor is almost a candi sugar bomb.  After the swallow some dark chocolate and cherries are left on the tounge to rescue it.  A very slight alcohol is there to give you a nice warm feeling.  This is a well made beer and you can tell a lot of work went into it but it is also a tad too sweet.
"
1," Cask conditioned - handpump - Market Porter Borough London.  A copper coloured bitter with a dry, faintly fruity aroma.  The taste was quite bland with some fruit.  However there was a certain tasty crispness to the beer which gave it a reasonable mark.
"
1," APR 7, 2006 33cl bottle.  Bottle conditioned.  Pours a murky dark amber / brown.  (I poured a decent amt. of the dregs, I just couldnt bear to leave too much beer in the bottle.)  ~1cm tan head that dissipated quickly into a nice layer of foam.  Great spicy, fruity, distinctly belgian aroma.  (I am pretty new to belgians, so I dont have a better way of describing it yet.)  I would assume Im getting some esters and cloves.  Flavor doesnt necessarily live up to what I expected out of the aroma.  Just doesnt seem to be all that complex.  Just a kind of bitter with a distinct belgian aftertaste, but doesnt seem to be a ton there.  A little yeasty and herby.  Mouthfeel is highly carbonated and light.  Its good, but for the price there has to be much better dubbels out there.  I do have to add that the flavor did get a little better and more complex as the beer warmed.  The last sip was better than the first.  Lesson learned.
"
1," Bu sur place le 28/8/08, en fut (10 oz). Pure noir, moyen collet beige  lazote. Arome de malte sucr doux, avoine dlicieuse. Got davoine malt doux, sucr et peu amre. Une stour solide et agrable!
"
1," Poured a dark red / brown color with a large off white head. Aromas and flavours -plums / other fruits, possibly caramel. Slightly spicy with moderate sweetness. The high alcohol content wasnt as noticeable as I was expecting it to be. Bottled in 2008.
"
1," 300ml vom Fass at the brewpub in the middle of the shopping center West Park in Ingolstadt. Unfiltered spezialbier that got a cloudy, dark brown body under low brownish foam stand. Poor in aroma except for hints of berries (blackcurrant). Fruity taste mixed with dark malts and a light touch of caramel sweetness. Gives an anonymous impression (22.06.2007).
"
1," Pours an orange around the edge with a cloudy blueish center.The aroma is a nice sweet fruit.The flavor is like the aroma but with more of a banana note to it.The finish is smooth with a mild banana aftertaste.Overall another very good beer from belgium.
"
1," A light brown colour, with a good head. Spicy aroma, with a sweet taste. An okey beer, but the Chimay bleu is the best from this brewery.
"
1,"  Golden in color.  There wasn't much head to it.  There was a little bit of lacing down the side of the glass.  Slight grapefruit nose of hops.  There was a medium body of matls, with a semi-bitter finish.  An OK session beer, but the ""Imperial"" in the name deceives you into feeling that there may be more to the beer.
"
1," Bottle shared by IMtheOptimator.  Pretty ample light brown head with a thick brown body.  Aroma of frash grains and some brown sugar and molasses.  First impression is this is over-carbonated.  It leaves me feeling like Im drinking foam, not liquid, so its hard to even get to the flavor.  After a few minutes the flavors start to come out.  That graininess sticks around from the aroma, in both the palate and the flavor.  The brown sugar is there as well, coming along with a distinct bourbon note at times.  Coffee.  Tasty, but not my fav.
"
1," This beer pours a medium brown body with a nice foamy head.  Not a lot of retention.  Aroma is very tart hops with some pine notes.   Flavor pretty much matches the aroma.  Some malt can be found underneath the hops but definitely play second fiddle to the hops.  Blind Tiger is a straight forward beer that ambushes the taste buds with tart hops.  Its not a bad one, either.
"
1," Nice head with some laces. nose is fat and sweet - almost Blonde - like. nice body and fine length. taste is a litle sweet with grains and gras.Delicious.
"
1," Bottle. Pretty clean and crisp, with not much flavour to speak of. Some grassy bitterness. But mostly just crisp and light.
"
1," Dark brown lively brew from a monastary, with flowery and roasty taste.
"
1," Not at all an exciting or inspiring beer.  I would like to elaborate on it, but I feel like I am sort of wasting my time writing this.  Prost!
"
1," Really sharp and utterly dry Trappist. Not very much to my liking. Foamed a lot from the bottle, very dark color but taste is not for me. Gladly, the aftertaste is gone like a gust of wind. Not my favorite.
"
1," Bottle... monumental beer. Full of flavor and character. Just the right amount of sweetness with a bitter finish. Nothing overpowering, just right. I LOVE it!
"
1," Bottle, 5%. Papery malt aroma. Cloudy amber colour. Big head, quite stable. The flavour is quite malty, turns roasted. A bit spicy, a Dunkelweizen? (does not say on the label). The finish is a little muddy. Very high carbonation. Interesting, but not very clean.
"
1,"	Pears and citrus fruit aplenty garnish this IPAs plump cereals, taking you to a potent resinous bitterness. 		Further Personal Perceptions"
1," Clear dark gold pour with a thin white head.  Toasted malts on the nose.  Pine and citrus flavor.  Thin bodied
"
1," A dark brown beer that has a yeasty aroma.  While I enjoyed the initial flavor of the beer, there was an aftertaste that I wasnt pleased with.   There was definitely a carbonated bubbly feel on the tongue, that I found pleasant.  This a good beer, but if given a choice, I would prefer to try something else.
"
1," This is quite good! I like the yeasty aroma with dark fruit overtones. Appearance is beautiful, cloudy burnt amber with a nice off-white matching head. Slightly bitter, nice sensation on the tongue. I like this ale very much. I like all the Chimay's very much!
"
1," A fairly mild IPA. Pours a hazy orange, with a quickly diminishing white head. Average floral hop aroma. Unfiltered honey color with a medium uneven head. Mild bitterness with a dry finish. Did not enjoy this and was very hard to finish, nearly a drain pour.
"
1," Bottle - very big thick head, dark amber color, sweet malty aroma, sweet malty flavor with that Belgian yeast kick, almost a little bit of a chocolate flavor in there as well - very good beer
"
1," Bottle.  Pours a murky orange with a thick, creamy white head.  Initial aroma was of skunk, which got fainter as the beer warmed, but was still present.  Taste of light fruits (but no distinguishable tastes), spices.  Bitter finish.  This was good, but lacked the complexity of the Bleu or even the Dubbel.
"
1," clear orange, smooth white head.	nice citrussy flowery aroma, fresh.	flavor is citrussy, grapefruity, slightly malty, great balance.
"
1," Tap - small foamy head, medium amber color, very swet malty aroma and flavor
"
1," Bottle 500ml.Clear medium to dark yellow orange color with a average to large, frothy, good lacing, mostly lasting, white head. Aroma is moderate malty, toasted, fruity notes, light to moderate hoppy, light butter and sugar. Flavor is moderate to heavy sweet and light to moderate bitter with a average to long duration, butter notes. Body is medium, texture is oily to watery, carbonation is soft. [20100225]
"
1," This brew is a copper-brown color with a medium thin beige head. Malt and caramel in the nose. Medium bodied with a blend of malt, hops and caramel flavors. The finish is lightly bitter hops. This is an interesting take on a Brown Ale, as it isn't really even that brown. Cool name too.
"
1," Not as heavy as I expected, almost looks watery in the trappist glass.  Smells great , tastes better.  Slight dried fruit/porter taste. Good stuff but its only the first Chimay Ive tasted.
"
1," Dark red-brown colour with a fast disappearing white head. The aroma is a bit to strong but complex. The taste is sweet and fruity with a hoppy undertone. (Bottle 33cl)
"
1," Bottled.	Slightly fraught yellow color, with optimal head and good bubbly aspect. Light anise and hoppines aroma but rather inconsistent scent. Gaunt and on the whole altogether rather watery. I save a pleasant bitter on the end and a lively and rather crisp body.
"
1," A filthy looking dark dark brown beer with a light tan head that doesnt last. The aroma contains very dark notes of chocolate, with some fruits (cherry). The flavor contains considerable alcohol heat, with more dark fruit, molasses, and belgian yeasty spiciness. and peppery.
"
1," Trappist glass.	A nice dark Ruby colour with a great foamy white head that lingers, so you can savour this one. Its like a good red wine that has loads of culture, and loads to talk about. My favourite Chimay. One to respect. At 9 percent strength, you cant taste it.. Good lace effects on the glass that shows quality. The aroma is quite complex, you have the yeast foremost, with a slight roasted nut hue to it. The tase is much appreciated once you have a few sips. Yeasty, roasted nutty, with slight sweet hints of fruits and caramel, the aftertaste is exquisite too, not too bitter considering the yeast and strength. A well rounded one with loads of complexity like a fine wine.	A must have!!!
"
1," Bottle looks really good as well as the beer in the glass. Dark, nice head. Yeasty-malty aroma. Starts strong, quite yeasty, fruity like orange. Finish more and more malty, a bit sourish, unbalanced. Not really drinkable. Not my favourite.
"
1," Malty and strong - yet bitter enough to balance the sweetness of the malt.
"
1," 11.2 oz bottle.  This has been my favorite beer for probably ten years.  Much to my chagrin, I try it tonight, and I find it getting a lower score than some other beers Ive rated.  I only got a two ounce sample tonight, maybe thats why?  Maybe because its not in the 750 ml cork bottle that I usually drink it from?  I dont know.  I do know the aroma is nothing to write home about and the appearance looks like diarrhea.  The flavor, as ever, is as good as beer gets.  My overall impression, even from this two ounce sample, is 19/20, which means I dont give much stock to the aroma or appearance.  This is a phenomenal tasting beer.  I think I will re-rate this beer when I get a 750.
"
1," Poured to a hazy golden color with thick white head that diminished quickly, and good lacing. Strong wheat aroma, but the flavor was dominated by spices, mostly corriander, clove and cinnamon. Actually much better than I expected, and the spices left a good finish. The spices may become overwhelmiong if drinking several of these at once, but a very good tasting beer for sipping.
"
1," Cloudy brownish red color with a stable white head...lively carbonation.  Grapes, yeast, and other spices.  Dry bready flavor with an uderlying alcohol presence.  Good first trappist ale.
"
1," Pours a beautiful hazy medium brown with an inch of  nice khaki head.  A good amount of sediment in this bottle. Smells like figs, grapes, dates, its dark and sweet.  Taste is not as fruity as the smell leads on.  A good body and feeling in the mouth.   Excellent  drinkability for the abv and flavor.  This beer will always be a belgian favorite.
"
1," Damn Good.  Thats all I can remember, this was the first beer I tried at beerfest in Orlando yesterday.  My rankings from Beerfest are as follows, Damn Good, Good, Alright, Bad, Runaway.
"
1," Dry and sour aroma is fruity, apple, citrus, spices and some yeast. Very hoppy, floral flavor is fruity, apple, citrus, spices and yeast.
"
1," 50 cL bottle. Pours unclear brown with a slowly collapsing tan head. Mild spiced and roasted malty aroma. Light chocolate note. A bit fizzy mouthfeel and slowly gusing after opening. Smooth chocolate and roasted malty note. Light bitterness too. Mild hoppy note into the finish too. Smooth and nice.
"
1," From a 12oz bottle - Pours pitch black in color with small caramel colored.  Slightly below average carbonation.  Smells of roasted malts and some coffee.   First sip is smooth with roasted malts and coffee leading the way.  There is a fairly nice malt backbone. Dark chocolate notes also presence. Very nice and drinkable.  Some bourbon in the finish.
"
1," 330 mL bottle.  Dark brown with small fluffy light tan head.  Aroma of dark fruit, sugar, yeast, and alcohol.  Satin bright palate.  Taste of brown sugar, molasses, slight roastiness, and an alcoholic warmth to the finish.
"
1," Big River Disney World-Southern Flyer Light Lager(Gordon Biersch)-on tap-pours a thin white head with straw color.  Aroma is grain.  Taste is grain and watery.  Its OK, but, yes its a light.
"
1," JAN 21, 2006 This beer has a dark bown body - hue apperance and a coarse light brown scum collar. I have drunk the beer from the bottle and it had not much carbonic acid. The initial flavor taste is sweet and spicy.
"
1," Bottle from Cavie.  Light orange pour with a white head.  Aroma is sour, lots and lots of corn, and steamed veggies.  Taste is sour, a little citrus, and more corn.
"
1," the aroma, the appearance, the taste and  the finish. Simply gorgeous.
"
1," Poured an opaque black color with a huge tan head that left light lacing on the glass.  Aroma of creamy milk chocolate, vanilla, roasted malts, nuts, and dried fruit in the background.  Taste of roasted coffee, chocolate, faint hoppiness.  Carbonation / gritty mouthfeel, though it was still nice.
"
1," Bottle thanks to thirdeye11.  The look is yellow in color, light white head, and clear.  The smell is citrus, pine, hops, and caramel.  The taste is the same as the smell.
"
1," Dark red color,small off white head that faded slowly and left little behind.Malty caramel aroma with a slight hint of metallic coming through along with some mild hops.Sweet caramel taste with a decent hop presence and mild biterness at the end.It is a fairly smooth brew that is surprisingly easy to drink.I could go for more of these,but i think the sweetness would eventually get a little old.Thanks go to Jpdipso for sending this brew my way.

"
1," On tap at Mad Anthonys Octobeer Fest.  I had several samples of this, hoping to get more out of it given what Id heard of it.  Some guy said that this beer varies greatly by batch, and I must have gotten one of the weak batches.  Dark beer with a creamy brown head.  Almost smokey burnt wood nose.  Very subtle bourbon barrel flavors.  Almost honey sweetness with raw oak woodiness.  Much lighter in body than I expected.
"
1," Dark copper, brown pour with a frothy head.  Nice smooth maltiness with floral tones, caramels and citrus tones as well.  Delightfully easy to drink.
"
1," brown with reddish reflections, beige head, light effervescence; nose "
1," Bottle from LCBO. Drank with a chicken curry dish. Pours a dark reddish-brown with an intense amount of head. Nose is of rasberry and strawberries, and smells very sweet and rosy. Mouthfeel is creamy and the tongue is hit by a very tart and spicy flavour. Palate is fairly simple, and once again, I am disappointed by the complexity of Chimay. Lacing is heavy on the glass and looks rather attractive in a snifter. A decent brew, but I will not be buying again.
"
1," JUL 26, 2010 Poured a dark reddish orange/brown with a medium off-white head. The aroma and taste is a mix of caramel malts, dried fruits, mild spice, brown sugar. Medium body, good depth & balance, medium carbonation. Overall"
1," Bottle at Tommys Joynt in SF. The body was dark gold with a fluffy white head. The aroma was strongly sweet corn with some peanuts. The taste was bread and cereal with a bitter apple core finish. Harsh and grainy in the finish.
"
1," I thought this was a terrible example of this style.  Unbalanced with the wrong type of hops.  Light and watery, and overly bitter.
"
1," Received in a trade with mmm///beer, so thanks bro.  The beer was quite nice actually, with enough hops to satisfy this West Coast hop head.  No it wasnt a flat out assault on the senses, but subtley has its place and it had a place in this beer.		The beer poured out a clear, medium/dark amber color with a 2-finger light tan head.  Aroma was mostly citrusy, slightly vegetative, a bit astringent, with a light toasted malt angle.  Flavor had notes of citrus, a bit iced tea to it, some minor malt sweetness but the thing that suprised me at how dry it was, which really seemed to amplify the hoppage.  Nice beer!
"
1," pours a bubbly cloudy with sediment copper with persistant white fizzy head.  sweet citrus hop aroma.  mild front with acidic hints to mild bitter finish and dry aftertaste.  mild hops showing a light citrus finish.
"
1," JAN 15, 2003 Not quite as impressed as I""d hoped to be.  Dark brown color, decent but thin head, aroma not strong either.  Nice spicy flavor, but a little on the bitter side.
"
1," Relatively fresh 330 ml bottle.		Pours a murky brown with a fairly light  tan-colored head. The aroma is cut apples and brown sugar, a bit leafy, mildly sweet, Belgian yeast of course. Peppery flavor (think Dr. Pepper), again a bit of cut apples, banana, and pear, again gently sweet.	Refined and well-crafted, but it isnt knocking me out on this sampling. On the other hand, its been a long day and perhaps its me.
"
1," From bottle. Brown pout with big white creamy head. Spicey, fruity aroma. Flavor is lightly spicey and sweet, balanced with belgian candi sugars. Lots of belgian yeast and some bread.  The mouthfeel is excellent. When I was just getting into beer, this was one of the best Id ever had. Its still pretty damn good.
"
1," Pours a clear, mahogany-hued body with a 1 inch head of off-white foam.		Smell"
1," Hazy straw yellow, white head.  Bananas in the aroma.  Fair amount of banana in the flavor, and not enough clove to balance.  Seemed a bit fruity for style and some hints of lemon.  I note its here in Ratebeer as an american wheat, tho the bartender told me its a german style hefe.
"
1," (12oz bottle, courtesy of Cavie)  Pours a clear yellow body with a small white head.  Aroma of corn, grass, and grain.  Flavor of corn, citrus, nuts, and light grassiness.
"
1," FEB 13, 2007 Havent sampled this one in a while. I remember it being creamy, and fruity with hints of apricoty sweetness. I may have to try this again.
"
1," Bottle@Home. Guess this has all it needs as a German Weizen. Banana, sweetish, light bitter, hint of citrus. Stuff like that. Not exceptional but certainly nice.
"
1," APR 30, 2008 Dark brown with white head. lively carbonation. Very strong and harder to get into compared with the other trappist, though more commercial. You can feel the great carbonation and well balanced feel this beer has. Long great finish! ReRate"

1," SEP 28, 2005 Another trappist beer....but one of the best I have ever tried ! I actually prefer the one from rochefort, but this one is really just behind...Some strong aroma. The appearance looks really atractive... If you have the possibilty to try this one or the ""grande reserve one"", which is a ""millsime"", youre a lucky man !
"
1," cloudy and quite disgusting amber-orange colour, no foam, very unusual aroma of potatoes, smoked bacon and pumpkin, notes of lemon, sweet and slightly oily, medium-bodied, the finish is moderately long and shows more smoke and meat notes - one of the most unusual beer I have ever had (and I have had already a few ...) - thanks to Per for this one !
"
1," JUL 8, 2008 Dry at first, but is gets more complex the more you drink.  I really like this.  The smell is yeasty.  The color is a beautiful cider-red.  Nice fluffy head that lingers.  Good stuff.  Similar to Westmalle Dubbel, but a little cheaper
"
1," Hazy brown beer with creamy light beige head. Good maltyness some caramel, some spices and dried fruits. Taste is smooth soft malt, has some dry fruit accents and a nice touch of spices.
"
1," 11.2oz bottle.  Aroma is yeast, sweet malts. Large off-white head that mostly diminished and left little lace.  Deep dark murky brown amber hue with lots of small particles.  Flavor is malty and yeasty but not as much as the white.  Medium bodied and lively.  Another crappy chimay.  Best to never buy them again.
"
1," Bottle in Chimay Glass. Pours deep rich brown with creamy tan head. Strong slightly sour aroma with overtones of fruit. Strong complex malt taste, nice rich body. Damn fine beer.
"
1," Tap, EPCOT, 3/04.  Cloudy amber/red with foamy head that lasted nicely.  Good looking beer.  Strong cascade aromas, mild, but pungent.  Nice malt front and hop back that balances well.  Melons and underripe pears, caramel.  Yum!  Crisp, smooth, slightly astringent finish, too.
"
1," Rather grainy, sweet, mild maltiness.
"
1," 750ml corktop bottle from the LCBO. Pours a beautiful dark brown/red with a thick beige head with a tint of red. Aroma is caramel and malt. Slightly spicy. Taste is somewhat sweet with Belgian yeast, caramel and malt. Some spices. bread like flavour with some toffee. 	Nothing in the flavour stands out as being really bold. This is a solid well rounded and balanced beer.

1," Bottle, 12 oz. Pours light amber with a white head. Malt and yeast aroma. Sweet and malty flavors. Easy to drink; very nice.

1," Draught.  Pours orange yellow with thick white head. Much lacing.  Piney aroma with   bietjie citrus.  Full bodied flavour with a citrus and floral note.  Hoppy finish.  Good balance

1," watery and roasted malts. Has a lack of taste.
"
1," Intriguing subtext.   Its easy to be lost in this potent masterpiece.    The color is a deep brown.    The aroma tantilates with spice, fruit, and yeast.    The ale is a complexly interwoven set of tastes ranging from spicey to malty.    Sweet and sexy.   Easy to drink.   Easy to love.

1, 5/30/2004 Total Score
1," Bottled sample. Clear copper in colour with fairly strong carbonation. PIne lumber upfront in the nose, backed by sme white grapefruit, nutty malts and faint caramel. More pine wood in the mouth, but it takes on an additional sap quality as well. White grapefruit shows up a bit more here too. Solid chunky black pepper bitterness. I didnt get a whole lot of Amarillo notes out of this beer, but Cascade and Centennial are here in spades. A solid (somewhat safe) IPA overall. Good.
"
1," Bottle received via trade with StFun.  Aroma of vanilla and whiskey.  Flavor was very nice, mellow oak, smoke, malt and toffee that mellowed into a pleasant smooth and warming aftertaste.  A good local IN beer that would do well on a national stage.

1," 33cl bottle Fakta. Pours tan with a milky head almost like cream when it settles.Prunes and banana.So smooth with the alcohol well hidden Soft strong and beautifull.Superb trappist beer.Thanks to Defreni.

1," It poured a reddish brown color with a cloudy head. The aroma was raisins, spice, plum, citrus and malts. The taste was about the same as the aroma.  A very good trio of beers.

1," malt and dried apricots on the nose, beautiful dark copper colour with very high carbonation, light spicy alcohol taste, malt flavour is like a mild dark chocolate, dried fruits especially banana, light bitterness that compliments the beer nicely.

1," Bottle. Not an IPA. Quite malty flat and sweet. Some toasty malt. Quite salty, with some toffee-apple and tea. Really flat, dull mouthfeel. A bit stale even though it was well within its use-by date.

1," Dont know if its because Chimays famed variability or what but the bottle I had wasnt nearly as good as I remembered.  The fizz overwhelmed everything else after a few seconds in the mouth, which is really tragic.  Taste was good but didnt get anything special out of it.
"
1," Golden colour. Dense spicy hop aroma. Reasonably malty and rather sweet with medium bitterness. Fruity, sweet finish.
"
1," 12oz bottle pours dark amber with a short offwhite head.  Aromas of grapefruit, slight pine and lots of floral notes.  Flavor is pretty well balanced with some pineapple notes over bready malts.  Slight spice and lots of bitterness at the finish.  Medium bodied with good balance.
"
1," Dark brown pour, with an initially fizzy head.  Minimal lacing.  Sweet aroma with some clove and yeast.  Taste is sweet with some brown sugar, dried fruit, yeast and a nice maltiness.  Alcohol warms the throat.  Overall, Im not really sure why its rated so high.  Its a great brew, but not as good as trois pistoles or maudite, which are rated lower.
"
1," Courtesy of jdubFL. Pours clear copper with thin white head. The aroma is spoiled moldy earthiness, spicy hops and sour citrus. I like the smell. The taste is pretty crisp with modest levels of spicy hops and mild malt sweetness and seemingly little else.
"
1," Nice bit of bourbon on the nose, along with some chocolate.  Flavor is surprisingly subtle for a barrel aged stout, but very well integrated, nuanced, and balanced.
"
1," 33 cl bottle. Dark brown color with a large creamy light brown head, that lasts. Aroma of roasted malt and dark chocolate. Flavor is roasted malts, alcohol,and spices. A bit thin mouthfeel. Complex beer with a long aftertaste of malt and alcohol.

1," got this as a present from a mate for christmas. Corked bottle, very thick in the mouth, soft and fruity with a toffee malt

1," Dark brown body with a lasting head. Loved the the flavor. Very intrigued to learn about the process the monks use. Fantastic drink.
"
1," A shame this isnt made on-premises any more. Along with the IPA, this was one of Sailor Hagars best offerings and one of the best in BC.
"
1," FEB 18, 2003 This is the ale that all others should be measured against. Absolutely perfect balance of spices, malts and creaminess. Great mellow attack, full soft complex middle, with some tones of bitterness, and spices. Fruitiness around the middle palate and then a burst of bitters and creamy ending. 	This is perfection in a bottle, and cellar bottles for future consumption. They get mellower and longer with age. What a prize.
"
1," Pours a thick brown with reddish hues and an amber head.  You can smell the chocolate and caramel as you sink your nose into the wide mouth of your trappist glass.  As you let a mouthfull of beer sit on your tongue, you are struck by the complex tastes of molasses, caramel, and roasted malt as well as the tickle of alcohol.  This is an excellent strong ale that must be shared with friends!
"
1," Poured a clear light brown color with a white head that faded quickly.  Aroma had a toasted grain and caramel note to it.  Flavor had a little more of bread like notes and some sweetness to it almost like brown sugar.  Body seemed a little thin, but not enough to totally ruin the beer.  Evenly balanced and smooth. A nice beer.
"
1," pours a burnt amber color with a thin head that still yields nice lacing. A very pleasent and welcomed honey almond aroma. The flavor is extrmely deep, hints of fruits raisins nuts and a well hidden alcohol. the mouthfeel is nigh majestic. Nice carbonation and coats the mouth well with a long aftertaste. This is one of the better beers i have tasted.
"
1," Mobile rating. Malt forward, smooth, creamy like butter, but tastes like butter as well.  Weak and flabby body, lactic nose, butterscotch. No thanks.
"
1," Very very unique. A bit sweet but nice and strong. A great compliment to the other two chimays
"
1," MAR 11, 2009 Poured from a bottle.  Poured a syrupy-brown color with a moderate white head.  Aroma of yeast and some dark fruits.  Taste is hard to describe, yeasty, slightly roasted, with sweet toffee flavors as well as undertones of dark fruits.  Nice, full feel on the palate.  Quite the beer.
"
1," Birra che riesce nelllmpresa di rendere in equilibrio ed armonia elementi tra loro contrastanti; alcol al naso insieme al luppolo e ai malti, al palato e amara e leggermente acidula e sfuma in un equilibrato finale fruttato.
"
1," Big off-white head of ultra-fine bubbles.  A bit over carbonated, but that may be due to the long cellaring.  This is my last bottle of Chimay (I bought a red, blue and Primiere), and I hope I like this one as well as I did the others.		Nose is of yeast, bread, subtle clove and anise.  complex, yet very delicate.  The color is a deep brown/red.		First taste gives hints of lemon, clove, anise and malt, but in such a complete, harmonious blend it's hard to tell one influence from another.  It's a fairly big ale, but isn't overly alcoholic.		I like the completeness of this ale--It's smooth, complex and filling without blowing me out of my chair.
"
1," This beer poured a large tan head with fine-small sized bubbles.The body of this beer was clear and the hue was red.The nose was malty and hoppy.This beer left an excellent lacing on the sides of my glass.The flavor was very bitter and it left an aftertaste that lingered for some time.The mouthfeel was smooth, but this beer reminded me of a Pale Ale as it was very hoppy.

1," Bottle @ Ulfborg Easter Tasting, 2011. Pours clear golden with bubbles on top. Sweet nose. Peach, butter and dust. Medium to thin body. Odd... Very thin!
"
1," Poured black with a large head, aroma was faint but good. Flavor was a good balanced stout, a hint of sweetness but mostly bitterness. A good dark chocolate taste. Malt and hops blend perfectly. Smooth but not watery. Excellent stout.
"
1," Spicy lighter chimay.  Peppery fruits and a red zing slipping in my throat.  all happy and good in bed.  but give me the blue... the blue... what a beautiful bootle to make you happy every time you see it...but..a favorite beer but ... i know its all about the blue...
"
1," 33cl bottle in brussels. Pours a medium dark borwn with lots of tan heady. Nutty roasted aroma mixed with a slightly sweet fruity flavor. So smooth you cant bleive is 9%. An all-around great beer.
"
1," Bottle, bought @ Riepen, Niebll.	Clear golden with a staying, frothy, white head. Aroma has lots of sweet malts, light hay. Medium carbonation, light dry and a bit watery. Flavour has some metallic dryness, lots of sweet brewing cereal malts and some sugary notes. FInish is mild grassy dry and bitter. Okay beer.
"
1," Poured with very creamy and somewhat rocky off-white head.  Head had good rentention and showed nice lacing.  Nose is of plum, and clove, reminds me of weizein bock a little.  Favor is malty caramel and has a nice warming effect.  Very good carbonation.
"
1," Who hasnt had Chimay? It is what is.		Im not a big fan considering how commerical its gotten.
"
1," Hazy mahogany pour supporting a medium light tan but rapidly dissipating head and .good lacing.  a little alcohol and dark fruit sweetness in the aroma along with just a hint of roasted malt - very earthy.  Malty, sweet flavor that was consistent with the earthy aroma.  Lively carbonation and a fairly dry finish.  Drinking it from a Chimay goblet as I type and, thankfully, I had the foresight to buy the big bottle so I can refill the goblet a few times.
"
1," Light tan with little head.  Slight carbonation.  Aroma is malty and little else.  Flavour is light and watery with nothing really specialexcept some light herb notes.  Finish is thin and forgettable.
"
1," 4.4% 13.4 IBU (listed on the blackboard at the brewpub) - Pale orange/yellow. Lemony, crisp hoppiness. Pleasant and lends itself to long pulls. Surprising hop power in this.
"
1," Opaque dark brown color with thin white head.  Aroma fruity, with floral yeasty and clove notes.  Palate smooth and the carbonation is balanced.  Taste is mildly sweet and spicy, with a bitter/sour finish that seems aggressive at first, but once the beer warms, it complements the other tastes.
"
1," APR 14, 2004 Had a small bottle with an excellent Italian dinner in Las Vegas. What a treat. Very complex and has lots of fruit flavor, but it is not distracting. Still has a robust body. Just enough bitterness.
"
1," From the first smell to the flavors rushing over my tongue is impressive. I cant believe beer can be this good!
"
1," good made lager
"
1," Reddish brown with a off-white head. Sweet, caramel, plums...both fresh and dried...undefined spices...yeast. Some alcohol warmth but its not intruding. Complex and interesting.
"
1," The chimay pours easy enough without too much head and lace, with a dark cloudy look, it smells like a mixture of sweet and spicy. The drink goes down smooth with a bit of spiciness too it that makes it that much better
"
1," not too bad of an ipa. aroma and flavor are grapefruit, orange, and pine with some malt to off  set things. a little bit light in the body and some good head and lacing. not bad.
"
1," Very nice brew. Smooth, full of flavor, tasty. Don't really have anything negative to say about it. I'll sure try some more of this.
"
1," Chimay	Grande Reserve	Pours hazy brown with a medium cream colored head and medium retention. Strong aroma of yeast, cloves, nutmeg and slight alcohol. Taste is slightly sweet and slightly bitter and yeasty funk with a nice warm finish. Crisp mouthfeel from all the bubbles. Good Brew.
"
1," Strong indeed.  There was a lot going on with the flavors of this beer.  There was a lot of sweet and the hops added depth, complimenting the sweetness and making it all three dimensional.  I would not recommend having food with this beer, it may be too much.
"
1," Tap, copper/yellow, somewhat hazy. Fruity aroma that fills your senses with some apricot, candied malts, and other complex fruity, dry hints. The fun begins when you taste bitter yet creamy mix and a slightly dry intervention. Silky but bitter. Awesome
"
1," Bottle from Sainsburys. It pours deep red-brown, with a quickly dissipating bubbly off-white head. The nose is sweet fruit, varnish, wood, earth, salted liquorice, raspberry and floral. The taste is wood, astringency, currant, raisin, grapefruit, earth, alcohol warmth, chocolate and liquorice, with a dry-woody finish. It is medium bodied and has sharp carbonation. Decent enough.
"
1," On tap at the John Harvards in Springfield PA.  Pours a ruby red amber with a medium off whie creamy head that left light lacing.  Aroma of orange and various other citrus.  A little light for what I was expecting from this beers aroma...expecting more from the Simcoe.  Flavor of pine, orange, grapefruit and some malt balance.  Very light bitterness for the 80+ IBUs they said this one had.
"
1," When I popped this one open it was light, sweet and fruity.  It poured hazy brown with a thick head.  It was hoppy and very carbonated, but was nice and sweet and refreshing.
"
1," Deep murky reddish brown with a pretty thick light tan head. Pleasant sweet aroma with lots of trademark Belgain candi sugar. Roasty flavor with tons of Belgian yeast and candi sugar. A little bit spicy, even. Palate is big and creamy. Not much to say other than this is an amazing beer.
"
1," Bottle, served at cellar temperature...  Poured deep, foggy ruby with a beige head that formed massive and quickly.  Aroma of thick malt and lurking alcohol.  Big sizzle on the tongue with a nice sting.  Flavors of big malt and brown sugar and other fruity flavors like apples.  Finished with a wine-like aftertaste.
"
1," Pours a cloudy, deep orange color with large head.  Smells yeast and sweet.  Nice floral, peppery taste.  Amazing mouthfeel, as I didnt know a beer could feel as soft in the mouth.  Finish is a little bitter with an unoffensive alcoholic bite.
"
1," Giant head, almost too much so. Deep brown in color with a flowery aroma that hints of earthy fruits and honey. Flavor is very mellow to start with the same earthy fruits, flowers and some rasin. Towards the end of the bottle there was a hint of spice possibly the yeast. The bottle I had could have been cellared a lot longer but was still greatly enjoyable. The best belgian ale I have had yet. Would recommend this to anyone.
"
1," A very tasty trappist. Plenty of delicious, musky flavours and potent alcoholic heat. Deep and meaningful but without the layers of some of its harder-to-find cousins.  The carbonation is hefty and makes the booze go straight to the head.
"
1," Bottled. Dark mahogany. Aroma of red grapes and saffron. Sweet with clean mouthfeel and light body. Some grass and licorice, medium bitterness. An odd beer.
"
1," 50 cL bottle, courtesy of Papsoe. Pours clear and golden yellow with a fully gone head. Dry cornish and vague malty aroma. Bitter and light fruity flavoured to a light caramel malt note. Crisp bitterness into the finish. Nice one.
"
1," Pours a dark copper with a nice white head.  Aromas of belgian yeasts, fruit, and a little caramel.  Flavors of sweet malt, belgian yeast, fruit, spices, and a hint of caramel.  Finishs with a little alcohol bite.  Not as good as blue, but still worth trying.
"
1," Bottled.  Dark with red tints.  Aromas are floral, earthy and citrus.  Flavours are caramel and chocolate with some citrus which is odd for a porter.  Too much carbonation.  Some earthines that I would expect but doesnt seem true to the style.
"
1," Bottle. Pours a ruby red/brownish beer with a good head. Dark fruits and brown sugar in the aroma. Taste is really good. Full mouthfeel with bitter notes. Liked this great dubbel.
"
1," Too dry and a bit flavorless when old or stored improperly, but a great modest ale suitible for a hearty meal of simple food when young.  A fine beer for dinner time.
"
1," A tasty number, with a smooth entrance.  Bitter finish, tangy.  Good aroma, nice creamy head.
"
1," 750ml bottle. from notes, aroma is red fruits, taste is a bit simple. Rating #71
"
1," High carbonation.  Too much for my taste.  Big malt flavor with noticable hop notes trying to balance it.  Definate finishing yeast presence.  Better than Chimay's Cinq Cents in my book.
"
1," Draught at the Hamilton Place location. Pours clear, pale straw yellow with tight white head. The aroma is quite herbal with some notes that remind me of hair conditioner (aloe, maybe?), and a very pronounced almond. Flavor is light nutty malt with a bit of dried tropical fruit and some herbal hops. Clean finish, aftertaste is slight earth and bread. Really not that bad for what it is.
"
1," Dark-amber coloured, small fluffy, foamy layer; kind of perfumed aroma (cookies, caramel, roasted malts); starts slightly sweetish and malty; light bitter flavour, average typical bitter-sweet finish; drinkable, not very impressive...............
"
1," Rating # 100!!!! This is the beer that made me want to be adventurous about what I drank. Pours out cloudy and dark  with a big white head. Aroma is yeasty, like fresh baked bread and a hint of dark fruit, maybe fig. Taste has a spicy, malty, sweetness to it. Very balanced and smooth, this is a great beer.
"
1," (draught at the brewpub) Clear, golden colour with a mid-sized and slightly off-white foamy head. Sweet (cara-)malty aroma with notes of biscuits and herbal, slightly woody hops. Sweet flavour, light to medium bodied with a smooth carbonation. Pleasant malt-character with hints of caramel and biscuits; medium-dry malt-accented and delicately hoppy finish. Pleasant. 17.IV.11
"
1,"//www.ratebeer.com/Place/maine/augusta/l target=blank>Lous Beverage Barn, cellared for 10 mos. after purchase) Pours cloudy, rust-tinted reddish brown with one finger of tight, level khaki head. Aroma of yeast, red wine, candy, dark fruit, raisins, hints of brown sugar. Mouthfeel soft, with fine carbonation, smooth. Fine, weepy rings of lacing. Flavor is mostly about light red wine and yeast. Light brown sugar and candyish malt. Not a mind-blower but quite nice. More depth and complexity in aroma than in flavor.
"
1," Bottle	Honeyish herbal malt aroma.	Chestnut colour, low tanned head.	Honeyish sweet malt base and, unexpectedly, a very nice grassy and aromatic hop profile - lovely balance.	Mellow, slightly sparkly mouthfeel, grassy aftertaste. Now this is quite a beer...
"
1,"//news.ratebeer.com/Place/illinois/blue- Tree Inn. A happy, hazy beer smell wafts from the Trappist glass after its poured. Brown and hazy body with a surface skim of light foam, but no lacing. The smell lightens up once you put your nose in the glass. Taste includes impressions of brown sugar, rum, and a slight prune darkness. Despite the relatively light alcohol for this style, theres actually a kind of barley win maltiness to it. Works well as a casual summer drunking experience. And Jeezis Peet, Ive just checked off the Maple Trees beer menu"
1," Courtesy of Degarth. Dark brown pour...tan head...low retention...some sheet lacing...felt like this one was more of a dry stout than a sweet stout...some sweetness in the aroma and flavor, but very drying on the palate and the finish...definitely better than their APA, which was almost undrinkable.
"
1," Definitely in my top 10. Garnet colored, as complex as a good port and just seems to get better as you drink. I never get tired of this. Alcohol is well balanced.
"
1," NOV 20, 2006 (Re-rate, prev. 5/5/04,6-3-7-3-15). Dark brown colored, vasnihing light brown head. Lively carbonation. Spicy and licoricy aroma with sweet caramel tones, yeast and mild alcohol.  Medium to full bodied, surprisingly high carbonated. Flavor is not as rich as aroma"
1," Bottle @ Bamberg. Pours clear amber with a creamy white head. Caramel, nuts and earth. Smooth.
"
1," Incredible coffee aroma. Smells like fresh brewed ultra-premium coffee. I could just sit and smell this. Pours deep black with nice brown head that does not last long. Very smooth with tons of coffee flavor. I can tell there is malt sweetness there, but this is all coffee. Not bitter at all. Very drinkable. Well balanced. I want more of this.

1," 2007 bottle thanks to bu11zeye.  chocolate brown with an off white head.  chocolate and a familiar belgian yeast scent.  decent on the palate with a belgian yeast fruity flavor.
"
1," Bottle. Pours a deep reddish brown with a large white head. Aroma is of sweet malts and yeast.  Taste is pretty complex.  A lot of sweet malty caramel notes with a little hops but into big yeast taste and the end.  Overall, I have to get more into these type of beers, but I can see the infatuation with them from this one.
"
1," MAY 18, 2006 I find this to be the perfect beer.  Just the right combination of fruity.malty and alcohol flavors. The strain of yeast has a very destinctive taste that you cant find in any other brew. Ver very good ale.
"
1," 50 cL bottle. Pours dark brown to black with a small tan head. Aroma is dark malty, light cardboardish. Mild citric and cornish to the dark roasted malt. Thin body. Dark and roasted malt flavoured finish, subdued bitterness.

1," FEB 18, 2010 2010-02-18, parallel tasting, vintage 1988 (bb 1991), 22 years old, 7-3-7-3-14=34The cap is in good conditions, a bit rusty, but the rubber is still functional; it pours a brown color, initially with a small head, but that vanishes quickly in a whiff. Medium strength caramel aroma, with unmistakable oxidization vein, but not annoying; very light impression of dust and pond water too. It has a good body structure, stronger than most 20yearsold beers tasted so far, yet quite flat; caramel flavor, sweetish; the ageing created an extra flavor of mellow liquorice; almost no trace of bitterness, instead the sweetness is balanced by the alcohol, that is easily perceived through a pervasive warmth in the mouth. Interesting, but not outstanding.2010-02-18, parallel tasting, vintage 1998 (bb 2003), 12 years old, 7-4-6-3-13=33The cap is in good conditions; it pours a dark brown color, darker than the 1988; the head is initially large, but even after some time its still half a centimeter thick. Medium to light aroma, with some caramel and soap; also very light vanilla, wood, cake, nuts and Madeira; pleasant. Being more carbonated than the 1988, the mouthfeel seems lighter; its undoubtly less sweet, even if there is a residual sweetness; there is some caramel flavor, less oxidization, and equally lack of bitterness, as well as there is almost no alcohol warmth. The two beers are similar, but in 10 years the 1998 wont become like the 1988"
1," Nice hazy brown color. Arma includes alcohol, yeast and spices. Flavor is also spicy with hints of liquorice. Very complex brew that tends to grow on you.
"
1," Poured dark brown with a marshmallow like head. Great nose of dark fruits, spice, and belgian yeast. The taste is similar with belgian candy added along with fig. A great belgian style beer.
"
1," Opaque, black with a thick, overcarbed, chunky, light brown head.  Very nice vanilla and oak aroma coupled with a soft oatmeal, a warm, yeast fruit, and charcoal.  Carbonation and bitterness are overdone but underneath all of the aroma components are there with the roast creating a long, dry finish but also a hint of soy sauce.
"
1," The smaller bottle pours murky rich caramel color with about 1/2 inch tan, dissipating head. some lacing. Mild bready aroma with some sweet caramelized sugars. More appreciation for the malts comes with warming. Full flavor. Mild bitterness, almost like  aspirin, with sweet/sour , syrupy aftertaste.
"
1," Deep brown beer with off-white head.  Has a nice aroma of fruit and perfume.  Tastes of banana, apricot, fig, rum and a little chocolate.  Finishes very dry, very digestible.  Excellent.
"
1," (Bottle, 1998 vintage)  Pours a clear amber body with a small off-white head. Aroma of brandy, cigar, cherry, caramel, brown sugar, and oxidation.  Flavor of caramel malt, cherry, toffee, noticeable oxidation, and old sock.
"
1," The aroma is sweet and yeasty. The color is amber and it has a beutiful white head. The flavor is sweet malty with dominant notes of caramel. An OK beer.
"
1," GABF 2010.  Pours clear gold with a small, fizzy white head, low retention with flat lacing.  Aroma is heavy malt (grainy, meal, cereal), light hops (spicy), and light esters (fruity) with notes of corn.  Flavor is heavy malt (grainy, meal, cereal), light hops (spicy), and light esters (fruity).  Light body, low warmth and creaminess, medium carbonation with a dry finish.
"
1," they were both very enjoyable, but I preferred it cask conditioned.  A light copper colour with a malty and fruity nose, this came through to the taste.  On cask there was more of a slightly caramel aftertaste.  A very nice beer, more refreshing than a typical Scottish ale, good for the summer drink if you enjoy generally enjoy the darker beers.
"
1," Fruity with apples, pears, and banana with caramel malts.  Very sweet.  Some alcohol in the nose.	Appearance"
1," Thick lacing white and bubbly head.  Deep amber in colour.  Looks very appetizing.  Smells sweet and a bit yeasty.  Tastes a bit metallic at first followed by a fruity/raisony sting, spicy.  I not really getting what all of the rage is about.
"
1," The beer pours a deep amber with an off white head that is made up of tiny bubbles and is mostly lasting, the beer is full of tiny pieces of sediment. The nose is deep and a mix of fresh bread, roasted malt, slight hops, orange, lemon, stone fruit, spices, coriander, and cinnamon. The beer fills your mouth with carbonation and a light airiness. The front of the taste is a mix of sharp alcohol and sweet malts, the sides of the tongue really pick up the citrus notes and the back is a well balanced mix of malts and spice. The finish is sweet malts with fresh yeast and is mostly lasting.
"
1," 	50cl bottle at London Drinker. Yellowish colour with a thin head. Slightly malty aroma. Some wheat and metallic tones in the flavour but generally malty and typically German. Erm, yeah, its a German Pils.
"
1," Dark amber coloured. Nice beige head. Spicy aroma of primarily corriander. Flavour of caramel, ligth citrus and some alcahol burn. Not much aftertaste, but a decent beer though.
"
1," Thanks Matt.  The beer pours to a dark black/brown body with a brown/gray head.  The aroma is heavy on the coffee and oatmeal.  Also noticeable is chocolate.  The flavor is black patent and is very roasty with lots of coffee going on.  The palate is roasty and acedic.  I liked it.
"
1," Bottle.  Lemon, orange, grapefruit in the sweet nose.  Opaque cloudy amber body with strong carbonation and a tall, creamy, lacy beige head.  Lots and lots of sediment in the bottle.  Lightly hoppy.  Rubbery bitterness to start is grainy bitterness in the aftertaste.  Moderately sweet and bitter, this is the Mild of PAs, and about as good as a Pride & Joy.  Watery citrus the main flavor, light-bodied.  Nice and easy session beer.
"
1," Clear golden with a medium off white head. Malty aroma with hints of caramel and plums. Flavour had caramel, malt and hints of hops. Finished dry.
"
1," On tap at Siboire. Honey color with thin beige head. The taste is of hops and vegetables with a bit of malt.Not much of an afterteaste that lives you wanting more.
"
1," First taste 5/21/07.  Pours translucent and cloudy dark copper with a large head that quickly recedes and some lacing.  Aroma is not very strong.  Taste is somewhat metallic and sharp at first, but softens considerably as the beer warms.  Sweet yeast and malt are offset nicely by a decent amount of bitterness.  Not as impressive as the Bleue or the Blanche, but a fairly solid offering nonetheless.
"
1," sweet and dark, the alcohol comes forth but is not bruising in its impact - the malt helps to hide much of the bite. mouth-feel is chewy, with a nice coating ability. very nice to drink, with a light fruit finish.
"
1," Dark amber beer with a nice thick head. Yeasty and fruity aroma and taste of yeast, malt and alcohol. Very complex and interesting beer.

"
1," On draught during my Great Lakes area brew tour. Mahogany pour with a mild white head. Malty aroma of oak, caramel, grapes. More vanilla sweetness is prevelant than a dense caramel which may be commonly found in this style. There are oak, cola,  and sarsaparilla flavors here as well. No hop character to speak of. This finishes moderately sticky with a hint of cherries. I think this is a mild Scottish ale.
"
1," Thanks to Hellbilly for the hookup. Bottle pours brown with a khaki head.  Aroma shows notes of brown sugar, caramel, bourbon and toffee covered apples.  Flavor shows the same with additional notes of coffee and light roast.
"
1," Bouteille 750ml 2006. Couleur rouge-brun opaque et voile, belle mousse mais qui tombe. Arme fruit, pic et levure. Got sucr, lgrement pic, belle rondeur, effervescence amalgame les saveurs.

1," Tap.  Floral citrus hop aroma with yeast notes.  Pours copper, nut brown with a creamy tan head; creamy lacing.  Mild hop flavor with a creamy malt-yeast finish.  Medium bodied and creamy.
"
1," TheDM and Hotstuff vacation brew 11.  This draft brew was enjoyed at the Big River Brewery in Chattanooga Tennessee which was hosted by a pleasant accomodating staff.  This brew poured a small head of finely sized mostly lasting bubbles that left behind a good lace and an opaque black body with no visible carbonation.  It had a dark malt and coffee aroma.  The mouthfeel was initially smooth then finished with a slight hop bite.  It was an OK brew, but not a great one.
"
1," An amber beer with a huge beige head. The aroma is sweet with primary notes of caramel, while the flavor is lightly sweet with notes of caramel, leading to a bitter end.
"
1," DEC 28, 2011 Small bottle. Rusty brown body, good head. Hoppy aroma. Taste is initially sweet with caramel and prunes. Delicate and dry bitter finish. Very good but Bleue has even bigger taste.
"
1," Finally one of the Chimay familly! Got this one at a local market, was surprised to see it there lying in the shelf. Pours a very pretty copper-brown, with a beige foam. Goes for some fruit in the aroma, with strong malt character, along with spicy. Some honey to it as well. Fruity flavor, with spice notes, malt and also some wheat esters evidents, specially in the lightly bitter aftertaste. Also some grain going on. The whole experience goes along with a soft alcohol feel. Lightly dense palate, with light bitterness. Good. / Finalmente uma da famlia Chimay! Comprei num Carrefour, fiquei suspreso ao v-la na prateleira. Derrama um marrom acobreado muito bonito, com espuma bege. Tem algo frutoso no aroma, com carter forte de malte e especiarias. Algo de mel tambm no aroma. Sabor frutoso, com notas de especiarias e steres de trigo bem evidentes, especialmente no retrogosto. Algo de gros tambm acontecendo. A experincia toda  acompanhada por uma sensao leve do lcool. Densidade leve com leve amargor. Boa.
"
1," Poured from a 750mL bottle a deep brown with very large carbonation bubbles collecting on the side of a Chimay glass and is topped by a quick fading off white head. Aroma has an overall yeasty profile with some modest fruity esters in the middle and a light toasted malt presence at the tail end. Flavor starts off with a well balanced estery sweetness which transitions to a great toasted malty middle that has very light chocolate notes. Alcohol was a bit strong at the end of the tasting and added a bit of an uncharacteristically hot kick. The body is hefty but crisp with a modest amount of carbonation. Overall a fine brew. I think if the heat was a little less in this bottle it would of had a perfect blend of light toasted malt tones with a modest/strong yeast esteriness.
"
1," 750ml corked bottle. Poured a deep burgundy color with a large-bubbled head that was quite lasting. Murkiness in the appearance intensified as I reached the end. Aromas of bananas and pear with a hint of roastiness. Harsh scents of isopropyl alcohol as it warmed. Fruited flavors were overpowered by intense sweetness. A metallic feel at the finish.
"
1," 12 oz bottle. Pours cloudy at first and then clears to new copper penny with a nice fluffy white head. Huge citrus hop nose. Taste is a nice citrus hop profile with lingering bitterness on the end. Alcohol is present but not overwhelming.  Not much malt profile. A good drinking sessionable IPA.
"
1," Yeasty, fruity, malt. Flavor"
1," Pours a cloudy amber color with a ring of white foam. Nice aroma of malt, fruits and freshly cut grass. Good flavor of malt, fruits and grass. This is a very interesting dunkler bock.

1," JUN 13, 2008 11.20 Bottle"
1," Pours close to black with a brown / orange head.  The aroma has roasted malt with cream.  There are some coffee notes along with bits of char and some vanilla.  Medium body with light carbonation.  The flavor starts with a light citric taste, then comes the char and coffee along with some dark chocolate.  The finish has some spice and then the char slips back in and stay with you.  A decent oatmeal stout - not sure of the age, but this seems like it was a bit aged and would be quite nice fresh.
"
1," 0.33l bottle. Oaky body with fizzy dissipating head. Wheaty, resins, figs, dried fruit and banana leaves. Very pleasant medium carbonation. Sweet finish which lasts nicely.
"
1," 11.2 oz bottle.  Average light tan head that dissapates fairly quickly.  Reddish-orangish-brownish color.  Aroma is fruity with a touch of floral hops (actually much more but unable to dissern).  Good carbonation.  Fruit is present as well as bread in flavor.  I have been waiting on this one since I joined ""ratebeer"" a few months back.  I think this is the easiest drinking Belgian Strong Ale I have ever had.  Saying that it is complex and high quality.

1," GToMW 2007. Standard dark brown or black color with dark tan head. Roasted oats aroma. Sweet flavor. Pretty thin. More like a sweet porter to me.
"
1," Bottle. Great beige color head that was quite rocky and long lasting, with a hazy brownish red body. Apply and brown sugar aroma with notes of yeast, raisins, and bready notes. Creamy mouthfeel and tastes of plums, caramel, and a hint of cherry with just a hint of alcohol in the finish. great beer.
"
1," High carbonation.  Orange to amber in color with a big foamy head.  Yeasty, spicy, and sweet in the smell.  Much of the same from the smell is in the taste. Pretty good.
"
1," APR 24, 2007 Pint at the Seven Bridges Brewpub in Jacksonville.  Had this on the eve of their party to introduce it, with some of the proceeds going to charity.  This beer poured clear amber orange with a white head that soon dissipated.  It was an honest, straight-up beer.  Very drinkable, and very forgetable.  Nothing wrong with it, but nothing to make it special or memorable.   a good Irish Red, but boring.
"
1," Very cloudy medium brown with a smallish tan head.  A musty aroma that is not appealing.  Flavor is yeast and dark fruit, apple sauce caramel, and alcohol.  Very interesting and very good.
"
1," Growler supplied by StFun (Thanks!)  Dark black pour, a little carbonation and a very mellow coffee aroma.  Flavor was coffee, a little malt and a little hint of sweetness.  Finishes very light on the palate.  Overall a very decent coffee beer.
"
1," Obtained in trade with atpayne, thanks Adam!) Another massively overcarbonated bottle of beer that despite the careful pour has yielded more head than actual beer.  Also, the nose is fairly soapy, which often seems to go hand-in-hand with the massive carbonation.  Anyway, after several minutes, the foamy, light-tan has died down to only a quarter-inch, so I can finally proceed.  Well, the flavor is also moderately soapy, but its mild enough that I can overlook it and focus on the other flavors.  Mildly sweet, fruity, and lightly malty initially, the finish shows some mild but balancing bitterness, as well as a light smokiness.  It tastes okay, I guess, certainly nothing special, but of course, that soapiness cant be ignored either.  Unfortunately, I cant smell much beyond the soapiness, maybe some sweet fruitiness and some floral hops.  Body is about medium, and despite the huge head, carbonation on the palate isnt expansive at all.  Dark amber in color and fairly cloudy with some small, dark specks settling to the bottom of the glass.  The head never fades below a thin but complete layer, and there is a significant amount of foam left on the glass.  Not a great introduction to this brewery, but Im hopeful some of the others will be better.
"
1," A lightly smoked Vienna by billing, Ladder Truck probably refers to the building next door that burned down, hence the smoked malt.  Golden-amber.  Bright.  The aroma is smooth amber biscuity malts.  The palate is mostly biscuit, too, but with a touch of smoke.  A nice, easy-drinking light-bodied lager with lots of flavour.
"
1," Bottle Pours out a cloudy brown with some red topped with a off white head. Aroma of pit fruit and malts. Tast more of the fruit some yeast and roast malts.
"
1," Very little for aroma from this dark amber trappiste with a large head.  Flavor of yeast, flowers, hops, malt, spice.  Alcohol was noticeable and tingly to the palate but not on the finish.  A rather light flavor the was well balanced.

1," 75 cl bottle.  Trappist glass.  Pours a nice amber copper with a large tan head.  Decent lacing, head is short lived.  Aroma of fruit, yeast, malt and caramel.  Taste is smooth and creamy.  Flavors of fruit, caramel, yeast, spices and more.  Not much bitterness.  Well balanced.  Excellent !!
"
1," What oh what has happened at Chimay?  I first tried these beers in the Brugse Beertje in 1991 and liked them a lot.  The red, in particular, was strong and complex and I decided there and then that if this was Trappist beer I liked it.  However, recent tastings have left a bad taste in the mouth in more ways than one.  The colour is the same, but the aroma is wheaty and vegetal.  The body has vanished almost completely, with only a thin wheat, cardboard and chemically taste present, fading out quickly.  They say the recipe hasnt changed in years.  I dont believe them.  This beer is now unpleasant to drink.  Go and buy some Westvleteren instead.  (bottle in Trappiste, Altrincham)
"
1," This was poured into a trappist glass from bottle at an irish pub (in Ohio).  The nose was that of alcohol and raisen, very fruity, almost tuitty.  You can tell it was a fine beer because it relaxed me into a state of peacefulness.  Although it diffenitely could have been the atmosphere on this one, it was a fine setting.
"
1," Murky bad yellow with a medium white head.  Aroma of lemon, yeast, bready malt, sweet malt, mildly perfumed.  Taste of lemon, wheat, sweet malt, honey and mild spicy yeast.  Unobtrusive and average.
"
1," AUG 17, 2006 330 ml bottle.  Fizzy snap-crackle-pop when poured, quickly dissapating.  Sweet/sour apple smell is strong. Bitter apple finish.  Bottle Conditioned, which makes it a ""Real Ale.""
"
1," Wrzig herber Antrunk, in dem die vorhandenen Karamellnoten etwas unterdrckt wirken. Angenehme Malznoten, die schnell wieder verfliegen, sind im Mittelteil kurz der Hauptton, im Abgang leicht schokoladig und minimal suerlich.
"
1," Coppery brown, some red hints.  Light carmel malt aroma.  Tho thin, there was a decent caramelly malty mouth, maybe a touch of roasty nuts, and a clean finish.
"
1," Beige creamy, soft and fully lasting head. Dark amber-mahogony color. Aroma is fruity and slightly spicy. Flavour is fruity too but more balanced with a slightly bitterness that appears also in the long and mellow finish. Medium to full bodied. I tasted it near the Abbey de Scourmont, Belgium.
"
1,"  when poured into a trappist glass this beer is beutiful, thick and creamy tan head that is chunky in texture, brown hazy fluid underneath.  a nose of bready earth with some spiciness to it.  malty flavor with yeast inbeded bread taste and clove toffee feel.  well balanced on the palate and easy to drink. more 'gulpable' then most in this class. no alcohol taste at all.  i enjoyed this beer, because of its drinkability. most in this class you sip slowly. i suppose the bleu is a bit more robust higher alcohol and a more 'sipable' beer.  want some, get some....trappist beers that is!
"
1," MAY 20, 2010 Pours a ruby red brew with a hint of brown. Big bubbles in the foam, and big bubbles settle on the bottom of the glass. Im drinking it from a large win glass, since thats the closest thing I have to a trappist glass. This is also my first trappist beer. 	Taste reminds me of Leffe Blonde, a fruity bubblegumy aroma which glides into a mix of almonds, marzipan and ... hm, what is that other stuff? I dont know, but I like it! 	update 2010-05-20"
1," Very nice. Head is effervescent and smooth.  This is as nice, and perhaps smoother, thant he white.  Easy, simple, unassuming, powerful.  Not as flavorful as the white but still nice.
"
1," Bottle. Hazy golden with medium white head. Aroma is malt and wheat. Flavour is malt, wheat, sweet and a little citrus?
"
1," A golden ale with a thin white head. A light herbal hops aroma. In mouth, fresh mash with grainy quality, British hops. Medium bodied.Not bad. On tap at brewpub Dec. 30 2008.
"
1," Dark gold. Apples! Apples! Tart apples! Sweet and juicy. Freaking great. Love this style.
"
1," On tap at the brewpub.  I think this was being served from the beer engine.  Pour was dark amber with a good off white head.  The aroma and flavor are both very strong with citrus hops.  The flavor was even kind of gooey.  Medium body with an appropriate amount of carbonation.  Dry finish.  Really a nice beer.
"
1," [500ml bottle, Hebridean Brewery] Brownish in colour, rather than ruby as advertised. Thin head from the bottle. Aromas of malt and orange peel, some sweetness. Almost wheaty flavours at first, before the malts take over. The finish is quite thin and the beer becomes a bit watery at the end, which is unfortunate [15042009]
"
1," 750ml bottle, 08 vintage, courtesy of Swolf3, thank you Steven. Dark brown pour with a nice white head. Sweet candy aroma, dried fruit (raisins), very nice. Very smoth, creamy mouthfeel. The taste is slightly sweet with more dark dried fruit, very tasty, very happy to have this again, been along time.
"
1," A decent example of the style. Has some grass and dirt in the aroma. The taste was surprisingly hoppy and very refreshing. My first from this partcular brewer. Nice.
"
1," Not my favorite Chimay.  It starts more bitter than I like, and the taste is woody and reminiscent of rootbeer.  I do like the fruitiness, and the bitter finish doesnt linger, at least.  Overall not bad, just not my favorite Belgian.  If I had started my Chimay experience with this one, it might have stopped with this one as well, and I would have missed out on Bleu.
"
1," Orangey gold and slightly opaque, with a vibrant bubbly white head that quickly recedes to a gentle ring, but leaves lots of lacing.		Aroma"
1," can from the brewery consumed in the woods somewhere in colorado 7/19/10.		dark rich copper tinted amber color with a small off white head. 		it smells like peaches, oranges, mild peppery spiciness and some sweet caramel-y malt.		the flavor is malt forward (but not sweet) with notes of orange, a ton of peach-ness (especially in the aftertaste), earthy spice and a slightly bitter herbaceous finish.		it is on the fuller side of medium bodied with soft slick low carbonation.	bitchin diy packaging gets props! 6/4/6/3/13/3.2
"
1,"  I honestly have never had a beer smell the way this did.  It wasnt bad it was just different.  Alcohol, Cherry, Cinnamon, Rotten Eggs,  with a hint of Wood.Appearence"
1," Pours redish brown with an evergrowing tan head that eventually settles to a very creamy looking head.  There is an aroma of sweet malt and a faint hint of alcohol.  Its a bit spicy or herbed and has a full sweet taste. Full bodied feel rounds out a very nice beer.
"
1," DEC 5, 2006 Complex and tasty.  The alcohol content doesnt overwhelm the beer.  Sublime.	edit"
0," DEC 22, 2007 Murky brown beer with a weak head. Aroma is completely overtaken by strong diacetyl character, which comes through in the flavor as well. Avoid this beer! Another example of an obviously infected beer from this poor brewpub.
"
1," Bottle from Mane LIquor. Pours a dark amber with a big, frothy beige head. Has a sweet yeasty aroma with the presence of dark fruits and brown sugar. The taste brings out a lot of the dark fruits and brown candy-like sugar flavours. Hints of chocolate, raisins and yeast play a big part in the complexity of this one. Very enjoyable beer
"
1," A deep dark stout with a thick moka head. A pleasant sweet chocolate aroma with light vanilla notes. In mouth, a good sweet chocolate, coffee and light berry notes. Light to medium bodied. On tap at brewpub Dec. 30 2008.
"
1," Bottled. An unclear brown beer with a thick light orange head. The aroma is sweet with an acidic edge and primary notes of wheat, but also light notes of oranges. The flavor is sweet malty and rather wheaty combined with light notes of caramel, leading to a dry bitter finish combined with a slightly acidic wheaty note.
"
1," Very good beer. Pours a dark brown. High alcohol content does not overwhelm, and is balanced nicely with flavor.
"
1," The aroma is tannins, bourbon and chocolate. The flavor is oats, tannins, wood and a little smoke. Very light on the tongue. Sweet, yet ends on a slightly dry note.
"
1,"	This is one of our old favourites - something we havent had for quite a while. Trying it recently reminded us that its a great beer. Good hearty trappist nose and flavour. Smooth and full-bodied. Complex and slightly sweet.
"
1," A beautiful brown color with a brownish foam. A nice aroma. An excellent sweet and spicy taste, with a nice almost bitter aftertaste.
"
1," Bottle 50cl.Clear light to medium yellow color with a average, frothy to creamy, good lacing, mostly - fully lasting, white head. Aroma is moderate malty, grain, hay, light to moderate hoppy, dry grass. Flavor is moderate sweet and bitter with a average to long duration. Body is medium, texture is oily to watery, carbonation is soft. [20090625]
"
1," Pint at brewery Aug 21, 2006 - Aroma is wet bread dough, lemon, and hickory/maple that make for an interesting combo. Pours light brown with a small head and decent lacing. Flavor is citrus, yeast, and spice. The syrup used is apparent giving this typical farmhouse ale a smokey twist. Palate is tart and creamy. An interesting and different take on a farmhouse ale that works well.
"
1," Misty brown,weak head,good carbon.Aroma,malt,nuttiness,vanilla,wheat grainy.Flavour bright citrus,tangy,grain,sweet sure it,s wheat,very pleasant.Finish bitter sweet,makes you want more,citric swet finish a lovely ale.
"
1," Bouteille 33cl. La Chimay ""brune"" est en fait ambre et assez classique. Un gout acidul reste en bouche et doit provenir de la levure sachant que cette bire ne contient pas de bl. Un peu du par le corps, lalcool est trs peu prsent, bire relativement sche finalement pour le style. Belle couleur et belle mousse.
"
1," Bought a gift pack tonight with the red,white and blue Chimay along with the big chimay glass for $10.99.	Bottle pored a dark caramel color with a medium white head.	Good fruity crisp aroma.	Flavor of malt and hints of alcohol with a 	medium body.	Not bad , maybe a bit to sweet. I think that the white is best.
"
1," Rich dark colour, powerful taste, perhaps a bit too sweet, nevertheless well worth a try.
"
1," MAY 7, 2003 Yeasty aroma, cookie dough flavor. I'm not picking up much bitterness, just a little. Maybe I've been drinking too much IPA. Malty with excellent mouth feel. Can't really taste the alcohol at all. Overall a fine beer.
"
1," This is the beer that opened my eyes. Perhaps the perfect gateway. Wonderful taste, aroma, and appearance. I cant say enough about it!
"
1," Starts off with a skunky aroma, mellows a bit as it warms. Has a quickly fading soap sud like head. Decent golden color. Flavor - a bit metallic - some muted malty notes coming through - but altogether bland. Reminds me of the taste of milk after brushing your teeth. Quite forgetable.
"
1," (bottle) Pours dark brown/black with a thin tan head.  Aroma has a vinous quality to it which is most similar to port, but this scent is at its strongest when the beer is still.  When swirled, plenty of the roasted malt and booze rise to the forefront.  Aroma gets considerably sweeter with warming.  Taste contains similar components as the aroma, and the wine is more present here, although tasting it yields more of a dry red wine quality, rather than the sweet port present in the aroma.  Good amount of oak.  Roasted malt is present as well with some lighter dark fruit and maybe some dark chocolate.  Finish has a lingering amount of roasted malt with some hop bitterness.  Finish is a little rough actually, as the booze, bitterness, and roast coalesce into astringency.  Mouthfeel is medium to full with a touch too much carbonation.  Overall, this is a decent beer from Lucky Bucket, and Il certainly try others from this brewery.
"
1," a good beer but somewhat difficult to palate. most beer drinkers would appreciate it but a little to awkward in taste for me.
"
1," On tap in Nashville.  Cloudy orange color.  It had a sour citrusy and mildly orange flavor that was somewhat gritty.  There was a lingering metallic aftertaste.
"
1," Draft. Dark amber color with a medium white head that diminished slowly. Aroma was complex hops and a roasted tone. Flavor was medium hops and malt with medium sweet finish with a small citrus tone. Very drinkable.
"
1," Poured from big bottle.  Aroma of sweet malt and a bit of alcohol.  A beautiful mahogany with tan head.  I taste vanilla, cake, banana, caramel, and a trace of cocoa.  The 9% alc was hardly noticable.  This stuff is SO drinkable.  Finish is just as great as the start.  This one goes in my hall of fame for sure.
"
1," Orange pour with a white head. Some hops in the aroma but faint. Very light.
"
1," Sampled with Beerdrenched.  Pours hazy orange / bronze with a smallish eggshell white head.  The aroma has lots of floral / grapefruit hops - not too much more to the aroma, but the hops are great.  Medium body with some soft carbonation.  Taste has woody / pine hops with enough caramel malt to lightly balance out.  The finish has dry woodiness.  Very enjoyable IPA.
"
1," Very nice appearance and smell. Taste of dry fruits and light yeasty aroma. Powerful and very delicate complexity. The best beer in the Chimay portfolio.
"
1," Bottle. Amber coloured with no head. Breadish and malty. Also with hints of caramel and a very slightly bitterness.
"
1," a nice short bottle enjoyed in my chimay glass. Perfect red and orange color and thin head resting in a wide brimmed glass. The aroma was sweet and yeasty. Sort of dried apricot and white peach along with a little spice and bread from the yeast esters. Such a silky mouth feel along with the sweetness makes ones feel as if he is drinking a perfume. Ends in a slightest bitter finish.
"
1, Irish Red	Brewery
1," Overall a very good beer, but not a flavorfull as some other Trappist Ales Ive had before.  There is almost no aftertaste when you drink it.  I had bought this and Fin Du Monde also, and actually enjoyed the Fin Du Monde better.  This is still a very good beer and will probably buy again.
"
1," Brown color with plenty of off-white head.  Chocolate malt aroma.  Chocolate and roasted malt flavor.
"
1," 12oz bottle from Orland Park Binnys single rack. Pours very dark brown with thick dark tan head. Aroma is oats, roasted malt and chocolate. Flavor is mostly roasted malts and oats with some chocolate and finishes with some coffee bitterness. Medium mouthfeel and properly carbonated. Decent stout. Would be better with less coffee in my opinion.
"
1," Light amber color and the head laces nicely. There is low hops. I read the name and didn't realize that the Imperial was part of the name of the beer and not the name of the style so I was expecting a big hoppy IPA. This isn't an IPA like I was expecting but more of an English-style pale ale. Sweet with a nice caramel maltiness. Not a bad session beer.
"
1," Poured into a Chimay trappist glass which really released the fruity aroma. Nice banana and raisin smell. Not as strong in alcohol as the blue but a very nice beer nonetheless. However, I wouldnt recommend having more than a couple.
"
1," This beer pours a golden yellow with a thin white head.  The aromas are skunk, yeast.  The mouthfeel  is dry, bitter and sticky.  Cheers!
"
1," MAR 20, 2010 Pours a dark brown colour, hazy, with a small dissipating head. The aroma is of caramel malts, fruits; raisins and prunes, and some yeast. The taste is sweet but not overpowering and has a little spice to it as well. Medium-full body, lively carbonation and somewhat slick on the palate. Overall a very enjoyable beer to drink.
"
1," thanks to BB63	dark brownish pour with a HUUUUGE frothy tan head.	Smells potentailly infected, some light chocolate notes hints of lactose, & an odd lightly sour citrus aroma I cant identify w/ hints of old bandaid..  Pal is lightly creamy avg palate. Very buttery flavor ultra light bourbon notes some woody pieces hints of lactose.  Not to hot.
"
1," Bottled Clear deep golden, airy head. Light butterscotchy nose. Sweet and medium bodied with rounded mouthfeel. Some butter, low on hops, low bitterness. Anonymous.
"
1," On tap at Big River Grille, Nashville.  Pours near black in colour, good head and lacing. Aroma and flavour of roasted malt, some hop presence, but not sweet, in my opinion.  Nice stout.
"
1," Pours with an amber body topped by a medium thick head with some lacing.  Its slighlty sweet and malty but bitter and hoppy with a nice piney note.  Medium bodied, smooth and a touch dry.
"
1," Bottle... poured a dark ruby color with a frothy white head. Roasted malt aroma which was almost wine like.  And a very fizzy , full palate. Tastes of sweet malt and alcohol with other fruity flavors. Finished smooth and short.
"
1," Bottle 35,5 cl. Courtesy of KimJohansen. Pours black and opaque with a small light brown head. Burned malty aroma with a little vanilla and wood. Medium body with hard roasted malts, vanilla and oak. Malt bitter finish. 270509
"
1," Wonderful fruity aroma.  Pours a dark amber, with a very nice tan head.  Taste is banana, but with a much deeper body.  Turns a bit sweet to end.  I dont usually like strong ales, but this one is nice.
"
1," Probably my least favorite in the Chimay line-up but still a great beer. Appearance is a nice darker brown color with floaties present, it looks quite good. Typical Belgian esters pull through with a good spice bite to it, but this one is just not as complex as other dubbels... a little bit average but when youre talkin Belgian beers average is still very good!
"
1," Bottle. Great beige color head that was quite rocky and long lasting, with a hazy brownish purple body. Molasses  and brown sugar aroma with notes of yeast, raisins, and bready notes. Creamy mouthfeel and tastes of sweet caramel, and a bit of cherry with just a hint of alcohol in the finish. Great beer.
"
1," Red/brown in color with a large tan head. Aroma of dark fruits and malt.	Slightly sweet malt flavor at first, then gives way to a dry somewhat bitter finish. Classic.
"
1," Nice copper color with a full head. Spicy taste, I can feel the alcohol content in this one.
"
1," 750ml bottle poured into a trappist glass produced a thin, tan head with dark red body.  Aroma of white grapes.  Taste of grapes and other fruits and spices.  One of my favorites and right up there with Rochefort and Westvletern.
"
1," Lovely dark copper with a tan head.  Great apricot, yeast and spice aromas.  Taste again notes the apricots, the bready hints and just a fantastic palate and texture.  If this is the bronze medal of Chimay beers, I am most eagerly awaiting the Silver and Gold!  A wonderful brew.
"
1," 750ml bottle poured into a goblet. Red/brown and cloudy with small disappearing head. Aroma is raisins, spice, plum, citrus, malt. Very lively and complex taste, and sweetness and bitterness is beautifully balanced. A delightful beer, and available easily here in Ontario. Now if only some of the other trappist offerings were this easy to get!
"
1," I had my first (only and last) glass of this on the way to Savanah, GA for St. Patricks this year.  I found the flavour of the beer totally overpowered with an alcohol taste.  Same with the aroma.
"
1," The Dan Journal #78.  Tasted 4/5/2007.  12oz bottle.  Soggy bready soapy nose.  Notes of citrus.  Decent malt backbone.  Nice cocoa malt note.  Nice balance.  Touch soapy, but its a session.  Should be kept closer to cold.  Keeps the bitter bite.  Bold citrus finish.
"
1," A copper color with a moderate sized white head. The aroma is faint and malty. Some caramel and nutty flavors can be noted if you focus hard enough. A little watery and nothing inspiring.
"
1," Nice, dark brown brew with a slightly yeasty taste to it. You can easily smell the aroma hops from this, but it tastes quite bready. A nice beer to have sitting on the porch waiting the sky for whatever, its not too strong and certainly can compliment the senses.
"
1," JUN 26, 2006 This is the forth offering I have had from Barley Island and I must say really enjoyed this beer. Color wa dark amber with a off-white head. Aroma was that of carmel and fruit. This was a very smooth beer with no overpowering flavor. Very smooth, flavorful and easy to drink.
"
1," Bottle.	Hazy yellow coloured with a medium sized white ehad.	Fruity aroma of malts and grain with perfumed notes of yeast.	Fruity flavour of malts and hay with notes of hops and yeast.	Hoppy finish.
"
1," wow!  hazy brown with tons of chunks floating in it.  smells of dark fruit.  taste is amazing for the high alcohol content.  good sharp carbonation.  flavor of grapes, pears, plums, malt.  may have a hint of ginger or some other undetectable spice.
"
1," 33cl bottle from 2009, with a cheese platter at Ortega Fish Shack.  The yeasty, caramel, figgy, port-like, slightly sweet and warming alcohol combination made this the perfect complement to an unpasteurised Normandy camembert.  The richness and complexity are akin to fine wines or vintage ports but this is all beer, no vinous character or quality to it.
"
1," You guys know what this is about.  Knocks your socks off.  Had this as my 100th beer at Clancys in Bloomsburg, PA.
"
1," I was expecting this not to be too good.  I figured this was some rooty-tooty beerthat snobs enjoyed.  I was wrong.  What a great beer.
"
1," Bottled. A golden beer with a thin white head. The aroma is sweet malty combined with notes of brewing mash and sulphur - making it quite fresh. The flavor is sweet with notes of straw and malt as well as lighter notes of brewmash and sulphur, leading to a dry bitter finish where the note of straw lingers. Thanks MiP for sharing.
"
1," 12oz. bottle.  Opaque black with a small light brown head.  Heavy coffee aroma, with tinges of chocolate.  Heavy coffee character dominates the flavor, some astringent roastiness and dark chocolate.  Residual roast malt finish with a slight huskiness.  Mouthfeel is light, somewhat thin.
"
1," Aroma of prunes, raisins and dates with a fresh pine hint.  Nice frothy head.  the flavor begins with grapefruit, lemon and light plum which turns into a deep thick pudding of raisins.  Very clean and refreshing finish.
"
1," DEC 10, 2010 08/04/2008 Pours a very dark brown with a thick tan head.  The aroma is very yeasty and malty with a ripen fruit hint to it.  The taste is malty and chocolatey with some sort of roasted nut flavor.  The finish is sweet, almost as if there is a bit of vanilla in it.  This is a great beer.  4.7		Re-rate 12/10/2010"
1," On tap. Clear & coppery with a big lasting head. Ok carbonation. This beer has a nice hop aroma. However, the hop flavor is muted in comparison. Malt has a very mild sweetness and gives this beer a body that is on the light side of medium. Dead Frog has created a beer that will offend nobody, but lacks boldness. Craft beer for the mainstream.
"
1," I getting fond of beers served in goblets! Beautiful!
"
1," a classic dubbel... the dominant flavor is the Belgian yeast. other flavors like fruits and nuts are quite mellow.  a smooth well balanced brew
"
1," Didnt care for the first one, but the drinkablity was actually quite high.  Good quality brew.  A little on the malty side.
"
1," It took me a while to get around to it. Its my first Belgian Strong Ale. I guess its pretty good, but its not my style. I will have to try it again some time.
"
1," Pours a cloudy light brown with a nice sized head. Malty aroma but not all that malty when tasted. Smooth and medium bodied.
"
1," I am more disappointed than I can say. I had heard so much about Chimay (red or blue label) and expected far more than I received. Almost no bitterness with a strangely sour sweet flavor. Colors decent (though minimal head), but flavor leaves much to be desired for a trappist beer. Almost watery mouthfeel. Wtf, guys?
"
1," Pours a hazy red brown with a short-lived head. Aromas are very fruity. Taste is mainly of fruits like banana, figs, apples etc and some nice sweet malt presence. An easy drinking and pleasant Belgian, not overly sweet or strong in flavour.
"
1," A very complete beer.  The beer is very cloudy, and the head is huge, and takes a while to go down.  The flavor is very good, with a rich array of fruits.  The beer was very clean, and left no bad aftertaste.  I highly recommend this beer.
"
1," Truly bizarre and tea-like.  I love Dunkels, but this Kotayk is just plain weird.  Almost flat, with loads and loads of chocolatey malt flavor.  Some caramel malt.  A tad thin, all the same.  How they got it to be malty yet thin I dont know.  Theres the slightest hint of tea-like bitterness - not unlike a cup of Earl Grey tea.
"
1," Nope, sorry. Still favor the white.This is overly sugary and detracts from the aromaic hights in the red and white. Make no mistake, a great beer. Just less outstanding than the golden ale.
"
1," beautiful red color full flavors and widely available! Great beer. Taste this.
"
1," SEP 6, 2006 Bottle"
1," Brown in color with a large beige head. Aroma is of prune, flowers and malt. Taste is of chocolate, malt, yeast and light flower notes.
"
1," Pours a light gold with a thin white head. No lacing. Light hops aroma. Light bodied, with the typical brewpub ""light lager"" taste. Minimal hops flavor and somewhat fizzy. Light and crisp finish. Okay for what it is.
"
1," DEC 10, 2010 750-ml bottle Marcellos Lafayette, LA - Aroma"
1," Bottle. Poured a reddish brown with a small fading white head. Aromas are caramel and raisins. Taste is a smooth one, some fruit and a light bitterness.
"
1," Well, the (un)official beer of the Raiders. Had it on Superbowl sunday. I was bit surprised that they have it in clear bottles, definately reason for the little skunky smell. Anyhow pours in golden and clear with a decent white head. Very heavy carbonation a bit watered down taste. Ok but nothing I'd buy again
"
1," Looks, smells, and tastes like a well crafted Belgian Strong. It is. Much more comment worthy is its drinkability. Smoothe, balanced, deep without being complicated. One of the best. Please enjoy.
"
1," Deep amber-red colour.  Buttery malt aroma and initial flavour to match.  Then some bitter hops leading to a dry finish.
"
1," Typical grassy, bready lager, but doesnt really work for me. First sip OK, but goes downhill fast. The finish is watery and sour.
"
1," NOV 24, 2003 Hazy amber-brown color, thick foamy head that eventually settles down. Yeasty aroma, lightly spiced taste. I expected a little more out of this, but it was still quite good.
"
1," 11.2 oz. bottle courtesy of agl108.  Pours a murky amber color with a thick tan head and plenty of floaties.  A subtle aroma of candied sugar, burnt toffee, and dark fruits.  Goes down medium-bodied, fairly bubbly, and definitely on the sticky side.  Taste-wise there is some candied sugar and a plummy flavor upfront.  Burnt toffee flavors follow.  Finishes with a yeasty bite.  Spiciness is evident throughout.  Ok, but I dont really see what all the fuss is about.
"
1," Sampled at the 8th Annual Music City Brewers Festival.  Red orange, cream colored head.  Aroma is toasty, caramel.  Taste is the same toasted malt, sweet caramelized corn cereal.
"
1," JUN 22, 2005 11.2 oz bottle, approx 3 years old"
1," Nashville.  Lord, help us.  Transparent, magnifying copper in color with the slightest accent of red.  First aromatic deviation of the night.  Sweet honeyed bread with a simcoe-esque bitter-sweet sensation.  Spicy toffee flavor might be a stretch, but the special effort is appreciated and noted.  Weak, hopped water.  Dammit.  Takes on a trait of werthers originals sitting in a dog water dish for a year plus.  Putrid copper pennies that made their way into the flower planter come through in the finish.
"
1," woodsy, sharp, piney, grapefruity with the foresty touch that I often pick in the Chinook varietal. Unfortunately, it is not my favourite hop profile, but it is certainly well integrated. The pale malts underneath are a mix between bread and biscuit in there flavour development. Limited crystal proportion makes it dry and refreshing rather than sweet and clashing. Fresh and crafty IPA.
"
1," Amber with a lasting creamy head. Unremarkable, but pleasant nose of citrus, caramel and a hint of resin. Flavor is orange, caramel, and light pine. Light-medium body is drinkably watery, dryish, and has a nice, smoothly-rough-smooth carbonation.
"
1," Bottle.  Grapefruit and orange aroma, lots of hops with a strong apparent bitterness to match the tang.  Floral aromatic hops.  Clear orange-amber pour with a thick creamy beige head.  Bitter and bone-dry, on the resiny side of the hopcoin, yet not really oily.  Grapefruit and citrus, indeed, but light caramel, too.   Aftertaste is a mix of hops and drying darjeeling.  Medium-light body is smooth and very quaffable.  A little too straightforward, but still pretty nice.  This could be divisive, and I on the favoring side.
"
1," Red/brown colour, off white head. Aroma of dark fruits, caramel. Taste is quite sweet, dark fruits, and it has a metallic touch that I dislike. Nice bitter finish. Dry mouthfeel. Not the best of dubbels by far.
"
1," Wonderfully rich and well balanced.  Nice fruity nose, sweet candy flavor.  Slightly cloying though.
"
1," Bottle from t Brugs Beertje.  Very nice beer.  Dark brown with a good head.  Like other strong Belgian beers it hides its alcohol very well.  When compared to the other Trappists I prefer Rochefort, but still very good.
"
1," deep caramel brown pour with bubbly white head and pleasent yeasty raisin aroma. light fruits, raisin, heavy yeast and roasty malts. very easy drinking for the style. the alcohol is very well hidden. awesome beer.
"
1," Nice aroma.  Poured a clear amber a little dark for a pale ale.  Nice malt and hop taste.  An enjoyable beer.

1," Bottle from 2005. Rocky, amber colored head. Oily, cloudy body. Smell is very nice with chocolate and dark fruit. Aromas of chocolate and nuts. Taste is rather sweet and slightly bitter. Palate to me is a bit disappointing, aftertaste is a bit watery and too short to my liking..
"
1," Pours a medium dark ruby brown.  Foams upon opening, but head dissipates quickly once in a glass.  Feels nice in the mouth, and the taste is even throughout (slight bitterness which is offset by sweetness and caramel flavors).  Not as complex as I expected, but it is a very welcoming beer.  I look forward to trying the other two Chimay brews for comparison.
"
1," I couldnt tell a big difference between the regular and the oaked aged brew.  The oak age perhaps is a little more robust with and smooth with the flavor.  It is a solid oatmeal stout, but has a certain spice on the after taste.  Barely Island Java Stout is a lot better.
"
1," 12 ounce shorty bottle.  Lucky Bucket IPA is robust in color, moving from dark amber to red.  My initial impression of the nose is that it gives a pretty solid aroma of piney hops, though it fades quickly.  Moderate amount of lacing and about a half finger of foam.  Sticky lacing continues down the glass.  Theres a hefty amount of bitterness and a nice piney bitter finish.  Mouthfeel is pretty heavy,  but it could use more body.  Theres light cereal sweetness is up front, with grapefruit and citrus in the middle, followed by those piney hops..  Obviously, this is a pine bomb.  The beer could benefit from some more malt sweetness, but overall I like it.
"
1," Pours a light amber color with a foamy off-white head. The hoppy aroma is floral with grassy notes. Flavor is bitter from start to finish but is well balanced making this an enjoyable IPA.
"
1," Deep rusted copper, mildly bitter. Heavy earth notes.  Dried fruits, sweet spices, malty.
"
1," least impressive of the Chimays, heavy on dark red fruits & malts, some caramelised brown sugar, spice, minor spiced hops, middling, bit thin body
"
1," Good head on pour which settled doen to a 2mm coating after a couple of minutes. Dark orange/ brown translucent colour with visable yeast remnants (Couldnt wait to let it settle.) Enjoyable yeasty flavour with sweet suagry feel. Recommended as a winter slow drinking/ appreciating beer.
"
1," Bottle. Cloudy brown with small but persistent head. Some lacing. Well carbonated. Slight fruit aroma (plum, raisin). Not hoppy. Mouthfeel is excellent, this beer gently fizzes away. Slight taste of brown sugar and fruit. The 9% alcohol is masked very well.
"
1," 330 ml bottle. Hazy orange-brown colour, thick light brown head. Sweet aroma of dark fruits and alcohol. The flavour is malty and fruity, wioth alcohol warmth and mild bitterness in the finish. Medium-bodied, highly carbonated.
"
1," JUN 26, 2011 11.2 oz bottle. Tried this brew right after sampling the chimay blanche (white). This beer was very good...poured very dark, almost black and had a good aroma. It was smooth on the palate and a solid aftertaste. The 9% abv was very well hidden as well.
"
1," Bottle to snifter. Pours thin dark brown with a big soapy kahki head. Aroma is bitter dark fruit and roasted burnt malt. Taste is more burnt malt and dark fruit plums and soy. Palate is medium and very fizzy with a chaulky finish. For a strong porter I felt it was lacking creaminess and chocolate malt. Pretty bitter though!
"
1," Murky brown in colour, the head doesnt last long despite the steady bead of bubbles. There is an astringent edge which really spoils the palate for me. I find this thin and watery, the high alcohol therefore becomes harsh and unbalancing.I have tried this several times pre-ratebeer and enjoyed it, but this bottle was a big let down. May rerate at a later date.
"
1," (Bottle)  Pours a mahogany color with a medium long lasting head.  Complements a wide arange of meats, poultry, and spicy dishes.
"
1," Drank with friends who had never tried this variety.  They really appreciate its dark fruit, spice and malt flavor, commenting on how many different tastes were in one bottle.  There of course are many beers quite a bit more complex and I will enjoy sharing these with them as well.
"
1," 33 cl bottle. Served in Chimay goblet. Reddish bown w/ nice, tan head. Very pleasant and balanced in both aroma and flavor; dominated by malt and subdued spices. Easily drinkable.

"
1," Bouteille 33cl.	Orange avec une fine opacit, col blanc.	Arme de levure, sucr note malt et caramel, en arrire une note de pomme caramlise se fait sentir. 	En bouche, bire tenant un profile de levure, malt et cara avec au palais une amertume plus prononce donnant une note de citron. Sucre brun, fruits noirs allant vers prune ou date, mais aussi cette impression de pomme.
"
1," I dont drink too many Chimay beers, mostly around Christmas. However, I did get to try this one out for the first time recently. The taste is great, really fresh. Good head and nice appearance. This is a beer you just want to sip and enjoy. I really enjoyed it and Ill be getting more in the future.
"
1," 33cl bottle. Careful opening, overflows! Dark brown, white-beige head, stays.	Alcohol, rum, floral aroma.	Sour, slightly burnt taste bitter finish.	Can taste the alcohol.	Palate - smooth, thin, less carbonated than the red.	Feels heavy on the stomach.	Improves as it goes on, not my favourite.
"
1," Bottle has quite a cool lable on it. Aroma is heavily roasted near burnt malts. Taste is similar though a bit thin, bittering hops have a wee say also. Not bad, but needs more body.
"
1," medium golden, thick creamy light tan head. light citrus (orange and lemon) in the aroma. flavor is somewhat sweet, light to medium bodied, light orange hoppiness, light caramel flavors...decent enough.
"
1," Small bottle poured a clear reddish amber with a large lasting amber head. Aromas of carmel, fruittiness and light spice. Palate was light to medium bodied and crisp. Flavors of carmel, light fruit and a hint of spiciness with a crisp lingering malty finish.
"
1," MAR 9, 2010 (bottle) pours a hazy, ruby-amber colour with a tall, frothy off-white head. aroma of sweet spices, notably cinnamon and heavy clove, notes of bread and subtle hop spices, light alcohol, caramel. flavour of subtle dark fruits, grainy wheat, light sweet spices and alcohol. full body, with smooth carbonation and a warming, bitter finish.
"
1," AUG 26, 2008 12oz bottle. pours very dark brown, nice airy head that dissipates quickly, but sticks around throughout. Most notable qualities of this beer are"
1," Maroon colored with light tan head.  Aroma of sweet malt and caramel.  Some dark fruit lurking in the background with a slight bitter balance.
"
1," A hazy amber beer with a light orange head. The aroma is malty and slightly spicy, while the flavor is a clean malty one, with an OK hoppy bitter finish.
"
1," Verre de 10 oz, au Siboire, version Citra. Trs beau nez de houblon rappelant les fruits tropicaux et les fleurs. Robe ambre et lgrement trouble, petite dentelle et effervescence assez faible. Assez mince en bouche, de douces crales caramlises supportent le houblon fruit, moyennement aromatique. Texture lgrement aqueuse. Finale assez sche, prsentant une amertume rsineuse dintensit moyenne.  Une bire intressant et facile  boire.
"
1," 330 ml botlle. hazy amber colour. creme head. subtle caramel taste wich stays with U
"
1," Draft, light copper.  I got a malty aroma on this.  Beer was thin but malty, and hints of subdued spicy hops.  Slightly bitter finish, and decent mouthfeel.  I felt this was one of their better beers I had, behind the stout and IPA.
"
1," The first Trappiste Ive ever tried a few years ago. I drink Chimay Blue often. Very well balanced flavour. Must be enjoyed out of a Trappiste chalice. Glad to see its more readily available now than in the past. I regret not getting a 75cl bottle when I was in Belgium.
"
1," Mahogany body, small tan head.  Flavor is malty and fruity.  Adjuncts or not, this is a great tasting brew.
"
1," Hazy brown colour with a big off-white head.	Spicy aroma with lots of yeast.	Complex spicy flavour with sweetness and yeast.
"
1," Dark, dark brown, almost inky-slow pour with a slow-forming and long lasting cookie-brown head. Dark roast coffee in the nose with bittersweet chocolate and vanilla ice cream. Dark chocolate flavor with a coffee bitterness in the finish. Full-bodied, but not chokingly-so. Quite good, and it made a really nice treat after a really crappy day. ~~~~~~~~~ Cellared two years. Purchased May 2007 from Corkscrew, Urbana, IL, consumed June 2009.
"
1," From The tap poured amber with a fair amount of head.  Decent flavor with a quick finish.
"
1," NOV 12, 2011 Re-review seeing as Ive got my hands on the Grand Reserve 75 cL bottle from ABS Drinks in Winksele - which allegedly matures better in the bottle than the 33 cL version.  Dark red with a bubbly head that becomes fine and creamy as it collapses.  The aroma is sweet, rich and deep.  Sweet and a little fruity, spiced with alcohol bite and a bitter aftertaste.
"
1," JAN 10, 2006 75 CL bottle. Bbrown with a small fast diaperaring head. Mild aroma of fruit and flowers. Flavor of malt. Bitter semi alcoholic aftertaste.  A bit over-rated.
"
1," Really strong opening numbers - rocking with the deep amber and froth of lace - violins blazing with the aromatic expression of caramel, yeats, and so many musical hints of fruits and spices.  Some of that in the heart of the set, too, especially esters and flowery hops to counterpoint the malt, but things start to fade, the band gets sloppy, the director takes a break and substance fades in favor of trailing ditties.
"
1," JUN 22, 2005 Tap - smokey malt and banana aroma.  Dark tan cloudy color.  Smooth tasting mix of banana, clove and slightly smokey malt (not as much as the aroma would lead you to believe) with no bitterness.  A great tasting and smooth weizen bock.  Brewery is definitely worth a visit.
"
1," Pours a deep mahogany into the glass with plenty of off white head.  Aroma is fruity and nutty.  The taste is much of the same and the mouthfeel is unbelievable!  A great dubbel!
"
1," Brown colored with a big foamy nice head.  Smells are sweet, spiced, fruity, some alcohol.  Taste is sweet, malty, alcohol, and complex.  Good beer.
"
1,"  This one pours a dark opaque brown.  There was a fair amount of a tan head on it, although it didnt leave much lacing.  The aroma was OK.  It was mainly roasty coffee with some chocolate notes.  It is a medium bodied brew.  The flavor mainly roasted coffee notes.  Some dryness and earthiness also.  Neither sweet nor bitter.  A decent porter.
"
1," Heavily metallic aroma, plus sweaty mittens, molasses, and cream.  Slightly fruity.  Smoky molasses and alcohol flavor.  Slightly hot finish but a residual sweetness lingers.  Seemed to lack complexity; Il try it again.
"
1," Badgers Hill is a garden centre / orchard in Chilham, a small village between Canterbury and Ashford in Kent. My folks happen to live in Chilham, so I think its my duty to be the first reviewer of their cider. Its sold from the barrel in 2 pint milk cartons at 4.25. In the glass its very pale, with very little carbonation. Its 8% abv, and this is well disguised. The taste is of apples and a slight peachyness. Quite sweet, mellowing out in the finish. Its a young cider and lacks body - it could do with a ageing before its sold. That said its very fruity and refreshing and Ill be buying it again. They also do a sweet and a medium dry. The shop is open every day between March and September.
"
1," On tap at Chattanooga location. A hazy pale color in the glass with a thin white head. Mainly clove in the aroma with wheat and hints of banana. The flavor found a nice mix of banana, clove, and orange. Light body. Left me look forward to more summer brew on the horizon.
"
1," After uncorking the bottle and hearing this wonderful champagne pop, and after the smoke clears, I pour into the glass a beautiful dark appearance with a touch of red, a pronounced head, complex caramel, malted flavors, and while this beer has a fine and wonderful texture, it looks better than it tastes, theres a kind of fruited dullness, even the aroma is bitter, perhaps sour is the word Im looking for, as if they mixed a little Orval into the dark Belgian Ale.  Personally, while I loved the look, and while I gave it every kind of temperature test, I didnt care for the taste.  Perhaps I got a bad bottle, or perhaps this is really what it tastes like.  Unfortunately, Im inclined to believe the latter.
"
1," A nice warm copper color with a cream-white head of fine soft sparkly bubbles. Head thins after the initial pour, but a layer of froth lingers nicely. Pleasant clean earthy smells. Some flowery hops. Toasted sugar. As it warms, some candied oranges in there too. Body is smooth and lingers in the mouth long enough to be satisfying, but without cloying. Tastes of carmel and gentle fruit esters.
"
1," Fairly clear dark brown with a lackluster, white head.  Aromas of cinnamon and cloves along with some malt and a tiny bit of hops.  Body is average.  Flavors of malt, chocolate, some roastiness and a clean, mildly bitter finish.  Not too shabby.
"
1,"  medium bodied. Clean with solid malt orientation. Slightly nutty at finish. Refreshing beer.
"
1," Large head, dark color, offered an aroma of port, smoke, and an average alcohol taste.  Went very well with pork served with carmalized onions.
"
1," Draught at the Hamilton Place location. Pours a burnt sienna brown with small khaki head. The aroma is toasty with a slight hint of caramel, even a touch of cocoa, a slight earthy note, slight dried cranberry, and a bit of toffee. The flavor is toast, a hint of charred wood, a hint of toffee. Not as sweet as the aroma would have me believe. There are some earthy notes and some odd fruity hoppiness that comes across kinda like strawberry. Ok session beer.
"
1," Typical light beer pale gold with a small white head that leaves a bit of lacing. The aroma is faint grains. The flavor is grainy but watery. Better than most light beers.
"
1," Bottle. Orange colour with a small white head. Honey, fruity aroma and taste, sweet. Medium body and a sweet finish.
"
1," Bomber shared with muenster and NachlamSie. Pours black with amber extremities and a big tan head. The aroma is coffee, raisins, whisky, and hints of alcohol, caramel, and toffee. The flavor is dominated by interesting coffee notes, with some distant bitter chocolate. Some smoky bourbon notes come out once in a while, but not too often (as seems to frequently be the case with barrel aged stuff). The aftertaste is quite warm. Grainy oat flavor is apparent at times, too, though not as smoothly as other oatmeal stouts. Pretty good in all.
"
1," nice temp nice head nice bouquet a bit raisiny tasting and prune. A little of an alcohol taste.
"
1," This Chimay is similar to Chimays red label Premiere with a more pronounced alcohol taste. It definitely has a nice caramel aftertaste and is outstanding overall.
"
0," Tasted as part of a sampler at Big Riverss Fla location....huge taste of diacetyl, truly unpalatable. I hope this was just a bad batch, as the other beers in the sampler were at least ""OK""
"
1," Bottle. Hazy brown/red body with off-white head. Flavour is malt, sweet, caramel, yeast and dark fruit.
"
1," 750ml cork top bottle from the LCBO.  This is an absolutely incredible beer, period.  I had read some bad things about the ""mass market"" style that Chimay has taken, but as far as Im concerned its just a story, and the beer speaks for itself!  It pours a wonderful dark auburn brown, with golden molasses tones when held to light.  The head is thick, and lasts the whole glass through, leaving a very nice fine lacing.  The smell is sweet and crisp, with strong bread dough notes, yeast, and some fruit that is hard to place.  The taste is exquisite, and so balanced that its remarkable.  Its bold in all aspects, like a trappist should be, but no heavy alcohol taste or smell.  The aftertaste is exactly as it should be; a subdued version of the initial taste.  The balanced nature of the beer lets you pick out little subtleties in the aftertaste that make every sip another adventure, even after youve had it several times.  This beer is so solid, and so balanced, that it should be used as a benchmark to judge other trappist beers.  I know there are better trappist beers out there, but this is the best baseline Ive run across.  If you havent tried this beer yet, make it your next one!
"
1," Nose is full of dark fruit, candi sugars, caramel, and some light Belgian yeast. Pours auburn with a fizzy non lasting head. Sweet dark fruit throughout. Lots of raisin, figs, caramel. Candi sugar, some earthy notes are there. Sweet throughout, but not cloying. Alcohol is noticeable, but not over the top. Nice carbonation as well.
"
1," a bit of light skunk and light smelly cheese. The taste is hoppy (fore all), bitter and water. Not exactly a good or nice beer to drink.
"
1," 12 oz bottle. Poured dark with a frothy head. Smells of roasted malts, with flavors of metal and slightly sour after taste. An interesting style.
"
1," NOV 26, 2011 Nice opaque, amber hue. Sweet and hoppy. Good fizz for a nice mouthfeel. A real quality ale.
"
1," MAY 7, 2004 (75o ml bottle) Cloudy-red coloured with a big head. I wasnt as satisfied as I had thought I would be; some initial sharp bitter citrus flavour with a lasting burn of an aftertaste. Better than average but I definitely enjoy many more Belgian Ales from both sides of the Atlantic.
"
1," SEP 2, 2007 bottle. Its good to know that when youve been kicked out of the local pubs, you can still drive over to Tesco for a few tasty treats. Thanks to my mates for shoving a few of these and a bag of krispy kremes in my hands and pointing me at the checkout. Is it odd that while I bought this, my Belgian friends had English brew? Right, the beer... Amber brown with off white head. Malts and dark fruit in the nose. Taste to match with the addition of peppery spices. Very well rounded and pleasant. A goodun any time, but slightly over-rated in my opinion.
"
1," Bottle, bought @ YNWA, Kolding.	[Bottle #2 in the Kolding Blindtasting, 20th June 2009]	Pours clear orange with a small, creamy, beige head. Aroma is malty, vinious and quite sweet. Some berry notes. Medium carbonation, fine lightly creamy mouthfeel. Flavour is dry, biscuity, vinious, some orangey notes and a little touch of chocolate. Very fine.
"
1," First experience of Chimay beer - a few months ago. Il let the description say it all as I not good with beer descriptions! A wonderful tasting beer, apricot aroma, copper with a white head.  Simply superb.
"
1," The Mrzen when tasted very young (about 2.5 weeks) was malty sweet and quite good despite a bit of green beer taste.  It seemed a bit stronger than your typical Mrzen, which was definitely not a bad thing.  It later on developed a bit of diacetyl, strangely enough, but it was still quite tasty, malty with a bit of hop bite in the finish.
"
1," Hazy, bigger - persistent - white fluffy head; orangey-wheaty nose with a yeasty touch; moderate sweet, slightly sourish flavour, soft MF, medium bodied; yeasty-sweetish-wheaty finish, combined with a little tartness. Pleasant Weizen...........
"
1," Deep copper red wtih about 1/2"" of white head that goes away quickly, but maintains the slight moon ring down the glass until the end. Strong aroma of hops a beer that tasted alot like it smelled. It leaves a medium bittering on the back of your tongue
"
1," Pours nice, reddish, nice head. Looks beautiful in its glass. 	Smell is bitter fruity. Taste is medium full bodied, lightly sweet. Lots of fruits, malt. Light to drink. Pleasant beer.
"
1," Nice and solid dubbel. Hard to add anyhting that the commercial description misses. A nice mixed fruit aroma. A ever so slight step down from the blue (if I remember correctly). Still a top notch effort.
"
1," This dark, cloudy ale does not boast any overwhelming flavors. Instead, it provides a deep, smooth sensation that seemingly could even complement a meat dish. Hints of chocolate are present along with alcohol. Leaves a great aftertaste.
"
1," Off white head atop of tawny port coloured body. Found the aroma was of raisins and figs. Flavour has some slight chocolate, a little fruit(banana) and noticeable alcohol but not offensive. Medium body and an almost syrupy texture.
"
1," Poured with little light penetrating and a nice bubbly off-white head.  Smells raisiny with alcohol, and the alcohol comes through in the flavor along with caramel, fruits and a slightly bitter and very dry finish.  Its alright.
"
1," Very nice. Pours a dark brown with a big head that goes quickly. Very smooth with a fruity flavor and a fruity aroma as well. The alcohol hits as the beer warms and you stand up after putting a couple down within the hour. Very easy to put down a few of these without realizing.
"
1," bottle, thanks to mora2000, clear pour with aroma of rice, coconut milk, flavor is a mix of paste and fruit cocktail
"
1," Hazy dark brown coloured ""8th Trappist"" with an smooth slightly sweet bitter taste. Some hints of caramel and raisin, just wait for the real brew thats will be brewed in France.
"
1,"  Ruby red with a brown haze, large off-white head.  Quite carbonated at first, make sure to allow this one to breathe.  Spicey nose has yeast, fruits, wheat, and is very malty.  Taste has tons of malt, spicey yeast, dark fruit, and some acidic notes to it.  Decent beer, but theres better from Chimay out there.
"
1," Just plain good stuff . My first bottle was from my future father in-law and what  can i say the man knows his beers !!!
"
1," Great dark ruby red color, with a nice head. Noticeable tastes of raisins and caramel, not as good as Chimay Bleu though.
"
1," 0,33L bottle.  Vintage 2006, (enjoy by 2011).  Dark brown pour, dark tan head, very muddy appearance.  Aroma of dark fruit and deep caramelized sugar.  lots of dates.  Flavor has a nice touch of chocolate, date sugar, toasted cereal. Hint of oats.  finishes dry with a suttle carbonation.  distant flavor of dark malt with banana fruitiness.  Superb.  Trappist.
"
1," FEB 10, 2007 Courtesy of Boboski. Thanks, Jason. Massive coffee aroma leaves no room for anything else. Its super concentrated...one of the most powerfully coffee smelling beers youll sniff. One dimendsional? You bet, but it smells good. The body is basically black with a few hints at a ruddy dark brown. The head is dimishing, mocha colored and starts about a thumb thick. Bitter/acidic coffee fore. Very dark coffee/dark chocolate in the fore. It then gets sweet with cream, milk chocolate and sweet malt through the middle. There are also bitter roast malt and coffee accents on into the finish and what may be a pretty healthy dose of hops or just the bitterness from the coffee. You like coffee? Then you cant dislike this. Again....fairly one dimensional, but fun to drink.
"
1,"	This classy Barley Wine develops burnt caramel lengths onto balanced hop resins, while oranges and alcohol burn create complexity.		Further Personal Perceptions"
1," Pours dark brown with a bit of red and a smallish tan head. Aroma of fruit, caramel, raisins, some alcohol comes through. Very nice palate. Beautiful.
"
1," Once again, Chimay is fabulous. I think that the quality of the red, white, & blue are related to their alcohol content, with the highest content beer actually being the best. Nonetheless, all are worderful
"
1," dark brown mediumpour.slight head..fruit&amp;flowers with a dash of yeast to the smell;tastes more of the same.but a stronger emphisis.on yeast.. after a while.great malt&amp;hop.marriage..drinkability..a-..enjoy..malty.
"
1," Draft from Scottys Brewhouse in downtown Indianapolis.  Pours hazy gold with a medium white head.  Aroma of citrus, spice, clove.  Flavor is spice, floral, light hops, citrus- agree with others that the balance is off and something isnt quite right.  But its not bad.  Light mouthfeel.
"
1," Pours medium head that dissipates somewhat quickly.  Sweet, fruity, malty and alcoholic aroma.  Sweet, malty flavor and the alcohol can be very aparent.  Outstanding!
"
1," Draft.  Pours black with a thin tan head.  Aroma is very strong and astringent, mostly that of bourbon.  Smells like window cleaner.  Flavor is way too strong of bourbon in my opinion.  Very hot!  Palate is way too thin and watery.  a disappointment.
"
1," bottle at 1st beer drinking meeting,.  was ok.  better brown ales out there
"
1," Pours a clear yellow with a thin head which dissipates quickly but leaves a ring around the edges. Aroma is stray and light hops. The taste is light crisp with a medium spice from the hops.
"
1," Dark brown body; creamy ring of a brown head. Odd aroma... green, leafy whiskey or something, along with some dry, roasty malt. Interesting aroma... not too sweet or malty. Raw, woody whiskey and dry roasted malt with some light hop hints; maybe some grass. Not meant to be aged in barrels... and/or just not aged properly.
"
1," Tried the blue, now move onto red. First thing I get is the beautiful aroma. So complex already; quite floral and fruity with a nip of alcohol on it, smells delicious. Pours thick copper with a creamy head that hangs around. The smooth silky texture of the beer brings obvious malt and fruit flavours, quite obviously apricot. Goes down with a bit of alcohol warmth and bitterness on the tongue, but nothing offensive at all. It's got quite a range of complexities to it, that I can't really put my finger on. Mainly sweet tropical fruits; like peach, apricot, bananas. More come as I get through it. It keeps you guessing, i'll try not to drink it too fast like the Blue. I'm very much liking this beer, not as much as the blue, but a more easy and different beer altogether. Cheers!
"
1," Bottle. Some slightly chundery characters in the aroma, slightly acidic aroma. Palate is thin and boring, with some acidity in the finish (not good acidity either). Not very good in my opinion.
"
1," I snagged a couple lagers and pilsners from countries I hadnt had beers from before mainly to get the ratings. This one isnt as bad as zywiec, but Im still regreting it. The only reason I would have another one of these was if I were in Armenia(for some g-d awful reason) and there wasnt any other beer to drink.
"
1," It pours a almost see-through nut brown.	Smell with fresh, almost tropical fruit.  Good malt focus.	It got a beautiful mouthfeel, with a tight foam. Good concentration with nuts, raisin and almost a milkchocolat taste. A long aftertaste, but it falls alittle, and are not very concentrated in the end. A good beer, non the less!
"
1," I visited this brewpub in July - surely it can't have closed down?  It was great!  I really enjoyed their wit beer, very refreshing, but more importantly very tasty, with bright. chalky notes.  One of the best beers I tried in Canada.
"
1," SEP 21, 2010 Lots of taste, tons of aroma, this beer is quite tasty. Not sure I believe its actually brewed by monks, but thats not why I would drink beer anyways. Recommend.
"
1," 330ml bottle.  Pours a rich, hazy dark brown with a small head.  Aroma is dark fruits, nuts and some yeast.  Starts with the fruit, then the yeast towards the back of the mouth.  Nice and full in the mouth, carbonation is really lively with fine bubbles, works really well.  Really lovely beer.
"
1," JUL 8, 2011 This aroma is sweet, bready,  with a little spiciness.  The aroma is inviting, a little sweet and fruity., spicy and fruity.   The appearance has a nice red brown color.  The taste was pepper, spicy, fruity.  The  finish is spicy, peppery, pine hops. Medium in body.  Decent overall.
"
1," Bottled. Burgundy. Malty, dry and rather hoppy with some toffee. Notes of banana, dry flowery finish.
"
1," On tap at Rock Bottom Charlotte.  Typically crappy light beer, with nothing really redeeming about it at all.
"
1," Bottled. An amber beer with a slight black sediment floating around under a thin orangey head. The aroma is sweet malty with notes of caramel and alcohol. The flavor is sweet with strong notes of caramel and malt as well as notes of alcohol and bread, leading to a finish with a slight note of metal. Thanks yespr for sharing.
"
1," a very very good oatmeal stout.  IMO this rivals Goose ISlands and thats my current fave.  this is full bodied and nutty.  the aroma is walnut, almond, and chestnut with toasted marshmello with a LOT of roasted malt that gives this beer the feel that it itself was roasted on a barbeque.  interesting.  flavor is LOTS of nutty flavors with some marshmellow and graham cracker (Its a smore!!) with lots of milk chocolate and a little light roast coffee.
"
1," The color was a deep amber/brown.  The head was medium bodied, fizzy, creamy, and light beige.  The aroma was very light raisin, agded/musty, sweet, and dark fruit.  The flavor was alcohol, sweet, dark fruit, and musty.  The palate was very lively.  The finish was warm.
"
1," Aroma very acidic, in a way. Murky milk-chocolate brown pour with very little lasting head and no lacing. Im going to buy a case and age it, give it a try and see how it works. A very complex flavour that I dont have the experience to describe. Its an easy beer to drink, like the Chimay Rouge, but at the same time its an easy beer to drink far too much of. The alcohol content is noticeable, but light  enough that its not overbearing. One of the best beers Ive tasted, and phenomenal given that Chimay is a broad distribution beer.
"
1," Brown/Burgundy in color with a somewhat small but long lasting head. The aroma is all esters and yeast, smells like the good parts of aging fruit. Flavor is similar with prunes/cherries and dark candi sugar flavor. Mouthfeel is thick and protein-rich
"
1," JUN 6, 2007 12oz bottle- A slightly hazy golden in color with a head that dissipates very quickly into a small white lace around the glass. An aroma of spice and wheat. Has an initial taste that it is going to be a nice tasting belgian(more like a hefe) then the taste drops in the middle but comes back on the back end. Has potential.
"
1," malty but not sweet or dry, lightly smokey roasted  light cherry mild rasin, soft, finishes with fig and dark fruit and well balanced bitterness. Complex and luxurious. Unparalleled craftsmanship, would be the best rated beer on earth if it were harder to get.

1," Pint off the cask at BI - Aroma is mild toasted malts, caramel and a touch English hops.  Flavor is a bit stronger but pretty much the same as aroma.  Creamy and smooth palate.  Not a bad ale and better than Dirty Helen.
"
1," Swing top bottle from Quack-Duck, thanks! Deep golden color, firm lasting head. Dusty aroma with a hint of toffee. malty dusty flavor with caramelly, nutty and spicy notes. Vegetables, bitter walnuts and other unpleasant by-flavors. Maybe this beer doesnt travel well, this just didnt work out for me.
"
1," Good hop aroma. Now in 6 packs. One of my local favorites. A cloudy pour, with nice head.
"
1," Pours a cloudy gold with a huge white head.  The nose is very fruity with bananas and candied orange.  There is a nice hoppy bitterness on the tongue and it finishes crisp with a nice bitter after taste.  Nice carbonation and the alcohol is nicely hidden.
"
1," MAY 16, 2011 330ml bottle from Stirchley Wines and Spirits. Pours a cloudy mahogany brown with a small, dissapating, bubbly, caramel coloured head. Aroma of brown sugar, candied fruits, brandy. Boozy flavour, syrup, beautifully sweet. Very nice carbonation, and quite full bodied. Mild warming sensation in the mouth and throat, similar to that of a brandy. A real sense of luxury about this beer, like I should be in a dressing gown with a matching hat sitting in a leather studded chair by an open fire! Lovely jubbley!
"
1," DEC 22, 2004 One of the Worlds great beers. A very good example of its type.  Pours a dark, murky brown colour, with a large off-white head. Yeast, dark fruit, spices and malt dominate the aroma. The taste is malty, spicey, caramel, yeasty and dark fruit. Great body and mouthfeel, warming on the way down.
"
1," I find the complexity of this fine beer increases dramatically with time. I age mine for a minimum of 2 years before I imbibe. You will find the flavor will match the extraordinary smell at just below cellar temp. As the Grand Reserve warms, so does the intensity.	One of my favorite in all the world.
"
1," Red-brown with creamy tan head / Faint, caramel nose / Light to medium body, acidic, with very light finish / Weak flavors of caramel and toasted grain / Mediocre.
"
1," Very dark brown in colour, almost opaque! Nice smell, some sweetness in the aroma, but definately not overpowering! Heavy malt and a great aftertaste, although somewhat a bit more mild than I remember from the first time I sampled it! Still a great beer, but I prefer other belgians still!
"
1," Pours dark and brown. Perfect creamy head. Very tiny bubbles. Aroma is slightly roasted. Somewhat malty. Taste it and you know its a bit heavier a beer than you might have thought. After a few more tastes and you start noticing not just the roasted bitter tastes, but some flowery and tangy characteristics. Its very pleasant. There is noticeable alcohol taste but not overbearing. These flavors balance well
"
1," tasting at GDBTF on 10/18/08.  amber color with 1/4"" white head.  dark fruits and yeast in the aroma. spicy on the tip and through the finish.  med body.  soft on the sides... not bad, but my least favorite of Chimay.
"
1," Bottle at fonefan tasting. Medium head with medium duration. Color is golden. Aroma and taste are malt and hops.
"
1," Pours beautifully with a nice off white foamy head. The color is amber orange and the smell is of fruit, but not too fruity. tastes excellent in the mouth and is very smooth. One of my favorites.
"
1," 341ml clear bottle. Dark/chocolate brown in colour, orange highlights. Creamy beige head, good lacing. Nutty, dusty dryish aroma with hint of roast. Flavour is dark chocolate up front, roasty middle, finishes with mild hops. Some tangy mineral aftertaste. Medium body, creamy mouthfeel, moderate carbonation.
"
1," FEB 17, 2003 This is a superb ale! I have drank all of what Chimay has to offer and I have never had any one that I thought was bad! A slight bitterness that first hits the palate, then diminishes into a malty hops flavor! Thick head that is medium lasting as all chimay's are. Bottom Line I loved just like the rest of them!
"
1," A little dissapointed by this one, but the waitress mentioned that it was cloudy and a little young.  Some chocolate malt and roast in the flavor, but the palate was a bit weak.
"
1," Bottle.  Pours a nice dark brown with a nice, foamy tan head that slowly fades.  Taste is of yeast, banana, fruit, malt, caramel and spice.  Similara aroma.  Well balanced.  A nice, complex, enjoyable, drinakble brew that is worth picking up every now and then.  On par with the Red and White and is hard to choose a favorite.
"
1," Not my favorite in the Chimay family but still a great Trappist. This one is kind of like the black sheep in the family; has a bit more ""attitude"" than its siblings. Deep copper in color with a slightly off-white head. Spicy nose with a well balanced bitter taste.
"
1," Pours deep red & brown with an off-white head.  I got this in The Sundial Restaurant in Atlanta.  The waiter presented this beer like it was an expensive bottle of wine.  I loved the taste and feel of this beer.  it went down smooth with a long lasting flavor.  A must have!!
"
1," Hazy copper with only a small head. Mild fruity aroma. Fruity malt taste--I noticed apricots primarily. Well carbonated.
"
1," Mildly sweet aroma but not alarmingly sweet like many strong ales. Beatiful swirling hypnotizing pour in a darker brown liquid. Decent fizz on the palate. Alky shows thru on the tongue at times. I guess I am a little crestfallen considering the percentile of this brew. Chimay white was much more enjoyable than this, but what should I expect for a strong ale.  Strong ales are not one of my favorites. I just thought that it would be a little more refined than the typical american wanna bee belgie strong ale. Not what I expected. Reminds me of the letdown when, in eager anticipation from the raters on this site, that I tasted my first highly rated imperial stout. Finish is not long lingering but it is a little alky bitter.
"
1," Pours slightly darker than a macro.  No head at all.  Slightly spiced candy Belgian aroma.  I have to say when I first sipped this I didnt know that the style was and expected a American Pilsner from the name.  I thought something was wrong when I got a definite Belgian flavor.  I read the bottle to see what it was.  OK...not knowing what I was getting I could pick out the style.  But after knowing, this is bad.  It has that sort or what I call dirty candy Belgian taste to it but it really tastes like floor cleaner.  Sort of like Pine Sol.  Super perfumy.  No body.
"
1," FEB 26, 2008 Poured a deep copper color.  Aroma is malt and nuts.  Flavor is slightly fruity and sweet, but the finish turns more towards bitter.  A good solid beer, but Chimay Blue is better.
"
1," 500 ML bottle n Germany. Pours to cloudly brown color, head white but leaves quickly. Very very nice banana clove aroma. Very bubbly for a Hefe but a very good beer over all. Pleasent but different Hefe. Would drink again.
"
1," Pours a dark brown color with a medium off-white head. Light lacing. Aroma is light malt with a nutty aspect. Medium-bodied with malt, brown sugar and hops flavors. Finish is equal parts malt and chocolate. Pretty good.
"
1," Winey, full bodied, yeasty, malty, rich and flavorfull, a great winter beer, a great nightcup, quite expensive but well worth it.
"
1," water.  If there issuch a thing as too light, this is it.  Didn't look like much either.
"
1," 50 cL bottle. Pours slight hazy yellow with a lacing white head. Light malty and notes of bitterhops. Flavour is mild spiced hoppy and with a subdued malt base. Ends with a light bitterness and medium dry.
"
1," [cask at Bon Accord] Big malty aroma, dried fruit, dates, some background citric notes. full body, very sweet upfront, leads to a restrained bitterness. This is in no way an IPA and the alchol shows a bit more than id like, but still a very nice beer.
"
1," The whiter-fruit Chimay in my opinion.  Green grapes, banana, vanilla is more discernable than the darker plum and raisin of the Chimay White.
"
1," Tasted 4/17/08.  12oz bottle.  Dark pitch hue.  Finger width of beige head.  Base oatmeal chocolate and anise in the nose.  Mild aromas of brownies and toffee and, yes, coffee.  Medium bodied with big malts.  Coffee and toffee flavors.  Smooth tootsie roll malts followed by acidic coffee bitterness.  All malt driven.  Faint hop presence.  Finishes mildly sticky with a nice tingling effervescence coating the tongue.  Pleasant rolling palate.  Hits the tart and bitter nicely.  Touch of a dark fruit ester.  Solid brew!
"
1," I prefer this to the white (hope my rating reflects this - I cant remember).  Looks great, nice aroma with a touch of spice, very smooth flavour.  Probably the easiest Chimay to drink, but not the nicest.
"
1," 330ml brown bottle. Excellent appearance - ruby brown, light tan head stays creamy and tight. Great lacing. A touch of alcohol in the nose, along with some dark fruit and sweet malts. It has some noticable hop flavours, dark sweet malt, some roasted notes. Some dryness and yeast spiciness in the finish with late alcohol warming. Really glad the local LCBO finally had it in stock! Rating #200.
"
1," Small head, not much aroma, taste was smooth, not harsh, but not long lasting. just a hint of sweeetness
"
1," ahhhh!  a great beer!  mastered and excellent!  superb!	clean taste, nice alcohol %!
"
1," Pours a copper cloudy copper with a fine off-white head. The aroma is yeasty, with dark fruit, clove, banana, and a hint of caramel. Flavor is similar, with a soft sweetness and a lightly bitter finish. This is frothy and creamy on the palate, with fuzzy carbonation. Nice crisp finish.
"
1," Shared bottle at RBNAG-11. Tall white head. Orangey golden body. Sweet, toffee-scented. Notes of ripe fruits. Heavily sweet malt flavor. Rounded with fruit and yeast tones. Medium full. Light biterness and mild spices in the ending.
"
1," Label describes it as ""high hopped, high bitterness, true IPA ... like an open handed slap ..."" It is a bit bold, but not overly bold. I actually found it quite pleasant. Malty-sweet nose. Tasty malt flavors of cocoa powder, light toffee and bread. Hops are citrusy and bright, though not as lemony as most citra IPAs Ive had. Regardless, its hop flavors and aromas are very nice. Healthy bitterness to boot. Solid beer.
"
1," Bottle@Home. Malty, peach, apple, light herbal and perfume aroma. Amber color, beige huge head, good lace. Sweet, fruity, bitter, floral, herbal. Medium body, light dry. Interesting, flavourful, not really a German character.
"
1," JUL 3, 2005 Bottle.  Corn and barley malt aroma - slightly sweet.  Golden yellow color but litlle efferverscence or head.  Slightly sweet barley malt flavor with moderate hops finish.   This tastes more like a German lager than a pils.
"
1," A nice, malty ale with a definite Belgian quality to it, this one had an almost black appearance, lightly sweet nose, and a fairly light (medium at most) mouthfeel.  Not too heavy, and good with the bar food.
"
1," Pours with a dark brown to black body topped by a thin to medium thick head with some lacing.  Its sweet and malty with a note of licorice and a very slight roastiness.  Medium to full bodied and smooth.
"
1," Muddy brown.. Perfect, welcomed carbonation in this one.  Fruity, malty, thick taste.  Very good.
"
1," MAR 21, 2010 750 ml bottle. poured amber with a fizzy white head with huge bubbles. dissapates quickly. wonderful aroma. malt, caramal, fruits, sweetness. flavours are a beautiful balance of the aromas. yeasty flavours typical of the style. silky in the mouth and complex yet easy to drink. this is a truely wonderful beer.
"
1," (bottle) Cloudy and hazy amber colour with a mid-sized foamy almost white head. Intense aroma of ripened oranges and cloves, moderately sweet wheat-malty. Smooth mouthfeel, medium bodied, sweet malty and fruity taste with a yeasty and clovy, slightly hoppy finish. Aromatic and quaffable Weizen.
"
1," Pours a hazy orange with a medium white head. Aroma is hoppy with citrus and pine notes. Flavor is also very hoppy with citrus, pine, earthy notes and some spices. Medium body with medium carbonation. A very bitter, tasty brew.
"
1," The predominating maltiness of this beer demonstrates itself mainly in the many dried fruit aromas and flavors...figs, currants, apricots, maybe caramel too...plus a definite alcohol presence.  Nicely done.
"
1," This dark brown ale has amber highlights and pours with a beautiful head that appears to have two distinct layers. The lower 2/3 of the head has a medium density bubble, while the upper 1/3 has a very fine bubble density and looks very creamy. The head retention on this beer is fantastic, and it leaves an enticing lace. The aroma has a maltiness to it, but also exhibits many earthy tones, as well as a hint of orange peel. The flavor is simply an explosion of taste. Definite citus notes, very heavy on the orange peel, but followed by caramel sweetness. The alcohol is noticeable. There also seems ot be a spiciness to the beer, with pepper and maybe a hint of coriander in the finish. There is so much going on it is hard to isolate the flavors, which blend together into a beautiful kaleidoscope of taste.
"
1," Weak malty nose, with hints of old hops. Golden colored body, small white head. Malty flavor, cardboardy, weak hops.
"
1," Chimay red This ale pours an amber colour with a thin tan head good carbonation supprisingly hoppy aroma thin mouthfeel and an unusual crispnesss for a belgian the 7% abv must have something to do with it as I am more accustomed to the triples and abbeys.so needless to say it lacks some of the more winey alchohol presence, not a bad thing. Biscuity sweet malt finish fruity hop aroma very drinkable. While I find most belgians to be one and done because of the body and abv this lighter crisper example is very easily followed by a second and third. I did notice a slight mettalic taste near the end of the bottle when the yeast sediment was more prevalent. Not in a bad way just a hint on the finish.
"
1," DEC 26, 2011 bottle@home"
1," Your typical abbey dubbel, a dark brown with a thin head.  The aroma is dominated by malt, caramel, and dark fruits.  Taste is mostly dark fruit combined with a slight woody taste, malts, and spices.  A solid, if unspectacular, abbey dubbel.
"
1," Copper brown with a fizzy white head. Sweet molasses and earthy roasted grain aroma and taste with a sticky palate.
"
1, 7/2/2005 Total Score
1," Bottle. Neutral light bananany nose. Orange amber, off-white lacing head. Chewy, fruity, estery retro-nasal. Fairly noncommital.
"
1," AUG 6, 2004 (Bottled, BBE 2007) Reddish brown, slightly orange color with a medium, tanned head. Crisp, ""Chimay-yeasty"", slightly sweet and sour aroma with a slight smokiness. Fruity and surprisingly refreshing, wineous flavor with lots of yeast and berries. Sweetish, and a bit sour. Full-bodied, oily, refreshing, sticky, lightly wineous and quite carbonated - although very tolerable - palate. An excellent, complex and refreshing trappist. These guys do know how to brew!
"
1," JUL 12, 2008 Hazy, ruddy hue with an evaporating gusher head.  Toffee and candied fruits, sherried, with perfume and rosemary.  Caramel sweet, stone fruit acidity finishing in a whirl of yeasty dryness and bitter herbs.  Thin-ish with harsh carbonation and a watery texture.		Overly acidic and yeasty; really needs food for balance.		33 cl bottle, best before 2011.		75 cL bottle, goblet, 05/99 bottling, 54 degrees.  Tall, off-white, frothy head is quickly diminishing.  The body is a murky red-brown.  Mild coffee, milk chocolate, caramel, nutty malt (heavy); flowery hops (light); earth, cobweb yeast (heavy); raisin, plum, red wine, port, oak, toffee, alcohol aromas.  Moderately sweet throughout, lightly bitter, lightly acidic finish.  Flavor is lightly than the aroma led me to believe it would be.  Medium body, fizzy carbonation, watery texture with an alcohol-drying effect.  I'd really like to try a fresher bottle to see if the robustness I was expecting is present.  The bottom line is"
1," overall a wonderfully crafted beer has a light flowery aftertaste caused by the fermentation of the yeast and it is not as bitter as most strong beers. This is one of the best beers I have ever had!! a must try
"
1," 50 cL bottle. Pours cloudy deep orange with a small off-white head. Aroma is grassy and hoppy, light yeasty. Sweet malty flavoured to a quite hoppy, mild spiced and fruity to bitter. Light yeasty touch. Ends with a nice hoppy flavour.
"
1," aroma has hops, yeast, earth... flavour consists of hops and yeast again, bread, some fruit, malt... very lively, very earthy mouthfeel... not that big of a body though... its roughness makes it great as does its beautiful appearance
"
1," Golden, small, stable and lacy white head; sweet-grainy, a bit honeyish nose; moderate sweet, slightly bitter flavour, medium bodied; distinctive hoppy traces in the sweet-bitter finish. Good stuff.......
"
1," Deep red color almost like the label itself.  Cloudy and pours with a large head.  Aroma and Flavor is sweet, yeast and fruity. Mango and figs.  Slight bitterness.  Finish is mildly dry and has a lingering sweetness.
"
1," a basket of spices, including ginger, sage, rosemary and oregano. Also mixed in is a touch of peat, toffee sauce, and traces of rubber. Taste"
1," This Beer tastes like soap to me. Its got some nice malty flavor, but its got this sharp nasty bitter flavor that stays in my mouth. Not my thing.
"
1," Bottle. Black in color with a good sized tan head. Oak and bourbon dominate the aroma with some roasted malt and coffee as well. After you get past the flavor of the bourbon, the roasted malts have trouble making their presence known. They are there, but in the background, along with some coffee and chocolate. I wish it had been the other way around.
"
1," (Bottle, Akkurat, Stockholm) Dark reddish brown colour with frothy, beige head. Malty nose with dried fruit, roasted grain, gingerbread cake and hints of citrus peel. Malty taste with dark and/or dried fruit, dark cherries, dark rye bread, toffee and a rather spicy finish with sweetish citrussy notes. Balanced sweetness, medium body, very well balanced. Heavy malt character. Nice beer.
"
1," Clear golden with a medium to large white head. Malty nose with grassy hops. Flavor was dry with malt and grassy hops. Finished dry and bitter. Clean with high drinkability.
"
1," MAR 26, 2006 I think this was my first Abbey Dubbel which ment why it was weaker than a triple or quadrupel. Pours a dark mahogany with very fluffy white head. Aroma is fruity and the taste is the same as it. Fruity but you could tell it was weak, the alcohol didnt have the kick and make it that much fruitier, ok but Ill take a stronger abbey anyday.
"
1," A very nice Belgian. Poured dark murky brown with fluffy head. Little lacing, though (and why do I really care about that?). Taste was rich and complex...sweet but not overly so (like some Belgian knockoffs). The monks do it right.
"
1," JAN 25, 2003 Cloudy red, foamy white head that dissipitates rather quickly.  Yeast and a little fruit in the nose.  Spritzy and yeasty with a complex maltiness.  Finishes lightly bitter.  Could be a better beer, too much CO2.  The least of the trappists.
"
1," Yeasty aroma.  Mild, stale bitterness with a sweet finish.  I found this to be under hopped and boring.
"
1," i recently had this gem of an ale fruity and very good on the palet the rich head complimentsthe exciting burst in your mouth on the aftertaste
"
1," Spicy yeast notes in the aroma.  Mouthfeel is full and fizzy.  Flavors of raisins, dates, plums, toffee, roasted nuts, and caramel.  Finish is slightly sweet.
"
1," Dark amber colored beer, small head that had quickly disappeared. Average smell, pretty nice taste. Nice carbo, medium to full body.
"
1," Had this beer on 3/6/2007.  Color is a hazy brown with good carbonation and a nice tight head.  Aroma is a sour malty scent.  Taste is mild and fruity.  Starting a medium body it goes down with a fizzy feel.  Finish comes on with a light malt flavor that seems a bit sweet but has nice sour tones that come out on the end, then finishes with a mild fruity yeast flavor and a light bitterness.  In the end it leaves you clean and felling refreshed.  Its much lighter then the Blue and a much more refreshing beer then you would expect.  If it wasnt so expensive it would be a great beer to have everyday.
"
1," Orange color with a dense off-white head. Slight maltiness, some of spice in the aroma. Medium-bodied; Malt character in the taste and not much else. Aftertate with some spicyness, but pretty subtle. As far as a Marzen goes not my favorate but I'd order again.
"
1," The latest in my i know for a fact i drank this in front of the computer, how did i not rate it? series.  Proper glass = perfect pour.  Dark caramel hazy brown, strong fluffy dense barely tan head.  Cola nut and prune juice, sweet raisin.  Enough alcohol heat to distract from the moderately dense fig and raisin notes.  Not entirely syrupy like the other stronger trappists.  Dont get me wrong.  I really like this beer.  But when you factor in Divine Inspiration to your beer, I expect something angelic.
"
1," 341 ml (clear) bottle from The Beer Store (part of Winter Mixer).  Pours a bright, light yellowish gold with small white head.  Aroma is grainy and lemony.  Flavour is similar with a slight skunkiness to it.  A little thin; fizzy carbonation.  A cut above most macro pale lagers but nothing special.
"
1," Tasted a lot like whiskey or whatever it was aged in. Dark and musky. Lots of alcohol throughout. Sweet with some vanilla aspects. Not really the best, but it did pack quite a kick. I think a bit more malts or some other flavors would have been nice. At points the alcohol became too overpowering.
"
1," 6th August 2008. On tap at GBBF. Clear brown beer. Feels a bit like a barleywine but not quite as strong as a lot of them. Malty with brandy and porty finish.
"
1," Hazy, dark brown with off-white, tight-bubbled head. The nose is fruit-filled and sweet  overripe plums and grapes plus a hint of strawberry and cotton candy. The fruitiness comes through in the flavor though it seems you have to work a little harder to get at it than other Belgian ales. Sweet plums, breads, malts. The ending is spicy with peppery alochol. Medium body with a short to moderate, sticky finish.
"
1," Enjoyed on tap a the brewpub.  Brown colour, soapy off-white head.  Great lace.  Stars mlty, with a decent understated bitter finish.  An American brown in a strong style.  Good drinkability.  Malty aromas.  A tad above average mouthfeel.
"
1," Pours a lasting beige head with no lace and a hazy brown-copper body.  Smells of dried fruit and dark sugar.  Flavor is raisin, dried fruit, brown sugar.  Lasting dried fruit finish and champagne-like carbonation in the mouth.
"
1," A fairly dark color and medium head, Full bodied but a little too much bite. Flavor is quite good with a little malty edge.  I prefer the Chimay red but this is a good beer, just not my favorite
"
1," Simplly put,  this is one of the best beers I have ever sipped.  Right from the start the aroma of the beer was nearly a breath of freash air, infused with citrus and hops. Its finsish was very smooth yet had a subtle punch.  I defintly suggest this beer to anybody who can find it.
"
1," acidic, sharp, cheap coffee, and tasteful, light bourbon notes. Palate is medium. Flavor is better. More bourbon notes are apparent though they dont dominate. Its smooth, balanced with tasteful oak and vanilla highlighting the rougher porter flavors. Not too bad.
"
1," light on taste and flavor. some malt, brown sugar, mild hops. pretty tame.
"
1," Dark amber pour and light tan head. Light toffee, caramel, and malt aroma. some floral hops. Taste is weak and similar of caramel and malt. not overly hoppy taste and not bitter. Really mild overall and none to little roasted character. Good brown, I think. Good either way. has to be to win a gold.
"
1," Bottle. Pours amber with an off-white head.Aroma spice , yeast, malt, malt, orange and alcohol.Flavor is sweet and warming with some notes of yellow apples and caramel.Medium body, average carbonation.Delightfull beer.

1, roasted malts.Taste
1," 330 ml bottle. Medium brown, slightly reddish, with small flakes of yeast and a creamy, thin, lasting head. Aroma is plumbs, raisins, yeast and some alcohol. Flavour is strong and full, sweet malts, fruits and caramel. Long warm aftertaste.
"
1," Bottled. A deep red-brown beer with a huge bubbly brown head. The aroma is sweet malty with notes of caramel and dusty hops as well as light notes of alcohol. The flavor is sweet malty with notes of caramel and bread as well as lighter notes of alcohol, leading to a dry finish where notes of bread and caramel lingers. Thanks yespr for sharing.
"
1," Pours a nice black with a medium light tan head. Aroma and flavor are full of chocolate, coffee, nuts & malt.  Average for a stout.
"
1," (Draught) I found that they were sold all out of the bottled version so I was lucky to find this on tap. Pours a thin, beige head with an orange-amber body. Nose and flavour of sweet English malts and bitter PNW hoppiness. By far the best beer at the Hagar. Too bad the bar is SO unimpressive...
"
1," Dark clear ruby beer, firm white head. Aroma of malts, fruits, yeast tones and light candy sugar and caramel. Flavour light sweet, malts, fruity, light candy sugar with fresh hops shining through. Finish bit sweet with a nice bitterness.	(From 75cL bottle @ home)
"
1," Pour is amber orange with a somewhat thick head for the style.  Aroma is vegetal, herbs, and some grapefruit hops.  Flavor is more on the malty side with some bitterness in the finish.  Not the smoothest IPA, but then again, most IPAs arent supposed to be smooth.  Very average within its class, which makes sense given its style pct.   Kind of an interesting side note.  My wife picked a 6 pack of this up thinking my friend liked IPAs.  I told her that one of the few styles my buddy didnt care for were IPAs (which meant score more for me).  Yey!
"
1," Corked Bottle.	Subtle sweet aroma escapes.	Decent belgian appearance.	Flavor is good with not much character.	Palate keeps you drinking.	A good Dubbel but I expect more from Chimay, this ale should be better.
"
1," 12 oz. bottle.  Pours a light amber with a medium white head.  Aroma of malt and grassy hops.  Tastes light with hints of hops and citrus.  OK.

1," Very dark brown colour with a slightly brownish head. The taste is sweet and fruity with some hints of chocolate. It has a sweet and a bit fruity aroma. (Bottle 33cl, Bottle 75cl)
"
1," (swing top bottle) Clear dark amber colour with a mid-sized off-white frothy head. Slightly sweet toasted malt aroma with caramel, citric elements and slightly floral and herbal hops in the background. Light sweet flavour and toastmalty taste, slightly bready and nutty with caramel; medium to light body; dry light bitter, hoppy and nutty finish, but also a bit mouldy.
"
1," Virginia Beer Fest 2007. Dark brown body with a creamy tan head. Sweet roasted malt aroma with some fruity hints. Rum soaked fruit and chocolate flavor with some caramel and molassas in the background.
"
1," Cherries, apricots, a bit vinous. Rich and complex, very Belgian. A little stable or barnyard. A great beer.
"
1," Celebrating the 4th of July by trying this beer out, I have been waiting for the opportunity. Pours dark brown/copper with a frothy, off-white head. Poured into giant goblet. Some aromas of caramel, and spices. Taste is pretty phenomenal. Tastes of mild caramel, some hints of warm dough/bread, hints of smoke/roast, subdued candy sugars, and lots of mixed Belgian spices. Not as many fruit notes in this one in comparison to other beers in this style, the spices dominate. Very smooth, and easy to drink. I might try to age a bottle later on. While it is a bit overpriced, this is still a solid beer.
"
1," Bottle, thanks Quack-Duck. Orange amber, low head. Molassis and heather aroma. Light caramel, a hint smoke, balanced to boredom. Medium to light dry body, quick finish.
"
1," Brown colour with ruby highlight and a thin white head. A chocolate aroma with strong maltiness as well. Medium-bodied; Strong nuttiness, chocolate and malt tastes. Overall, better than the average brown (I style I typically don't like) and one of the best from the visit! I had this on draught at Big River (owned by Gordon Biercsh) in Chattanooga, Tennesse on 26-September-2003.
"
1," Reddish color and fruity taste.  Available at Downtown Wine & Spirits in Somerville, MA
"
1," 12 oz. can with an overly active pour to my SA lager glass, hazed, orange/amber hue, creamy beige, ultra billowy head foam of hollow bubbles and froth, and bubbly ribbons of lacing. The aroma was mainly spicy citrus, with some mid-fruit, slight pine, and light caramel sweetness. The flavor offered some moderate hop bitterness, but was a very light presentation of the aroma notes, in a light body, and low carbonation, with most of the effervescence wasted in the pour and head. An average IPA, with a little warmth, light dryness to the finish, and mainly sessionability.
"
1," 12 bottle in Pint Glass.  Citrus Aromoas with straw like malts.  dark yellow brown color.  white head.  High carbonation, slightly slick.  Some lingering bitterness.  Good citrus hop flavors.  Fairly well balanced.
"
1," Alkoholisch angehauchter Antrunk, slich, getreidig, hohl. Es mangelt definitiv an Vollmundigkeit, die bis zum Ende nicht vorhanden ist. Die Se strt auch den hellen Hopfen, der so etwas plrrig wirkt und mit dem Malz versucht, die wrzigen Noten darzustellen. Zum Ende versucht sich das Bier so in Wrzigkeit, bleibt im Endeffekt aber doch wieder mild. Trinkbares Bier, absolut nichts Besonderes. 7/8/8/7/9/8
"
1," JUN 7, 2007 Bottle (650ml) shared at Biegamans Summer Gathering courtesy of blankboy.  Black, small bubbly tan head.  Sweet bourbon alcohol aroma.  Nice taste - dry oatmeal, bourbon - nice mix, not overpowering.  Oak, chocolate as well, agreed with blankboy, this one achieves a nice balance.  Compared to the very small sample I had two and half years ago - I really enjoyed it!				Original rating"
1," (Draught)  Pours a clear copper body with a small off-white head.  Aroma of florals, citrus, and caramel.  Flavor of hops, lightly toasted mlat, and nuts.
"
1," A bit murky after (carefully) pouring, but fairly dark in colour so its not THAT noticable! The off white head has that soapy look to it to begin with but dies down, not that tight though. Spicy/malty nose is quite pronounced with the palate has a similar characteristics, these, however, fade and the alcohol comes to the fore and this dominates the finish. Ok, but not the classic I was hoping for. Asda Carlisle.
"
1," MAY 13, 2007 Tawny brown colour. Dense head. Malt in the aroma, but more muted than I expected. Sweetish malt flavour with a  somewhat coarse yeasty sourness. Quite sharp finish which subsides leaving a residual sweetness. Fine, but nothing exceptional here, in my view.
"
1," The head was medium sized, tan with fine-medium bubbles.The body was black and the nose was malty and hoppy.The lacing was good with this beer.The flavor was that of roasted coffee and the mouthfeel was smooth.
"
1," This was amber/red with a small head.  It was a medium body, malty, lightly hopped.  This was a nice dessert beer.
"
1," bottle, mit Dank an Frankenland! Clear golden yellow, large white head. Resiny-hoppy nose. Medium-bodied, malty base, not as hoppy as expected (the hop aroma s quite intensive), rather sweet and malt-accented. Reminds me more of a German Helles than of a Bohemian Pilsener - nevertheless a flawless product.
"
1," 11.20 oz. bottle from The Andersons, Columbus, OH.  Lovely orange-red with tons of tiny sediment at the bottom of the bottle; monstrous, white, fizzy, frothy head thats easily recreated with some light swirling.  Aroma is Belgian yeast, alcohol, and apple/pear.  Flavor is more of the Belgian yeast with an excellently balanced and complementing light bitterness; slight pleasant pungency (the description says ""astringency""); light alcohol warmth and evaporation through the nose.  At first I felt this was too thin but as I drank it, it seemed to be come more full; TONS of carbonation, with the beer becoming just a bunch of bubbly froth in the mouth until the beer is allowed to sit and ""burn off"" some of it; slightly sticky after all.  Overall, this is not a knockout beer; what is impressive about it is the sheer craft of the beer; it wont knock you on your ass, but its impressive how subtle and how incredibly well balanced it is, how it all fits how and all aspects of the beer just work together.  I am looking forward to some of the ""heavier"" Trappists.
"
1," Bottle @ fonefan tasting. Nice head with good duration. Color is amber. Aroma and taste are caramel, fruits, citrus and malt. A little sour and watery.
"
1," MAY 9, 2004 The most commercial Trappist but still a great beer.	Nice foamy off-white head on a brown/red body. Aroma is roasted malt, spices, caramel, fruit and a fine balance of alcohol.	Flavor has tones of almond, chocolate, liquorice and dark roasted malt. A full-bodied and tasty beer!
"
1," Very sweet and yeasty. Dark brown in color.  Not my favorite Belguim, but an excellent beer never the less.
"
1," This was quite hoppy as mst IPAs but it was a bit over board.  The aroma was much better than the taste.
"
1," A beer like this is like a chocolate milkshake. You dont always want it all the time, its a bit heavy. But when you do its oh-so-good. Chimay is one of the easiest to find of the Belgians too.
"
1," A great trappist beer. The best thing about it is the color, never have I had such a perfect color. Head did not last very long however, weaker flavor than I was expecting.   Great beer nonetheless.  Not sure which of the Chimay selections is best...
"
1, Pours hazy dark amber with a big frothy white head and good lacing 	Aroma
1," A nice amber colour, with a foamy white head. Lively carbonation. Aromas of caramel, fruits, malts and hops. According to me, the best of the Chimay beers, instead of a strong alcoholic finish.
"
1," OCT 8, 2006 Bottle. Dark amber color with a nice head, very complex flavors. Hints of different spices and fruits. One of my favorite beers. Great beer.	Vintage 2001. Dark amber color with a nice head, very complex flavors. Hints of different spices, alcohol and fruits.
"
1," dark black, its creamy, chocolately. Yes sweet stout, and decidedly drinakble. Only 4.5% alcohol by weight makes it presentable at lunchtime.
"
1," Warm dark brown with little head. Nutty aroma is mild, and hard to discern especially from the taster glass. Some breadiness is redeeming. Nutty flavors and a nice malt character. Dry finish. Sessionable, although lacking in that which would make it shine.
"
1, Odeur dhoublon avec une pointe de miel. Apparence
1," on tap.  Poured a nice copper with a nice head.  Aroma was hoppy and somewhat floral.  The flavor was acrid and overcarbonated, but overall pretty enjoyable
"
1, Odeur de caramel avec une pointe de miel. Apparence
1," Nice soft, fruity aroma	-Appearance"
1," Opaque black with nice tan head and mine came with a horseshoe design for good luck. Very nice chocolate and charcoal aroma with lots of chocolate malt. Soft and creamy mouthfeel. Lots of smoke in the finish, adding to the nice flavor profile. Toasty too. Not complex but a solid brew.
"
1," A light amber color with a thin white head. Caramel malts, slightly toasty aroma. Some carmel flavors, toasted malts, a little thin.
"
1," 33 cl bottle purchased in a gift pack at Spirits RB. Pours a murky brown with light carbonation and lots of floating yeast with a huge frothy off white head. Aroma of yeast, grain, slight sugar and over ripe banana. Full bodied with a creamy feel that finishes extra dry. Flavor is sort of alet down with an initial metallic flavor that passes.The rest of the flavor seems to be grains and fruit but I am distracted bt the overall dryness of this beer. If your going with Chimay stick with the blue!!
"
1," Draft.  Another cloudy appearnce (due to being unfilltered)--which I liked that.  Aroma was a little fruity, not overwhelming though.  Not too bad of an American wheat brew.
"
1," Tasted at Noogfest 4.0 (2008). This Belgian Ale pours a medium black color from a 750ml bottle. Small sized white foamy head. The aroma is roasted malt, yeasty and dark fruit. A medium to light bodied Belgian Ale. The malts are chocolate and toffee. The hops are earthy. Lots of flavors going on here, some roasted malts and some smoke as well. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.
"
1," 22 oz. 2007 bottle courtesy of jcwattsrugger at the 2008 Richmond Summer Gathering in Williamsburg. Thanks John! Rating 666. Drk brown pour with a light brown head. Aroma of roasted malts, caramel and dark fruits. Very fruity taste with stone fruit notes and some nuttiness. Someone else in the group thought there were infection signs, but I didnt see any. Medium bodied.
"
1," Pours dark murky brown / crimson with a frothy tan head.  The aroma has caramel malt, soda shop malt, figs, dates, light earthiness, dough and light spice that reminds me of cinnamon.  Medium frothy body with very soft carbonation.  The taste starts with earthy caramel malt, lots of biscuit, dark fruits and some sourness.  The finish is spicy and somewhat astringent.  A good beer, but not up to some of the other Trappist brews.
"
1," Draft sampler at Barley island. Light brown color with a small head that diminished quickly. Light sweet caramel aroma. Medium body. Moderate sweet malty flavor with a medium finish. Soft sample of this style.
"
1," Bottled. An unclear deep red beer with a light brown and small foam. Malty aroma, sweet with some caramel. The flavour is malty, some spiciness and dry. The body is not as strong  as other trappist beer. Light bitterness at the end. Nice and drinkable.
"
1," The bottle looks simple, but good, the beer in the glass also. Starts strong and yeasty, not too fruity, light notes of banana. Also quite sourish, but very well balanced. Finish with lemon notes. Very drinkable and good hefeweizen!
"
1," Bottle (gusher)... Vero Beach GET YOUR RUDOLPH ON Throwdown Pours black with a huge, frothy, beige head. The nose is chocolaty and nutty with an undertone of bourbon, vanilla and toasted oak. Medium-bodied with fizzy carbonation. The flavor presents semi-sweet espresso and dark chocolate alongside lesser notes of toasted nuts, coconut and vanilla. Finishes hearty and rich with a bourbony aftertaste. Upon opening, all the gushing screamed infection, but this wasnt the case.  No infection that had really taken hold was detected. Bottle courtesy of jcwattsrugger! 
"
1," bottle from fox and the hound in lewisville, tx served in a pint glass.  poured  dark brown with a thick beige head.  aroma of caramel and spice.  a good smooth flavor of caramel, spice, dark fruits, and alcohol.  this was my first chimay and i have no idea why i have waited so long to try it.  an excellent belgian strong.
"
1," Nice fruity aroma and beutiful reddish brown color. A nice drinkable belgian. Dry, fruity, and a touch of hops. Quite enjoyable.
"
1," Honey entry which fades quickly to bitter malt and then exits all together. The finish had this weird ear-wax like bitterness to it, same thing I noticed on the their pepper lime beer. Perhpas some dead frog?
"
1," Bottle. Brown. Almost no head. When opened the bottle explodes into my pants and makes it wet. Bad start. So maybe a little too carbonated. Aroma has caramel, banana and malts. Taste is medium with good sweetness. Bitter finish
"
1," Great but I prefer The Bleu one
"
1,"perfume,banana....	Appearance"
1," Golden. Light pale malt aroma.  Low to moderate bitterness but some decent pale malt character.  Balanced, with a mineral accent in the finish.
"
1," Light tan head (not as compact as other trapiste beers), dark dark brow color, careful with the sediment. Very fresh, sweet and spirited taste, not at all like the almost violent  Rochefort Trappistes 10! I love it!
"
1," some bananas, spicy and dry yeastiness, lemongrass. Unspectacular but inoffensive.
"
1," Bottle pours black with a medium head.  Aroma is chocolate and espresso with lots of Berry vinous notes.  Flavor is big roast and smoke with dry red vinous notes coming forward and finishing with lots of grassy hops.  Good stuff.
"
1," MAY 14, 2005 Pours a dark brownish color with a nice amount of foamy white head.  Aroma is sweet and spicy.  Flavor is light on the palate, sweet with raisiny spicy finish. Only the slightest bit of an alcohol taste.  Overall, delicious.
"
1," On tap at Chattanooga location. Reddish brown in the glass with an off white head that left some lacing. Subdue aroma of hops and honey. The flavor made up for the aroma with pine, honey, citrus and a malt background. Medium body. Pleasing mouth full.
"
1," Pours dark brown with hints of red, absolutely no head to speak of this time around.  The aroma is so complex compared to the first two!  Lighter in plum, sweet malting, some woodiness, and lots of yeast.  The promises of sweet malt and fruit come through in the taste, some very well hidden floral hopping thats definitely there but taking a back seat to the front palate.  Tremendous caramel aftertaste, and so silky smooth going down.  Wow, praise the Lord, what a beer!
"
1," Bottle pours hazy amber/brown with thin white head. Aroma is dark fruits and alcohol. First taste is sweet but it is very well balanced. Finish is clean. Carbonation is perfect. Just as good as the grand reserve.
"
1," Hmmm, I was reasonably impressed with this offering.  Pour a deep dark amber color, with a head that has a mind of its own.  Thick and creamy and everything that I could ask for in an appearance.  A flower shop of fragrances in the aroma, beautiful.  A slightly sweet taste that has so many complexities, that I could not even begin to go into detail, I could write a whole other review just for the flavor.  Clean and refrshing in the finish.
"
1," I really was expecting more from this, especially after how good the White was. It wasnt bad, but it lacked a little bit in the flavor and aroma department.
"
1," bertriebene Schaumkrone, ich brauchte 10 Minuten, um das Bier gnzlich ins Glas zu schtten. Mild malziger Antrunk ohne groen Tiefgang. Leicht herb werdend und bleibend, im Hintergrund scharf, etwas alkoholisch. Dennoch ist das Bier nur wenig aromatisch und kann das vorhandenen wrzige Potential nicht nutzen, einzig das Malz bildet zumindest eine solide Basis. Feinhefig zum Schluss, in der Intensitt weit unter dem Malz. Ein ungewhnlich mildes Bier. 13/8/7/7/8/7
"
1," Red-copper color with large off-white head.  Aroma of biscuit malt and fruit with a flowery hop bouquet.  Taste echoes the aroma - very estery with a grape, dry finish.  This is what I think of when I imagine a Belgian in my head.  Great beer.
"
1," Best beer from Chimay that i have tried. Very tasty beligan beer with amber/brown cloudy color. Well balanced. Very strong but cannot taste alcohol.  Man those monks know what they are doing. One of my favorites. Good anytime of year
"
1, bottle		Reviewed on
1," The waitress brought it out in a pint glass from the tap.  The appearance was somewhat murky brownish amber with a thin head.  The aroma was hoppy and reminded me of fresh cut hay.  The taste was extremely dry and quite bitter.  There were hints of roasty graininess, citric tartness, and some sourness.  It was light and watery in its mouthfeel and did not taste like a beer suitable for an ocean voyage halfway around the world.  My overall impression was that this was a fresh crisp beer that lacked much complexity and backbone to justify the moniker of an IPA; this was more like a west coast pale ale with some generous dry hopping.
"
1," bottle-thanks to vyvvy for the sample.  pours deep brown, almost black with a soapy, big bubble brown head that changes colors depending on the swirl in the glass.  aroma is big fresh roeasted coffee, cigar, char, dusty esters, dark chocolate-really smells tasty!  nice char and dark chocolate flavors.  lightly metallic finish which hinders the flavor profile here.  body is somewhat thin and watery.  this is a fairly good oatmeal stout that would really rock fresh on tap!
"
1," JAN 2, 2010 Tried 3 separate times.  Chilled poured from a bottle.  Its a medium amber ale with too much carbonation and head that does not last long.  Looks good in the glass, though slightly hazy, with the majority of bubbles forming from the bottom.  The aroma is very yeasty/doughy with a hint of hops.  The taste is relatively mild, slightly malty, and has a spicy / sweet character.  I was expecting a more complex Belgian but its not exceptional - good though.		Dont really get why this one is so highly rated.  Its just not that good IMHO.
"
1," Fruity smell, wonderful color.  I love the taste and finish, a very intersting ale.
"
1," MAR 16, 2004 Very nice. Deep amber color with a very large off-white head. Heavy clove, banana, and malt aroma. Clove, banana, malt and candy apple flavors. Moderate carbonation, with a fairly strong alcohol burn.
"
1," Pours russet, nearly opaque. The average head, composed of large bubbles, collapses into a lovely, creamy film. Aroma is strangely lacking...some yeast, cinnamon-rasin bread, and sugar. Subtle vanilla, madiera, and chutney notes emerge with time. Flavors of Dr Pepper (without the sweetness), sawdust, paper, and alkaline concrete dust. Very faint cinnamon and menthol elements surface as the beer warms. Some back-of-throat alcohol burn. Palate is light and gassy to the last sip. Unusual aftertaste of copper, nylon tent, and leathery boiled beef. I swear this beer was tons better last time I had it; today, it tastes very oxidized.
"
1," I like the champagne mouthfeel of Chimays brews.  This one is light on flavor, however.  Trappist light?  Good to give to friend who arent serious beer lovers.
"
1," Bottle from Markgrafen Getrnkemarkt, BambergBeautiful amber color, dark, with generous head. The caramel aroma has some sweetness and also some light cereals, and vanilla. Smooth and soft mouthfeel, caramel flavor, moderate sweetness, very light vanilla touch; low bitterness, with a very light impression of liquorice. A fair brew.
"
1," JUL 12, 2008 Hazy maroon under a tan froth.  Spicy and sweet nose of cola, anise, basil and ginger snaps.  Boldly flavoured; biscuits and treacle clang against an earthy herbal bitterness that lingers into an alcohol dry finish.  Quite fluffy due to the carbonation with a creamy texture.		Lacks finesse and cohesion.  		33 cl bottle, best before 2013.		Update, 02-09-2007.  33cl bottle, Duvel tulip, bbe 2012.  Hazy brown hue with reddish highlights, covered by a moderate-sized tan head consisting of very large bubbles, which is quite short-lived.  Lots of cola in the aroma, followed by brown sugar, dates, rhubarb, prunes.   Hm, somewhat medicinal as well (aspirin), blending into some dry, grassy hops.  Toasted bread with cherry jam.  Husky and tannic, also.  The flavour is somewhat better, lacking any real aspirin flavour, but still failing to really impress.  Moderately sweet from start to finish with high acidity, and a prickling, peppery finish.  Quite flat on the tongue, watery despite being medium-full in body, with prickling carbonation.  Not so impressive any more, no.		75 cL bottle, tulip glass.  Large, off-white head stays fairly well.  Body is a deep brown with a red hue.  Rich aroma is nutty, spicy, with a hint of alcohol.  Lightly sugary also.  Flowery hops; nutty toasted bread/grain malt; mold and cobweb yeast.  Moderately sweet throughout with light acidity and light bitterness at the end.  Warm spices play well off the sweetness.  Medium-heavy body is creamy with lively carbonation.  The bottom line is"
1," MAY 24, 2003 This beer poured a very dark amber color and formed a bubbly off white head that left trace lace. It had an aroma of malt, currents/plums and citrus. The flavor was of malt, caramel and cirtrus. The body has a nice slightly creamy aspect to it and the finish just hints at the alcohol and a slight carbonation feel to it. This by far the best of the Chimays and worthy of it's title Grand Reserve. Thanks again to the state to letting us Ohioians finally try this Belgium find.
"
1," Pours dark and cloudy but nearly as black as I expected. Palate was the best part of the beer. Smooth, lush, and full till the last drop even with the sediment at the bottom of the beer. Flavor wasnt as complex as I expected. Definitely as meal in a glass. Drank with a Chimay white and some Chimay Cheese that I found at Whole Foods. The Blue paired better with the cheese than the white. The flavors of the cheese and beer went amazingly well together. I didnt particularly like the cheese by itself. With the beer though it was amazingly. Highly recommended either way.
"
1," Deep golden, very stable creamy head, visible carbonation; solid aroma"
1," One of my favorites. Nice brown color with rich head. Flavor slightly reminds of coffee and brown sugar.
"
1," Dark muddy brown with a large fizzy light brown head. Aroma is dark fruity and yeasty with over ripe fruit basket, mostly plum, banana, apples, pears, and prunes. Very sweet flavor yet not syrupy or sticky, just good. Brown sugar, spices, plums, blackberries stand out. Packed with flavor.
"
1," The last bottle I had was perhaps a bit skunked.  It's hard to say.  I place this in the middle of the Chimay three.  I will rate based on past memories of the beer, more pleasant than this last bottle.
"
1," Clear amber colour. small head that lingers. light malty nose. bitter hoppy taste that fades quickly.
"
1,"		Surprisingly sweet but still not overly, it smells of dark roasted malts and a strong but very pleasant alcohol aroma to it. There is a fair bit of fruit to this one as well like dates and perhaps some fig. I also detected some brown sugar and vanilla as well but this seems to come and go. As the beer sits and gets a chance to open up a little some chocolate and spice become more pronounced as well. A very complex smelling beer & one that is great on the nose.		Pours a dark sort of reddish brown almost chestnut colour with a tan white head about two fingers width high. The head appears quite bubbly that stays put for quite some time before finally reducing to a thin lacing over the surface of the beer. It may have something to do with the fancy teku glass I poured it into but even after the head recedes this one still looks fantastic.		Again quite sweet upfront with a a faint alcohol kick to it that is part sugar, part spice. Some good chocolatey malts and hints of caramel along with the dark fruits noted in the smell. An amazing taste to this one with a malty sweetness and a great creamy taste added to the fact the beer is incredibly well balanced and tastes great.		Medium bodied and quite rich on the palate with medium carbonation. It is really smooth and goes down much easier than a 9% beer should. There is still a solid alcohol kick to it and the finish is relatively light in bitterness.		Simply amazing, this beer is without a doubt one of the best I have tried so far. It has great depth and an fantastic smell coupled with a solid feel and brilliant taste, its almost perfect. No doubt one that Ill find myself going back to time and time again, perhaps not quite as much as some slightly less rich beers but definitely a world class ale & one that you should definitely try if you havent already. Ill be picking up a few more of these to cellar pretty soon.		Featured in my 1001 Beers to Try Before You Die Blog"
1," Smells sweet, yeasty, and full of alcohol. Dark brown Trappist Ale with quarter inch white foam head. Very smooth beer. Great roasted malt flavor. Best of all the Chimays. Awesome beer.
"
1," The pour is a very dark brown color, almost black, with some reddish highlights to it and a minimal tan head.		S"
1," (1pt 9.4 fl oz.)  Huge rollin head that sits atop a hazy brown pour.  Smells slighty of malt and very ripe fruit.  Wow.  A bubbly full mouhfeel.  A very nice well balanced taste.  I really enjoyed just looking at this one produce a wonderful full lacing and letting it warm.  Although alcohol was not present at the beginning of bottle it was rather obvious later.  I think Il run out and pick up the rest of the Chimay line.  Very good.
"
1," Murky orange-brown. Frankly this beer looks awful. Its rare for me to give a 2 for appearance. I dont have a word in my vocabulary to describe the aroma, though its one Ive noticed in several beers. Perhaps aspirin soaked in vinegar? Quite a lot of sourness in the taste, though its slightly better than what has gone before. And some marmite, I think. A little bitterness of the aspirin variety to follow.
"
1," On draught at the brewpub. Pours a hazy straw brown with few suds to retain a head or leave lacing. The nose is of light grain and corn. The flavors are far too subdued, very little to comment on with the exception of a tiny grain finish.  The palate is seltzery with a thin body and overactive carbonation. Unfortunately, this is the ""light"" beer they brew to match the major brewers, but it remains watery with no substance.
"
1," Another fine offering from Chimay.  Not as good as the Blue in my opinion, little too sweet and lost points for a strange mouthfeel.  Poured from a 750 mL bottle; a nice dark red with a large but short lived beige head.		Tasted sweet with hints of dried fruits and malt.  Sweet aftertaste.		Overall, another good Trappist, something Id like to have again.
"
1," bottle (22 oz thanks to sprinkle).....a thin very dark brown pour witha beige colored head....the nose was made up of chocolate, molasses, and not too much in the way of being aged in whiskey barrels. a touch of vanilla....flavors of roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, very subtle vanilla and pretty thin overall.  wish the barrel aging showed up a little more.
"
1," (Draught)  Pours a pinkish red body with a small off-white head.  Aroma of cherries, wood, and caramel.  Flavor of lacto, cherries, earth, and subtle minerals.

1," Earthy and mellow.
"
1," Cask (handpump) @ Blackfriars, 36 Bell St, Merchant City, Glasgow G1 1LG, Scotland.Clear medium to dark red orange color with a small, fizzy - virtually none, fair lacing, fully diminishing, off-white head. Aroma is moderate malty, caramel, berry, prune, moderate hoppy. Flavor is moderate to heavy sweet and bitter with a long duration. Body is medium full to medium, texture is oily, carbonation is flat to soft. [20090410]
"
1," Draught during my NC brew tour. This is definitely a true American lager. Its very light in every aspect with the most assertive note being that of cardboard. Par for the brewpub light beer course.
"
1," bottle. toffee brown.  nose is wet, soggy caramel malt and dank, moldy leaves.  thin, flabby, watery but still chewy.  resinous harsh caramel malt.  a terrible idea.
"
1," Bottle courtesy of tytoanderso	Pours black with a lasting creamy brown head.  Smell is strong and of wet coffee grounds almost exclusively.  Nice coffee flavor, and a bit of milk like creaminess as well, yet body is still a touch thinner than ideal.  Very nice all around, with a strong coffee flavor.  Id recommend this for coffee beer lovers.
"
1," Hoppy, spicy, slight alcohol aroma.Soft dry yeasty nutty toffee flavors followed by dark fruits.mild hop finish.A fine easy to find Trappist ale but a bit too refined compared to other examples.
"
1," Pours a hazy copper color, with a large frothy off white head.  Very attractive aroma, malty with nice fruitiness.  Good amount of carbonation, kind of a spicy fruit flavor, very nice bitter ending.  A wonderful beer, many thanks to my brother for sharing this beer with me.
"
1," bottle - Pours copper with a big fluffy head and a pretty good hop aroma.  The flavor seems lacking though with flat, rather off tasting hops joined by mild malts in an overly thin brew.  A dry finish ends this so-so offering from Barley Island.
"
1," This was one for me that was hard to track down.  Everyplace that I went to that had this on the menu where out of it.  I happened to find it at a SAQ in Hull.  I am glad that I did because this is one hell of a beer.
"
1," 750 mL bottle.  Deep translucent chestnut brown, with far less head than I expected.  Fruit (apples), bread, and alcohol.  Bread with strawberry jam, to be specific.  Taste is simpler than expected.  Some brown sugar sweetness.  Maybe apple pie with cinnamon.  Quite heavily carbonated, but still a substantial mouthfeel.  A bit of bitterness at the end.  Taste lingers on the sides of the tongue.  Quite tasty.
"
1," FEB 4, 2007 Ive had it a bunch before but never rated it.  Pours amber with a nice robust head.  the taste is strong and tasty, but not super memorable.
"
1," Dark beer, thin brown head.  Aroma is of chocolate and alcohol, but flavour is bitter, malty, chocolate aftertaste.  Palate is unpleasant.  Not too much flavour, and flavour doesnt match the aroma, nor do they even compliment each other.  not necessarily offensive but not amazing in any way.
"
1," chocolate, dough, floral	APPEARANCE"
1," Cloudy brown body with a superb foamy beige head. Moderated aroma with some light spices like clove and vanilla, some banana and citrus. Smooth mouthfeel, banana and fruity taste with some spicy clove, nice lemony flavor. Minimal roasted characfter in the aftertaste, fine.
"
1," 12oz bottle pour. leaves the bottle damn near black and with a minimal tan head. looks really nice in the glass! roasted malts, coffee beans and some chocolate hit your nose. the texture is creamy and full bodied. you pick up on some roasted coffee flavor and chocolate but neither are overpowering. very tasty.
"
1," Pour from a  12 oz bottle. Hazy yellow brew with a humungous head that slowly flattens. Crisp, wheaty aroma with citrus overtones. Refreshing sweet and sour flavor with a slightly bitter finish. Crisp and refreshing but not light and watery. A very decent wheat ale.
"
1," Ive had the blue the white and now this and all are pretty nice.  The white is my personal fav, but this will do.  Nice flowery/bread aroma with a throat heavy experience.  Not exactly what I want but it beats most crappy belgian imitations.
"
1," Poured a light brown and coppery color, quite transparent and bubbly. Had a thick head that dissipated fairly quickly. It smelled of fruit, hops, some malt and a slight bit of grass. Its taste had a very smooth and moderately strong malt profile, seemed like mediums to dark roasts. It was slightly sweet and tasted of fruit and had a fairly strong bitter hop finish, but not as strong as an IPA. This was a good beer, darker flavor than I expected. It lacked the complexity youd expect but it is very smooth.
"
1," Gift pack from LCBO, second one tried. Pours murky brown, with a medium sized tan head. Aroma is mostly fruity with some spice and malt. Flavour is what youd expect; fruity, sweet and quite smooth.
"
1," Until I went to Belgium this beer was my number one.  I still rate it very high but Westvleteren outstrips it.
"
1," i had high hopes when i poured this one- it looked good.  nice fluffy head and a hazy amber orange pour.  some floral character.  some citrusy hops. .  it was ok.
"
1," Pulled this one out after completing my A & P final to celebrate. 		Man, this is one beautiful beer.  Wonderful dark, reddish-brown color with one of those thick fluffy heads that takes forever to calm down.  This thing is fizzing like a Coke or something.		A hint of fruitiness in the aroma with an underlying aroma of yeast and malt.  Not quite as strong as an aroma as I would expect after the beautiful appearance, but not unpleasant either. 		Very smooth wonderful taste.  Lots of raisin, maybe some figs, definitely a wine aspect to this.  Nice burn on the way down to let you know the alcohol is there as well.  Very nice beer.  		Definitely one of the top Belgians Ive ever had.  It looks good, tastes good, and is good.
"
1," Dirty, dark brown color.  Medium body & texture.  Smells of light malts.  Slight hoppy taste, also very faint caramel taste.  Almost no bitterness.  Not bad, but nothing special here.
"
1," JUL 22, 2011 Bottle. Hazy redish brown with a big light brown head that falls to almost nothing leaving some lacings. Aroma is raw roasted malty, yeast, brown sugar, dark bread and a slight hint of almond paste in the background. Not as sweet as suspected.	Taste is sweeter. Roasted malts, butterscotch, dark bread, some syrup, some dark fruit and a certain bitterness. Alcohol is warming. Carbonation is wild. Body is big.	So far I cant see its greatness. One day I suppose...
"
1," I got this one in Indianapolis. The body was dark brown. The aroma was caramel and chocolate with some pancakes. The taste was pancakes with coffee and chocolate. Well made, but a little boring.
"
1," 750 in to a chalice pours a deep copper with a light haze and an off white chunky head.  The mild aroma is both earthy and a little bit sweet and fruity.  The taste is again mildly sweet, balanced with clean bitter hops and a little yeasty sour.  	The fairly high carb creates a lingering head but without a lot of lacing, and also some truly satisfying belches.  More strikingly, it creates a mouthfeel that is similar to champagne bubbles dancing across your tongue that enhances an underlying and (I hate to say) delightful pepperiness.	This is a sentimental favorite.  Chimay Red is the beer that convinced me that there really is more out there and had to be my first rating.  I dont know if there will be many more ratings, but there will be many more beers.  Thanks to all of the hardworking monks at Scourmont Abbey!

1," Pours a cloudy, unfiltered brown with an off-white head which almost fades completely but sustains itself if you swirl it around. Flavor has notes of raisin, white wine, apple, cherry, clove, banana and some caramel/toastiness. Well balanced. Medium to full bodied on the palate with that airy, soft yet very lively Chimay carbonation. Not my favorite style but a well made beer overall.
"
1," Bottled. Golden coloured. Sweet malty aroma with a fruity touch. Sweet and light flavour with fruity notes and some bitterness in the finish. Thin and slightly metallic.
"
1," Dark brown colour, lasting off-white head. Nutty, malty nose. Very complex body. Taste of nuts and malt dominates. Slightly bitter and long finish.
"
1," OCT 27, 2008 Pours dark red with a sizeable head.  Aroma is malty and floral.  Flavor is complex but not as much as that of the bleu.  Mouthfeel is very nice.  Finish is exceptionally dry.  Satisfying, but not as impressive as the grand reserve.
"
1," This beer makes me weep!  Perfectly blanced and easily drinkable even with the higher ABV.  Sweet and slightly hoppy, totally refreshing...what a good beer should be.
"
1," Smells library and sweet. All sorts of things going on in the flavor. Grapey, leathery, marmalade, Keeps going back and forth between sweet and earthy, musty and bright. Feels like whipped cream. Just dissolves. 		Not my favorite flavor, but love how it melts in your mouth.
"
1," 03 or 04 Bottle.  Nice brown/red color with big head.  Lots of the Belgian yeast in the aroma, nice and spiced, with some fruits.  More of the yeast and sweet malts and fruits in the flavor, and an appropriately thick mouthfeel.

"
1," This poured a dark amber, nice thick head, that diminished, but left rocky peaks all the way down, smell was fruity and complex. The taste is more like drinking Champagne due to the carbonation. Not my favorite of the Chimay line, but still a decent beer.

1," Hazy, chestnut coloured, mid-sized, fluffy and stable off-white to reddish head; big fruity (dried fruit) nose, cloves, and a tinge of sweet malts and alcohol; sweet full flavour, quite full bodied; slightly sweet-bitter, fruity and a bit tart finish with an illusion of a Ruby-Port. Well quaffable and deceptive..................
"
1," Bottle. Plenty of fruity esters in the aroma. Bananas in 2% milk topped with sugar. Dry grassy yeast. Pours dark, hazy orange with a fizzy white head. Flavor is pleasant with a lot of yeast. Quite dusty. Some figs and raisins but the yeast component is big. Medium to full bodied with mouth filling carbonation. Oh... to find a Dubbel that I like.
"
0," Swing-top bottle (courtesy of Bierkrug).  Brown sugar and cherry malt aroma.  Clear dark brown color with nice tan head.  Slightly sweet brown sugar malt  - lightly smokey finish.  This beer is hard to put a label on but regardless, a very nice beer.
"
1," had fresh. aroma is lots of roasted malts, nutty sweetness, some bourbon/alcohol. drinks with an alcohol bite but has sweet malts, caramel, brown sugar, rich red fruits and spice. finishes hot with alcohol. will have to re-rate after some age.
"
1," Very similar to Chimay Red. All those wonderful flavors and aromas swirling in my glass.
"
1," Growler.  Opaque brown with small head.  Bitter coffee aromas, with some sweet cola chocolate notes.  Sweet chocolate malt flavors, with coffee.  Thin and watery unfortunately, which was the big killer for me.

"
1," light roast, coffee, some chocolate in the aroma and flavor, although the flavor was fairly watery and slightly sour/citrusy? Mouthfeel was thin within style. Drinkable, but not stellar.
"
1," Pours very nicely with a frothy, light amber head.  Very nice fruity scent reminiscent of raisins or dates.  Nice yeasty flavor with malty undertones.  Flavor stays light to medium on the tongue with just the right amount of carbonation. Finishes

"
1," 650ml bottle poured brown in color with about 2 fingers of off-white head which left some spotted lacing on the side of glass.  Aroma is chocolate and mint.  Taste is light malty sweetness with chocolate and mint.  This is a pretty good brew with a light to medium body and light carbonation.
"
1," Draft. Golden with an off-white head. Hop aroma. Slightly bitter on the palate. Pretty good.
"
1," This beer has a lot going for it, but one thing that really sets it back in my book.  Its too carbonated... I actually shook a bit of the carbonation ouit and it did tastew better.  I recently had Ommegang and actually liked it better.  I am saddened because I was quite excited to try this beer.  It was fine, but had a strong alcohol nose and flavor that seemed to overwhelm the complex flavor at times.  This is certainly good, but I couldnt rate it the best in its class.
"
1," Nice brownish orange pour with an off-white head, strong alcohol and fruit, alcohol is well hidden, a bit spicy, this beer finishes very well with zero bitterness.
"
1," On tap.  Initial fruity taste with a sour/bitter bite.  Mellowed a little after the first drink.  Pretty good overall.
"
1," NOV 18, 2011 Small bottle, 2010. Rusty brown body with a tall head. Hoppy aroma with some toffee. Taste has a lot going on"
1," On tap in the United States.  Poured a cloudy orange, with tan head.  Slight yeasty aroma.  Slightly biscuity, like shortbread with some sweetness.  Subtle hop bitterness, and maybe some toffee or carmel in there.  Complex flavor, went down smooth.  Would go well with cheese and lots of other foods.
"
1," elegant enough to show off with a fuente opus X cigar! The best meal ive had in weeks.
"
1," Its unclear golden with a huge, white and creamy head. The aroma is inviting whit notes of banana, yeast and wheat. The sweet flavour has notes of yeast/clove, banana FAT banana, light wheat and the finish is spicy. Its extremely well-balanced and just like I prefer my weissbier!
"
1," Bottle. Pours a dark amber/brown colour with lasting ""red-ish"" head. Aroma and taste is liqourice & caramel notes. Great colour. Great taste. Pure trappist. Love it.
"
1," pours dark with a decent head. aroma is complex combo of riasins and prunes and things like that. taste is similar, nice and balanced, some citrus notes. body was a little lighter than i thought. but this was a great beer anyhow
"
1," Light citrusy aroma and flavor with a decent malt background. Finishes with a touch of fruitiness followed by a lingering dry bitterness.
"
1," Even without the yeast the body is extremely hazy, opaque shade of brick red and pumpkin orange. Forms a normal-sized, yellowish sudsy head which retains well but doesnt lace.Smell"
1," [bottle frompeckhams] redy oak colour, medium head,smells of liquorice and raisins. Medium body with a bitter finish.
"
1," Had one half glass at friends...very cloudy pale amber vanilla and heavy clove aroma, clover and phenolic flavor, borderline pleasant to strong, worth trying if you see it
"
1," this was my first experience with the chimays and i was more than pleasantly surprised. served in a goblet showcasing a nice fluffy cream head, the beer was a clear deep yellow. lots of aroma with a bit of a floral scent. mostly malt with a citrus finish. very fine beer.
"
1," Bottle.  Reddish brown much like the label with a nice white head.  Aroma of ripened dark fruit, molasses, caramel malt, and belgian yeast.  Flavor is mostly sweet with just the slightest touch of tanginess.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with over average carbonation and finishes very well.  Great beer and very much enjoyed.
"
1," Hazy brown colour. Pale brown head fast dissappearing. Softy and malty nose. Sweet taste with some prunes. Also some sourness in the taste. Some hoppiness in the end. A small bottle from Alko shop.
"
1," A nice pour from the start, fruity, slightly bitter, nice spiciness to it, a great drinking beer, not my favorite from Chimay, but still a world class brew.
"
1," On tap at the Walt Disney World Boardwalk location. Pours a dark amber color with a nice white head on top. Aroma is full of malt with hints of hops and caramel coming in. Flavor is full of caramel with hops coming in to make the beer not overly sweet. The 2nd best beer out the short sampling I had. I love the Honey Dijion Chicken Sandwich at this place though!
"
1," Ahhh... afternoon beer!	Poured out a small light tan head that has pretty good retention and some random lacing, nice brown body. Well, I really had to let this warm for the aroma to seep out. Roasted malts, dusty chocolate, weak (thankfully) but coffee that is noticeable in the background. Comes across somewhat flavourless and Ive noticed that quality before in Browns. Roasted malts, some berry sweetness, mild hops. Then, sometimes I get a bunch of flavour if I look. Finishes nice with drying cardboard bitterness. Needs work.
"
1," Corked bottle is the only way to have this, my favorite ale from the region besides Castelain Blonde Bier de Garde.  I found nothing offensive about this every time Ive had it, except that once the bottle is empty I wish there was more ;)  Expensive, but worth every penny and it can be found pretty easily.
"
1,"	The softest of mouthfeels showcases this brews toasted cereals, themselves cushions that propel a seductive spicy hop perfume.		Further Personal Perceptions"
1," (draft 7/30/10). Clear copper color. Medium off white head. Moderate citrus aroma with light acetaldahyde. Flavor of the same. Avg duration. Light bitter finish. Slick texture. Moderate carbonation. Fair lacing.
"
1," The appearance was fooling.  Enjoyed this flavorful beer.  Plan to buy again.
"
1," Sample at the Brewpub downtown Chattanooga. Light pour with a thin head that does not last. Grassy dry hardly any taste. I do like beer, really! But this round of Big River Samples is not doing it for me. Ok back to the rateing. A hint of bitterness and could use more. God I hope the wings I ordered are good. Moving on!
"
1," Easily my favorite Chimay, though I also am a huge fan of the white.  For those of us who have a hard time finding beer (you cant sell over 6% in AL) this is a godsend, of course I suppose its that way for most anyway.  Lots of subtle flavors, and really most people manage to pick out different aspects.  Also I love how the trappists have a nice warming effect.  Makes me want to drink this in an oversized button-tucked leather sofa chair next to an open fire.
"
1," Golden, OK head. The aroma has notes of malt and hops and the flavour is full, sweetish, malty with notes of caramel, honey and hops. Its a smooth taste with enough, but not much bitterness...
"
1," spicy, with tastes of apples and pears - sweet and creamy. Slight sharp aftertaste. A great drink!
"
1," MAR 6, 2011 i asked for the hoppiest thing they had and got this on 7/18/10.		reddish tinted brown pour/caramel with a creamy off white head.		it smells biscuity... mixed with caramel, toasty malt, nuts, faint chocolate and spice.		the flavor mirrors the aroma with a nice crisp hoppy finish. it is clean and fairly satisfying. 6/3/6/3/14/3.2	 can from the brewery rating holds except it is on the fuller side, very creamy and soft. 6/3/6/4/14/3.3
"
1," Poured a deep red hazy amber. had a medium sized fine head that quickly thinned to a small head. Fruity aroma. Fruity flavor with hint of grapes and cherries. Very smooth drinking with fruity aftertaste. This is my favorite of the Chimays(over the bleu)
"
1," From a 660 ml bottle.  Pale yellow, slightly cloudy with a thin head and some lacing.  Aroma is of clove and coriander with some citrus over an unusual malt smell.  Seems like this is mostly barley malt rather than wheat.  Huge orange flavour with a good amount of coriander in the finish.  Crisp finish with a slightly bready aftertaste.  A pretty good brew.
"
1," Bottle 750ml.Clear medium yellow orange color with a average to large, frothy, good lacing, fully lasting, off-white head. Aroma is moderate malty, grain, toasted, moderate hoppy, dry grass, light pepper. Flavor is moderate to light heavy sweet and bitter with a long duration, peppery, grass bitter, hoppy, metallic. Body is medium, texture is oily, carbonation is soft. [20101024]
"
1," Pours orangy brown with a thick, frothy, off-white head. Standard but pleasant spicy and fruity aroma. Flavor is quite spicy, fruity notes with citrus like acidity, and slight bitternss towards the finish. Palate is light/medium, effervescent, with lingering spice, a hint of sweetness, and light bitterness. Not that complex, but well-balanced, easy drinking, and enjoyable
"
1," [330ml bottle, Peckhams Stockbridge, Edinburgh] Gusher on opening  seems to happen a fair bit with Chimay beers. Huge head from the gush, deep rusty brown pour. Slight caramel notes on the aroma, plenty of sweet fruity malt in evidence. Slightly bitter taste, some woodiness, mostly caramel malt. Slightly sour aftertaste. Really good drinker, particularly for 7% [04102007]
"
1," Light malt nose and dark amber color. Full taste with	a dry finish. Sophisticated by very smooth. The fine	bubbles contribute to a wonderful texture. Though very	special, I can drink this all day long.  Has rightfully	earned its status.
"
1," Pours a light cola brown with little head. Initial aroma of apples and cloves, moving into dark cherries and yeast. Very high carbonation, much like Piraat it drinks like a champagne. Flavor makes those apples and cloves turn darker, moving toward raisins and malts and intensifying the cherries. A good solid complex Belgian, but nothing to write home about - it doesnt pack the punch I like in a strong Belgian.
"
1," Bottle.  Fluffy white head, dark red color, almost dark tea color.  Sweet smell light wheat and fruit notes.  Fast beginning with small wheat flavor.  Quick fizzy middle with wheat, fruits, and sweetness.  Sharp dry aftertaste with silght alcohol flavor.  Very goob balance between sweetness, bitterness, fruits, & wheat, not overpowering but could use more.
"
1," Bottled. Slightly hazy orangeish golden colour with small white fluffy head. Aroma is bready malts, some earth, mild biscuits as well as some herbal notes. Flavour is sweet malts, some earth, bisquits and a bit bready notes as well. Quite dry palate. Nice late bittery dryness.
"
1," Ample brownish head that diminishes rapidly.  The color is a very dark and cloudy brown.  The flavor is sweet and malty, and has very little presence of hops.  The alcohol content is very apparent in the flavor, and the carbonation is ample and enjoyable.
"
1," JUN 26, 2006 In the bomber bottle. Dark brown in color. No alcohol to nose. Smells like raisins. Nice slow burn to the sip. Tastes like raisins. Big mouth flavor. A very fine big beer. I drank this with a center-cut filet mignon at Charlies Steakhouse in Orlando. Big beer, big meat.	UPDATE 6/5/6"
1," NOV 2, 2007 11 ounce bottle purchased at Total Wine Fort Lauderdale, FL. $3.79 Excellent!
"
1," Bottle. Reddish brown with large brownish head. Very sparkly. Sweet and malty. Notes of dried fruit. A bit to mild though.
"
1," Bottle.  Pours mostly clear brown with a creamy beige head.  Yeasty, malty nose.  Nice full mouthfeel.  Sweet malts, spices, bread last into the finish.
"
1," Dark brown colour with some slight ruby highlights. A thin tan head tops the beer. Aroma of coffee and roasted malt. Medium-bodied; Strong coffee flavour with some caramel sweetness and roasted malt all being major players. Aftertaste bittered from the malt. Overall, a pretty good Stout and fairly representative of the style. I had this on draught at Big River (owned by Gordon Biercsh) in Chattanooga, Tennesse on 26-September-2003.
"
1," Poured amber in color with tall light tan head and typical Belgium level of carbonation (medium-high). Spicy yeasty  hoppy aroma with a bit of malt. Taste is a balance of sweet malts and spice influence that initially gives it a slight medicine taste. The following tastes had more fruit notes like grapes and cherries. It ends with a nice light malty aftertaste.
"
1," Bottle 75 cl. A hazy redish and bown body. A nice and light fruity and caramellish nose. The flavor is typpicaly belgian and I sense hits of fruits caramel and honey. The palet is kind of sparkeling and you sense the alcohol	A long lasting smooth finish
"
1," Deep, dark, musky fruitiness in the nose. Dark brown almost opaque colour with reddish tones. Generous and lasting tan head. Earthy, musty, yet sweet flavour. Strong alcohol in the finish that is entirely appropriate and never overwhelming. Excellent full body. Bottle.
"
1," Bottle. Amber color. Decent head. Not as good as the blue. But a decent beer.
"
1," Pours a chestnut color with a smaller, slow collecting pine white head. Smells of rich fruits and grains, with a sticky molasses and toast tint. Tastes of lightly of honey oat bread, dark fruits and nuts. Has a weak start, but continues through to a full, doughy mouth. Finishes rich and doughy.
"
1," As with most belgiums, yeast is the thing.  Very aromatic.  Semi sweet with a spice of nutmeg, pepper and herbs.
"
1," Bottle. Pours dark dark hazy amber with reasonable white bubbly head which did not hang aroud for long. Plenty going on in the aroma, most notible is dried fruit and caramel. This transfers through to the flavour with a dry finish. Mouthfeel a little light for the style. Alcohol barely noticable, this is one that will sneak up on you.
"
1," Piss colored, topped by a medium thick head with a surprisingly good amount of lacing.  Its weak and watery with a hayey, grassy bitterness.  Light bodied and dry.
"
1," Pours a transparent dark copper with a thin, wispy white head.  Aroma of sweet toasty dark caramel and a touch of milk chocolate and Belgian yeast.  Body starts lightly sweet and toasty dark caramel malty with mild complexity and some drier doughy bready balance in the finish.  A nice dark Belgian brew.
"
1," Great beer. Top Shelf status. The smell of the brew is so great. It has so many flavors I cant explain. Good stuff.
"
1," MAR 13, 2004 Light brown diminishing head. Dark borwn colour. Sweet/malt aroma with notes of chocolate, spice(coffee-ish)... age lends cookie, rum and raisins to the aroma. Sweet taste, slightly bitter. The new version is a little too sharp - it's stabbing my tongue!. When aged it gets more balanced and ""round"" with notes of raisins and rum also appearing in the taste. Cork aroma and taste can get pronounced. (when aged for approx. 5yrs"
1," Pours a cloudy brown with a medium light brown head.  Mellow aroma.  Light fruits and some caramel.  Not very bold.  Not very complex.  The taste is much of the same.  Very watery mouthfeel, light bitter sweetness.  Not very tasty.  Dont have much else to say about this beer.  Unsatisfied.
"
1," Very active carbonation, dark reddish-brown color, head stays thick forever.  Very smooth and easy to drink, alcohol taste quite noticeable.  Overall, an excellent and very accessible strong Belgian ale.
"
1," MAY 14, 2006 This beer is one of my personal Favorites.  I knew it was going to be great as soon as I poured it into the glass.  The head was wonderful and light. I usually am a fan of a little bit more of a smoother beer like a lot of wheat beers are but this beer made me re-evaluate my opinion of what a beer should be.  The taste was very full and had a little bit of bite, but the aftertaste was sensational.  I have yet to try the Chimay Grand Reserve, this beer puts the Chimay white label to shame.  Much smoother and far better tasting.
"
1," The expiration date has passed for 4 weeks. THIS crown cap is a real eye-catcher! In the glass is a dark brown-yellow brew, which loses its head in seconds. Very similar to a peach ice tea. The smell is very malty, similar to a (bavarian) Blockmalz candy.It starts caramel-roasted malty. Mixed with a little toffee in the background. The aftertaste is malty and spicy, subtly sweet.
"
1," A bit hazy golden colored beer, with a nice white foamed head. The aroma isnt very strong, a bit spicey, some fruits and hoppy. The taste is mild, notes from malt, hop and fruits. A good triple, but not my favorite.
"
1," From a bottle this poured a rich brown with a fat tan head that left great rings of lacing in my Chimay glass.  Rich nose of malts, fruit, yeasts, and caramel.    Great rich and oily mouthfeel...about as good as it gets. Flavor is of malts and hops in perfect balance.  Finish is slightly bitter and hides the alcohol well.  A wonderful brew.
"
1," 16 oz. bottle in trade from douglas88- thanks!  Served in shaker- poured transparent yellow with copper tint, one finger white head formed, tried to lace, and tried to stay, but was unsuccessful at both attempts.  Aroma of wheat, grass, and corn.  Hits the mouth with a thin watery body, some malt, some corn, a little sweetness with hops on the background on the finish.
"
1," This is the first Trappist and the first Belgium beer Ive ever had.  Pour was nice, tons of head.  I had to wait 3-4 minutes before I could complete the pour, and drink.  Color is dark copper, and I picked up wood and cherry hints.  There was so much hype on this beer, on the first 2 to 3 drinks I liked it, but I was not overly impressed.  By the time I was half way done, this had become one of my favorite beers of all time.  This is the absolute smoothest beer I have ever had.  I enjoy hops, I enjoy the sharpess, the bite, the citrus, everything about a good hoppy brew.  But this... This is is just so smooth.  There is no bite, an extremely drinkable beer.  I had someone who cant stand beer try it, and they liked it.  This beer appeals to the masses, I look forward to trying more Trappists beers.
"
1," Shared, thanks to beastiefan2k.  Brown pour with reddish hint.  The aroma has some dark fruit, sweet malt, and candy sugar.  The flavor starts with lightly roasted malt, with sugar and floral / earthy spices.  Interesting beer.
"
1," Bottle, 33 cl. Aroma seemed to have some skunk in it, a problem Ive also encountered with other triples...not sure if thats just coincidence or these brews are particularly sensitive to...something...anyway, otherwise some vague fruits/spices, nothing of particular, note. Flavor I think was best described by Odense below as more herbal than other tripels, which I agree was a nice change of pace, also a nice hop presence, particularly in the finish. Still, nothing wowing. Decent brew, I just havent been impressed by tripels recently.
"
1," A very tastefull full bodied and not to strong nice trappist beer. Really better as most of the American beers i tasted in a L.A. pub. They had the 3 trapisst beers of chimay on large bottle. And I drunk a chimay just before coming back to Belgium. Really a must for all beer raters
"
1," 330mL 2003 bottle. Wow! This stuff blows me away. The aroma is fantastic, its hard to pull away from my nose. Floral, yeasty, malty...its just so wonderful. 	Flavour seems to be quite malty, but then it pretty much balances itself out. Its quite thick and yeasty, super-smooth, and complex.		9% alcohol is completely masked as opposed to some other belgian strong ales. 		Awesome stuff.
"
1," Half-liter bottle, $1.50 @ Binnys Bolingbrook. Let us now tick off Armenia just because I found a bottle cheap. Let us also be politically incorrect by prying the cap with an Efes bottle opener. Yeek! Smell of skunk and piss in the green bottle. Doesnt let up in the glass, but instead airs out some adjuncts. Still, a clear golden yellow with a tight white head. Well, what did I expect for the price. Taste is corn additives knocked back with bittering agents. Each swallow makes me worry about this stuff. I notice the label doesnt go to the pretext of reprinting any medals from old beer festivals.
"
1, Murky medium brown color. Two plus fingers of super creamy light tan head with great retention and good amounts of lacing. Very good so far.		3.5 S

"
1," (Chimay Premire in corked 75 cl. bottle)	Herby-malty nose with depth.	White head of foam, fading but with medium consistancy, some cloudiness (yeast in suspension, bottle had been laid down), dark amber color, little fizz.	Herby-malty taste, with volume, good foam in the mouth, some licorice, very good medium-intense herbaceous finish without bitterness nor stickyness.	This is very good, tastes like artisanal (as against industrail).  The lower third of the bottle was full of floating yeast cells, turned it into a creamy rich tasting ..food.. brew, very good indeed.  My score is no doubt conservative.
"
1," Burning wood, hugely fuity (peach), smoked aroma. Opaque orange-tan coloured, heavy, still and viscous looking with no head at all. Charred blackened, salted peach flavour. Palate is oily, heavy and still. A very interesting experiment. I glad to have had the chance to try this, but after the initial few sips, I found this difficult to consume. Bottle (plastic) enjoyed with DYCSoccer17, MartinT, muzzlehatch, Omhper and Rastacouere.
"
1," Fameuse bire ! Lalcool est parfaitement dos avec le houblon et sa couleur frole la perfection. Elle mrite le top belge!

1," Some caramelly maltiness; yoghurty flavours.
"
1," Standard lager color, medium white head. Strongly hoppy and flowery aroma with mild fruits and sweetness, nice one. Medium bodied. Hopped, strongly fruity and flowery flavor, medium hopped dry ending with floral aftertaste. Nice pilsner.
"
1," Bottle shared by my friend Matt. Pours dark amber with some red hues, and a nice creamy off white head. Aroma of yeast, brown sugar, and dark fruits. Medium mouthfeel and very earthy mineral like texture. Flavor is moderately sweet, with notes of yeast and plums. Mild bitterness to balance it out, with some faint astringency. Not overly complex, but well crafted and enjoyable.
"
1," Pours brown hue with a tan somehat frothy but quickly vanishing head. Aroma nice malty smell with a small hint of vanilla. Taste is wonderful, a nice carbonation hits the tounge as the smooth like champange taste rolls in. Hints of grapes and malty wonderfulness, is the best descripiton I can give. Highly reommended.
"
1," Obtained in trade with atpayne, thanks Adam!) For a Belgian style wheat ale, this beer tastes awfully sweet and has a very clear presence of clove.  The usual assortment of witbier flavors, the wheat, the coriander, the orange peel are all here, but lag behind the sweetness and the clove by a fair amount.  There is a slight bitterness extending the finish, helping to offset the sweetness.  The nose still shows plenty of clove, but is less sweet and more balanced, with funk and wheat having more interplay with the spices.  Light-medium bodied, gently carbonated, soft and easy on the palate.  Half an inch of white, tightly-knit head sits atop the hazy, light golden body.  Highly unusual for the style, sweet, clovy, minimizing the coriander, it seems like a girlie version of witbier, no offense to the girls who like a more classic examples of the style.  That said, its still pleasant enough to be an easy quaffer.
"
1," Pours a cloudy red oak with a foamy off-white head.  The flavor has hints of fruityness and leaves a heavy taste on the back center of the tongue. There is some bitterness but is complimented nicely with the hints of fruit sweetness .  An enjoyable drink.
"
1," Dutch Ratebeer Meeting. Very light colored. The beer smells badly. Sweet and thin with rice and apple. Drain pour!
"
1," Pours a absolutely beautiful reddish color.  The fluffy head on this beer is really icing on the cake of one of the best looking beers ive ever seen.  Cloudy to show that its unfiltered.  It smells of fruit and malts mostly.  Flavors are much like the smell would lead you to believe.  Its somewhat fruity and malty but has an excellent balance to it.  The mouthfeel is incredible very smooth and finishes great.  I cant wait to try the blue and other offerings from this monestary.
"
1," Bire cuivre sur lie, lgrement trouble avec un gnreux col beige mousseux.  De complexes armes herbacs, de gazon, de pomme verte, dalcool et mme de caf!  Bire plutt acide et lgrement minrale.  De corps moyen.  Texture lisse et plaisante avec une fin honnte.  Probablement agrable avec des repas pics et armatiques.
"
1," 12 oz bottle.  Pours a cloudy dark amber brown body under a small creamy off-white head that faded to a thin film that lasted for the duration.  Aroma is very fruity with some yeast, plum, raisins, light alcohol, caramel, and toffee.  Flavor is similar to aroma up front, fruity with some toffee and caramel notes.  Yeast, light alcohol, and some risidual sweetness on the finish.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with lots of fizzy foaming carbonation.  Finishes with a little light stickiness.  Overall, a pretty decent beer.  This was one of my first forays into ""better beer"" many years back, and I really thought that this was the shit.  I guess that I have grown alot, but still nice to see that it is a pretty solid brew.

1," 11.2 oz bottle.  Not much aroma here.  The little bit I do smell is of grains; slightly sour.  Pours muddy brown with little head.  Thin island of foam on top.  Excellent taste--maybe its a little old, though.  Not as good as the blue label, but still very good.
"
1," Shared a 75 cl bottle with a good friend at Zomerlust. Cellar-cold, it had timid head. Perhaps it had done some time in a cellar. It was neither outspoken fruity nor bitter, not sweet and sour neither. Some graininess in its mouth feel (dust). Modestly lasting after-taste. It is balanced and that goes hand in hand with less clear palate. Too high priced compared to the 33 cl version which seemed more tasty to me. Therefore, on memory, I give palate more than this bottle deserves, same with overall imp. Appearance can sure do better next bottle.
"
1," Aromas of spice (nutmeg, clove, anise) carmelized brown sugar fruits (raisin, orange, plum, banana) and a blue cheese like yeastyness. The nose is deep and alluring, strong and inviting. Some carmelly malt is present as well, but the floral spicy yeast dominates.		Flavor is like the best apple cider you ever had.  A woody malt start flows slowly into a rich fruity mid with carmelly finish.  A delicate and incredilbe transition of flavors, like really good scotch. The spices noted in the nose intermingle with rich dark fruit malts and elegant belgian yeast in a most pleasant balancing act.  You taste alchohol but its only one character in a complex mingle.		Palate is equally complex and marked by smooth and definite transitions.  Mild tang and tingle build to sour character while the mouth becomes increasingly silkly. After goin thro a dry phase there is a  sweet whisper of a finish, slightly sticky mouth, like you just ate a nectarine.		I dont use perfect as a description very often because I want to leave the perfect beer out there as an unattainable ideal, but this beer is damn near perfect. Its because of beer like this that so many american belgian style ales fail miserably.

1," Bottle.  Pours a dark mahogany with a thin caramel color head which quickly disapates. Powerful aroma of sweet roasty malt.  Creamy texture that lasts.  Big time flavors with chocolate, vanilla, coffee all nicely balanced.  Thanks Em!

1,"  	This Amber Ales dryish, svelte body exhibits toasty Munich malt subtleties and leafy, earthy hops for a very drinkable brew with plenty of nuances to keep you interested throughout the pint. 		Further Personal Perceptions "
1," Bottled. Amber coloured. Unclear. Dense beige head. Aroma of sourness, fruits, grape. Flaovur of sweet sourness, citrus, fruits, light spice. Medium bodied. Dry sour grapyness in the end. thx Kim for sharing.

1," 08-99 bottling date; mid-July 02 tasting notes. Yeeeeeeeiiiiiiiikkkkkkesss! Intense vanilla ice cream sweetness, then linseed oil, then figs, then pipe tobacco. Huge nose of sweetness and alcohol. The flavors were so wonderful that we opened the 2nd (and, sniff, last) bottle of the 08-99 bottling. No difference in the second bottle. The Trappists are geniuses!		Jim Anderson of the late Beer Philadelphia said drink in the 3rd or 4th year...."" Geeezuss, he sure was correct on this one!

1," shared @ xmas party, this is interesting, as listed belgian strong but beer was anything but, easy drinking light swirly mouthfeel with not a huge yeasty taste that i despise in so many other belgian strongs..ends with a velvety touch of malt... nice and easy well done chimay.
"
1," Draught at Siboire. Brown lingering foam that use N2. Dark brown color. Distink coffey aroma. Smooth taste to start then the burnt malts start to show and give a good bitter finnish.
"
1," While its difficult to rate low one of the beers that introduced me to the true beer community, I have to say it does not hold up to other similar in style.	I used to enjoy this immensely years ago, but the last several I tasted were not near the quality experienced in the past.  One bad one I can blame on poor handling by the liquor store, 3 in a row means I dont buy it again.
"
1,")  It smelled like swill, it looked like a pale nude color, and it had minimal foamy head.  The flavors were quite impressive, however, IMO.  Lots of that gumball wheat flavor I love, nice banana and clove, and malt character.  The flavor was almost chewable, but the palate was as thin as it looked.  A decent ballpark beer, and probably a decent summer brew, as its cool and refreshing with a good clean finish.
"
1," This ale is really excellent at covering the ABV.  Smooth going down.  A truly excellent work of an ale. ;)
"
0," Picked up a sixpack of this lager before the holiday weekend.  Poured a nice copper color with a nice level of head and carbonation. So far so good. 		The taste was sour, not terribly overwhelmingly sour but enough to question if I had gotten a bad bottle. I tried another bottle the following night -it was also bad. 		I contacted the brewery to ask about the off flavors. According to the brewery rep, sour is not an intended flavor in this beer! They offered to replace the six pack free of charge if I was in the area, and that they would like to investigate the problem. MN to NE is a little far to go for a sixer but the effort on the breweries part to correct the problem was promising. I did provide the bar code on the bottle so they could track the batch with their own records and hopefully determine what went wrong. Id like to try a fresh example someday.
"
1," 2003.Dark reddish brown.Big creamy head with some mohagany tones.Floral fruity spicey nose.Flavors were a little surprising here as I was expecting the same blast from this as I got from some other Belgians but the taste was much more subdued.Nothing that I would buy this again

1," ""Nice aroma of spicy red fruits, mild clove, yeast and cedar. Amber brown body with a lasting 1/2"" foamy head and solid lacing. Lots of tight, high energy carbonation.

Solid Belgian Ale, somewhat tame all around although its well put together.""

1," Small bottle. First time to rate this after drinking it many, many times. Nice caramel flavor, great balance. A very nice beer, though not truly amazing. Still a solid big Belgian.

1," Nice amber colors with a decent head.  Aroma of fruit and spice. Very well balanced flavor, with a hint of spices and malts. The alcohol is well hidden. I prefer the Bleu, but this is definitely worth a try.
"
1," APR 1, 2004 A dark beer with a lot of liquorice smell and taste. If there is something negative with this beer it is that the liquorice can be too dominating. Re-rating"
1," 6 pack purchased by jogringo, thanks man.  Pour is almost-clear rich copper color with a medium white head that quickly dissipates.  Aroma is hoppy and malty.  Hop component is mostly citrus with notes of resin and rosemary. Caramel malt provides a light sweetness with a slightly grainy component. Flavor is a well-integrated compilation of sweet caramel malt, light resinous hop, and cleansing citrus hop.  Maybe a touch thinner body than I was hoping for. Perfect way to relax down after moving most of the day.  Solid.
"
1," On tap at Big River Grille, Nashville.  Pours dark brown/red with nice head and good lacing.  Nice floral hoppy aroma.  Good hop hit and nice sweet malt taste.
"
1," Pours a cloudy, dark red with a small white head. Flavor is fruity and mildly sweet.
"
1," I think this is a classic.  Its not too complex, but when a beer is this balanced and tasty it doesnt have to be.  There isnt too much of an aroma, except for refreshing yeastiness.  Im not sure how to describe the flavors, but they are integrated perfectly.  This wont knock the socks off too many people, but its a beer Id gladly drink any time.
"
1," 330 mL bottle in a tulip. Copper colour with thin head. Balanced malt and hop.  A bit fizzt on the palate.  Overall a nice dubbel.
"
1," Tasted this at the Paisley Beer Festival in April 2005. Cask, gravity dispense. Clear copper red in colour with a thin white head. Strong malt in the sweetly intense fruit aroma. rich resiny mouthfeel and poor lacing. Strong pale malt component gives a robust maltloaf note with strong plum notes coming through, laced with sweet gycerine fruit. Robust hop resins give a pine note to the long aromatic aftertaste. Finish is powerful and malty with golden syrup notes really evident in warming alcoholic notes. This is an excellent old IPA style ale and highly recommended.
"
1," Brown with only a little head which only lasted for a short time. Probably the bottle was not chilled enough. intensive smell of banana, citrus and other fruits. tastes quite the same. some spicy flavours in there, too. full body and soft carbonization. long lasting taste of yeast and a little bitterness can be found at the end. very good!
"
1," Sweet Mary this is good.		Very  complex, but worth it.  Pours a red/brown with a floral, citrus, dark fruit, roasted malty hoppy aroma.  The flavor is much like the aroma and is accented by plenty of carbonation...high in ABV, but the alcohol taste isnt overly apparent.		Terrific.

1," Bottle. Pours golden, wiyh a white head. Aroma is malty, and just a hint of hops. Taste is sweet grainy/malty.

1," Pours pitch black with a thin light brown head.  Lots of dark roasted coffee on the nose.  A lot of coffee flavor upfront, with a twangy lactose quality, and a hit of cocoa in the finish. Slick mouthfeel.   Rich and full flavored, but not so overwhelming that I couldnt put down a few pints.  Wow, a sessionable coffee stout?  Nicely done!

1," Not in the same league as the Chimay Blue, but a decent trappist. Has a brownish-red colour with frothy white head. The taste has sweet caramel, fruits and spices. Not as much different tastes to enjoy as the blue.

1," [Bottle] Gusher! Pours a light golden color with a ton of head that lasts for a long time. Aroma is of grainy wheat, lemon and light yeast. Mild esters and light hops mix with cereal grains and grass in the taste. Light and fairly well balanced. OK overall. I thought this one may have been a bad bottle considering how it started, but the taste was fine.

1," Enjoyed on tap at the brewpub, this style is a staple of the Province.  Sourish-like yeast that grows on you.  The aroma is merely mly but it is complex.  Very thick white lacey on dark golden body.
"
1," (300ml bottle thanks to mar) milky white, huge chunks, leaves chunks on my glass. One of the nastiest looking beverages I have EVER seen. Nose of diapers, plastic, coconut and alcohol. Taste of alcohol, lactic milk, rice, spoiled peaches and cream if you could concoct something so nasty. This is gross.
"
1," Dark brown with a small layer of head.  No lacing while consuming this beverage.  The smell of alcohol tugged on the nose hairs followed by a hefty malt presence.  This is exactly what the beer tasted like also...  alcohol with lots of malt.
"
1," AUG 14, 2008 A really beautiful beer. This may be perceived as the lowly brother of the 3 in the Chimay family but I find it fabulous. I would describe this much like my Chimay Blue review but with a snappier, more aggressive spice. Like the eager businessman who doesnt realize he can still win the deal without being so in-your-face. Chimay Red has such a lightness in the drinkability yet so much flavor. Simply great.
"
1," pours a big foamy to rocky tan head with cloudy brown color.  Aroma is medium malt, dark fruit, sweet, bread.  Taste is upfront effervescence, then taste follows the aroma.  3.8

Double Cheers!

1," very rich and good, warm, dark fruit, dark candy sugar, rum and coke.		taste"
1," MAR 23, 2007 Absolutely amazing beer. If you are a fan of Abbey ales, this will blow you away. Do not be fooled by the 9% alcohol content. The beer goes down very smooth, and is not like the Rouge or Cinq Cints  when it comes to feeling heavy. The other two Chimay Trappist Ales leave me feeling full. However, Chimay Bleue has a more complex variety of aroma and taste that will not make you feel like you just ate a whole turkey. Although I love all beers  the Notre Dame Abbey at Scourmont has to offer, this is definitely my favorite! Enjoy with Roquefot Cheese. Or a mild to medium-bodied cigar with thick creamy smoke. Preferrably a Padron Anniversario, or Fuente Hemingway Series.
"
1," 750 mL Magnum poured into a snifter.  Pours a pretty chestnut-red with a nice head.  Its very clear and I didnt really expect it to be.  Aroma is yeasty, malty and sweet.  The taste starts out very sweet with a large dose of plum and raisin flavors.  Very sweet.  Nice, dry finish, though.  Well balanced.  Quite different from the other Chimay beers, but I like this quite much.

1," Clear reddish dark brown with some biege head. Slightly spicey aroma. Medium body with lots of light fluffy carbonation.Flavour is dark malt with some com[plex spicey tastes. A little thin on the mid-taste with some bitterness in the finish. Overall pleasant, but not subtle.

1," Bottle. A decent Belgian but not my favourite. A little underwhelming compared to the really really good ones. Dark brown colour. Dried fruit aroma. Faint fruity taste - not as flavourful as I was hoping.
"
1," Bottle. Aroma is really fruity with some spicy and fiery notes. Taste is full of raisans,caramel and other fruits. Aftertaste is a bit alcohol dominated and gives you a warm and nice finish.
"
1," On tap at GABF 2011. Pours a brown dark amber color, totally opaque. A huge funky fruity nose, lots of tart sawdust and cherries, some vinous notes. The flavor was a awesome and surprising burst of cherries, very tart, some sweetness comes through, wood, light lactic notes, very much a full flavored fruit sour (I realize it is also correctly viewed as a lambic). A low but lively body.
"
1," the nose is maltier than i expected, at least at first; and for an IPA, this is not what i want... but pine resin biscuits are apparently inviting - the flavor mimics, and leaves a dry hoppy taste, not to be without the typical floral and citrus notes. however, it seems too earthy (the maltiness that i seem to want to sense more than the hoppiness) and astringent (the citrus is taken more from rinds than the juicy fruits, if you know what i mean) for me, but i still like it.
"
1," 750 pours a cloudy brown with a slight white head, lots of lacing.  Aroma of caramel, sugar, yeast, spice.  Taste is similar with plenty of yeast, malt, and caramel.  Very enjoyable.  Mouth is smooth and nicely carbonated.  Great balance.  Overall, a very enjoyable trappist ale.  Lots of complexity.

1," Damn Good.  Third beer I tried at Beerfest in Orlando yesterday.  Chimay makes world class beers.  When I found the Chimay booth, I thought I was at the Unibroue booth and was asking for the Trois Pistoles, woops already crazy without any beer in me yet.
"
1," Dark brown with a moderate light tan head. Aromas of husky grain and dark chocolate. Not a real strong scent. Quite dry throughout. Not as smooth as many oatmeals. Some light oatmeal and mild dark malts in the middle. Some light lactic qualities seek in here and there. Dry cocoa finish and linger. Easy to drink, but nothing too exciting.
"
1," Cloudy brown.  Rich head.  Light caramel aroma with graham crackers.  Light palate, but the oak exerts a definite influence.  Nicely balanced - the oak livens up this normally staid brew, lends a hint of tartness in the finish and that cuts through the sweetness while leaving behind all the nutty brown ale character.  I really like what the oak does to this brew - this should be a permanent change.
"
1," 500 ml flip top bottle. Clear cloudy color with white head.  Smooth, nice and pleasant taste. Aroma is hoppy and palate is really nice. I really like this beer.

1," DEC 16, 2005 Fantastic brew... as most of the Monk beers are.  Pours with lots of carbonation, It This beer pours an active, murky brown color with red hues. The head is tan and bubbly. The aroma is yeast and raisins.  It hides the 9% alcohol very well.... It has a varity of fruit notes that pop up throughout the glass... and finishes a roasted malt

1," bubbly, away fast 	colour"
1," Bottle. Black with dark tan, wispy head, mostly diminishing. Aroma of dark chocolate, roasted malts, vanilla and a hint of bourbon and oak. The flavor is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic and lightly bitter. It finishes moderately bitter. Tastes of sweet chocolate with a nice touch of bourbon. Medium body with a creamy texture and moderate carbonation. Very slight metallic aftertaste with its dry, roasted malt finish. Good.
"
1," On tap at the Seven Bridges brewpub. Black with a thick, creamy tan head. Roasty nose, light coffee and chocolate. Burnt flavors, mildly roasted coffee and medium bitter chocolate flavors. Just a tad thin. Good.
"
1," Looks very similar to the Blue.  Smells slightly more malty with some fruit.  Head dissapeared and was smaller to begin with.  A little nutty, or hazel-nutty in the taste, some caramel, honey, sweet tastes.  Very good.  Silky is a good description of mouthfeel.  Chimays are good, but sometimes the taste becomes a little TOO familiar by the end of the glass.  Very good in smaller increments though.
"
1," there are beers as good as Chimay, and maybe even a few that are a tiny bit better.  But when you factor in availability (you can get it in almost any high-end liquor store, at least here in New England) and price (at 10 to 12 bucks, its about the same as a very mediocre bottle of wine), Chimay Bleue and its white-label cousin might be the best beers in the world right now.
"
1," WOW!  This is a great libation!  Kind of heavy but knocks you flat on your butt after a couple.  Went really well with a slice of gouda cheese and brown bread.  Good aroma and color.  Poured with a lot of head the first time, but less when poured into a wet glass.
"
1," Easily the most interesting beer on their menu.  Smoky rich porter with a faint sweet maple backbone.  Delicious, and different than what you usual find at a tiny local brewpub.  Well done.
"
1," Bottle @ Bamberg. Pours clear golden with a small off white head. Very malty and grainy nose and flavor. Bit of grassy hops. Smooth. Decent.
"
1," Tap at the brewpub in a taster glass. Pale, hazy, greenish yellow pour with a quickly fading white head. Aroma is quite citrusy with banana-wheat notes. Lots of spice as well, smells delightful. Taste is light and slightly tart - lemon flavors mainly with a bit of orangey sweetness. Palate is a bit flat but very refreshing. A nice wit .
"
1," Opaque amber color with a plentiful creamy head that maintains itself very well. It has a pleasant candy aroma with caramel and fruit notes.  The flavor has the same sweet and fruity complexity of the aroma with a bitter note. It has a full body but remains very smooth and drinkable.
"
1," Hazy, chestnut-amber coloured, smaller ""dirty"" head with a little lace; quite solid caramelly-nutty nose with a touch of alcohol and a certain sourish fruitiness underneath; moderate to solid sweet flavour with a light acidity, full bodied; warming,  sweet nutty-caramelly finish with a very faint tartness in the aftertaste. Nice winter-warmer....
"
1," Pours with a nice head that lasts.  Appearance is an opaque reddish brown.  Nose is fruity, and somewhat spicy.  Flavor is complex and full, with hints of darker fruits, maybe even cherry and fig?  A friend of mine remarked it was almost wine-like in flavor; not sure if I agree, but could see where he was coming from.  Pleasant aftertaste.  High ABV was barely noticeable.
"
1," Bottle. Pours a nice murky brown with a medium tan head. Subtle floral and yeasty aromas. Taste of brown sugar, figs, and raisins. Full body with a creamy texture.
"
1," POP! Cork almost slipped from my hand, could have almost hit the ceiling, and the bottle rocked.  (As in, it wobbled on the desk, but it rocked in that it's a cool bottle, too).  Sweet aroma, smooth and balanced smelling.  Banana and berries and spice and something lightly musty but nice.  Hazy orange-red color with a good head that stays a bit.  A bit of lacing.  Slightly sharp on the tongue, some alcohol taste, but not overpowering.  Light sweetness and a bit of maltiness and spice.  Good bitter finish.  Lots of sediment at the bottom of the bottle.  Fairly smooth in the mouth, a tiny sting going down, but no point loss for that! Good.
"
1," AUG 11, 2006 Had this one from the tap at the brewery. Poured dark with decent head. Has aroma of dark chocolate and coffee. Flavor is pretty smooth consisting of same dark chocolate/coffee taste. This was first porter so I dont have much to compare it to. 		Update- Second trial 07/01/06		For some reason the July batch seemed to have lost some of its flavor. Seemed to be watered down
"
1," This was a very tasty beer.  It complimented dinner (steamed Mussels) very well.
"
1," This one had carbonation issues like the oatmeal stout.  First pour was all foam.  Eventually it settled into a mostly opaque darkness with a frothy tan head.  Aroma is full of warming bourbon, sweet malts and a touch of dark chocolate.  Starts with a pleasant oaky sweetness with nice bourbon balance and robustness leading to a bready smooth bittersweet cookie dough finish with lingering bourbon oak flavor.  Incredibly complex for such a low alcohol beer, which makes it very drinkable.  Many thanks to atpayne for this fine brew!
"
1," On the pour, thick 3/4 inch head, hazy deep cloudy brown, some sediment mixed through out.  Smells very fruity and robust. Taste was ok, very sweet and almost a little rough. I prefer its younger cousin though(the white).  Alcohol very aparent, and leaves the palate slightly dry.  Over all, ok, but not my favorite Chimay.
"
1," Hazy gold pour.  Fluffy white head and drippy lace.  Aroma is grainy with some hints of citrus.  Flavor is corn, citrus,  and yeasty
"
1," Poured black with a huge tan head.  Aroma of roasted malt with the bourbon running underneath.  As opposed to the porter which had the bourbon on top.  Flavor of roasted malt with a touch of bourbon.  Smooth mouth feel but not as creamy as I thought it would be for an oatmeal stout.

"
0," SEP 15, 2007 Draft... Brewed to imitate Michelob Ultra and other low carb beers. They did a good job. Flavorless and aromaless with the exception of some very light honey notes. Perfectly balanced, but thats not saying much regarding a beer with so little malt to balance out. Tastes like an N/A. Much like having sex in a canoe, this beer is fucking way too close to water.
"
1," Pours a dark, cloudy brown with a huge tannish-white head. Yeast and malt dominate the nose. The body and mouthfeel are both excellent, with malt, yeast, caramel, and fruit following through on the pallate. Finishes crisply, with a hint of spice on the lips and palate. Very, very tasty.
"
1," This relatively dark pour has a thin head and a deep caramel-colored pour. The flavor is reminiscent of creme brulee, pineapple, and just a hint of leather, yet not overwhelming. Effervescent and cola-like, this ale would do well along side a hearty meal.

1," Very good belgian ale, exactly what youd expect from monks.

1," Grey wax-dipped bottle.  Brown sugar nose, a little nutty, heavy quad-like dark fruit with figgy/plummy tones, a little berry, and a little tobacco.  Some sweet phenols.  Ruby-caramel pour with a good tan head.  Tangy, sticky malt presence, lots of sludgy (vominty) caramel, earthy tobacco, and a little too much booze showing.  Sticky lips and full body, sweet and dry, touch of spice with candi sugar, and some cloves and figs and cherry.  Some nice flavors here but its rather rough around the edges.

Taste is medium bodied and smooth, with a gentle flavor of roasted malt giving way to a long, effervescent finish of dark fruit and a warm boozy bite.  A marvelous strong ale with a little more flavor complexity than most.
"
1," Quite possibly one of the finest ales ever produced. No aftertaste, very smooth with a hint of sweetness on the tongue.
"
1," Draft sampler at Barley Island. Light brown pour with a moderate frothy off-white head that diminished slowly with some lacing. Light caramel malt aroma. Medium body. Moderate roasted sweet malt flavor with an average small bitter finish.
"
1," I was suprised by this one. Something fruit, something sweet and bitter. Better than Chimay Triple i think.
"
1, A lame Abt-style attempt.	How

"
1," MAY 22, 2010 Bottle, 300ml. Sweet. Browinsh, copper, typical belgian head. Hints of raisin and other fruits, caramel and spices. Complex indeed.
"
1," would have to be the best beer that i have available to me, the subtle taste of nutmeg blended beautifuly to creat a smooth textured trappist style ale.
"
1," Starchy, as described by flemdawg. No balance, just a lot of yeast notes that lacked any hints of fruitiness. Watery body lacked any sign of malt flavor. Odd.
"
1," 12oz bottle from StFun, as part of the latest round of NP10. Thanks, Josh!!! Oh how I love coffee flavors in a stout. This one has a big roasty nose, rich toasted malts with a strong barrel presence to it as well. The pour is moderate, with a decent tan head and prickly carbonation. The bourbon tends to dominate a bit too much in the taste, overwhelming some of whats there in the solid base beer. Mouthfeel is slightly thin too. But its a decent brew that Im glad to have tried.
"
1," YUCK. this smelled bad, tasted funny, and was nowhere near as good as the other belgian style beers Ive had and this is acutaly belgian.  Im gunna wait for blue to come around
"
1," 330ml bottle into a Delirium tulip.		Pours a dark, ruby-rimmed brown. Insane head lasts for almost the whole glass, but leaves surprisingly little lacing. Beautiful nose on this thing. Plum, raisin, anise, coriander, and a hint of booze. The dark fruits and spice form a perfect balance on the palate. Wonderful. Medium mouthfeel. Crisp carbonation, but not too bubbly to prevent the flavor from lingering. Very drinkable.		theres a reason that Chimay is the first thing people think when they hear the word Trappist, and this is it. A must try for any beer lover.
"
1," A 2008. The big one for Christmas dinner. A perfect match to the turkey and veg, lovely. Also a perfect beer to share at the dinner table. Fruit, apples, spice, bread, loads going on, some tannic hop dryness. Open one of these for people who like wine but not beer. Change some minds.
"
1," The first time I had this it wasnt very smokey, but had some nice leafy hop flavours.  The second and all subsequent times those hop notes were gone, but we had a dry smokiness and burnt notes in their place.
"
1, Odeur de caramel avec une pointe dhoublons. Apparence
1," On tap at the brewpub. A maintay of their product line, a passable beer. A light fruity colour, a touch of head, very lacey. Malty sweet. Carbonation is above average. All of the beers here were fresh looking. with a white head and heavy lace.
"
1," Smells like those raisins you get in rum and raisin chocolate. Deep colour. Creamy head.		I love this beer. The only beers that I can think of that stand in its way for top rating is Tripel Karmeliet and Rocheforte, and this is quite a bit cheaper. (St Ives Vintage Cellars $6.5/330ml)		It's thick, rich and smooth, you can understand why monks may go without food for a while if this is the alternative.
"
1," Shared bottle at RBNAG-11. Pours clear golden with a big white head. Aroma is full of spicy malts. Taste is moderate sweet caramel, fizzy mouthfeel.
"
1," Smells of yeast and malt. Plum colour, creamy head. Cyclone of carbonation in center of glass. Tastes of plums, raisins and dough. Fabulous mouthfeel. Fantastic these corked ones.
"
1," Bottle, courtesy of fonefan. A clear, pale golden beer with a small, off-white head. A bit grainy on the nose, quite fruity too. The flavor has a little pleasant bitterness to support the pale malts. Some lemony notes, and luckily not as grainy as the aroma. Medium body, dry. Long, bitter and slightly grainy finish. A boring aroma leads to a nice flavor. Quenching and quite pleasant. 110129
"
1," Chimay Premiere - Beautiful Ruby body with appropriate head. The beer unleashes a perfect blend of spices with malt sweetness. There is definitely something bready in this and an almost warming finish. Good stuff.
"
1," MAY 2, 2003 This trappist ale pours a clear amber color with a big, off-white head. The head lingers and produces good lace. The aroma is fruity, spicy, and yeasty with hints of banana and malt. Medium body with full carbonation, the flavor is malty with some balance provided by the hops. The finish is sweet with a touch of malt and banana flavorings. Great ale.
"
1," Impenetrable black liquid. Large tan head of thick foam that lies dense across the top for good length. Big stretched out inky blobs of lace coat the glass.		Aroma is rounded and roasty with a firm sensation of oaty sweetness with a bit of cocoa and fresh frappachino froth.		Taste is firm and semi roasty with an overall smooth, creamy oatyness thats got a light sweet tang of oatmeal mixed with chocolate cake. The coffee is light throughout until the finish where it picks up a nudge of slight burntish bitterness. Stays pretty favorable in the creamyness of chocolate and oat malts for most of its taste profile. 		Nice smooth, creamy texture and body. Stays firm and medium with a nice silkyness and easy going roast and coffee bitterness thats favorably clean and kinda crisp.		This is a pretty nice Oaty stout with just a slight coffee kick that engages a solid drinkablility.
"
1," The aroma is light, but then again I on the third Chimay of the night.  the appearance is a cloudy copper with a cream head.  the taste is of sourdough bread with a somehow sweet aftertaste?  This beer goes down smooth and is easy to drink, overall a nice beer.
"
1," Strong aroma of yeast and apricot. Dark red-brown appearance. Very busy taste, its got apricot and cherry and raisin and unlike other reviewers have said, the alcohol can be tasted but this is not a bad thing as it just adds another layer to the flavor. The palate is a bit bubbly for my liking but otherwise a very enjoyable brew.
"
1," This is really a fantastic pils. A great dry slight hop flavor, not too heavy or strong and eminently drinkable. Tasty beer at the little festival in orbendorf.
"
1," Grainy and nutty malt character with hints of diacetyl in the nose and first sip.  Very smooth and oily. nearly tasteless at finish. (?)
"
1," Gravity at Birmingham Beer Fest. Definite artificial, plastic edge. Heathery hops maybe, with some blackcurrant. Smooth, with some metal. Spoiled slightly.
"
1," Dark born pour. Aroma of malts, coffee and bitter chocolate. Light-medium body with a slightly bitter and sour finish.
"
1,"   Bottle that Nick & Anna (next door neighbours) brought back for me from one of the regular excursions up to Harris, cheers Nick & Anna, consumed 30-12-09   Pours dark, dark brown with light beige medium head. Touch thin in the mouth some minerally characteristics, there is some light chocolate and caramel and a touch of roastiness with light tinge of sour fruit. Its fine enough.  A6 A4 F6 P3 Ov12  3.1 
"
1," Bottle, shared with my father in law. Light amber, ecru head, short lived. Spicy aroma, with nutmeg standing out. Heavy on the spice, which is fine by me, but light on the malt, which is NOT fine by me. Not offensive, just a little thin and one dimensional.
"
1," Pours an impenetrable black with hints of red (in the right light) with a beautiful off-white head which lasts for quite a while. Beautiful dark fruity aroma, detectable alcohol. At first, there is a roasted taste, followed by a malty, fruity taste, and then it resolves into a lingering hoppy aftertaste - metallic, grassy hops, perhaps a late addition? Not unpleasant. Slightly excessive carbonation, but sufficiently thick body. A really excellent beer - something for everyone. A truly balanced Belgian ale, and a delight to consume for my 100th review!
"
1," Ooooh mercy! This is one dark ale that needs to be on everyones taste list! This brew poured up a dark root-beer brown colored body sporting a huge frothy off-white colored head with good retention (slowly dissipating down to a thin sheen) and amazing lacing effects. Aromas of figs, dark cherries, sweet malts, pine nuts, cloves and spices (like nutmeg, cinnamon, etc.). The flavors are of the same but oh so complex  each sip has its own reward and it gets much better as the beer warms. Medium- to Full-bodied, ultra smooth, slow carbonation with a finish that is dry and you will definitely know that there is some alcohol in this one! Definitely a brew to pair with a slow-grilled juicy steak!
"
1," Bottled, dated end of March 2005. I must say I cant find much to say about this . Theres little aroma, malt, and only very slightly. Orange/brown in colour with a poor head, there is a pronounced haze, is this bottle-conditioned or is it a result of its age? Malt again on the palate, with citrus on the finish. Im not impressed...an unbalanced brew, perhaps I should try a fresher version.
"
1," Bire brune aux reflets rougetres. Des odeurs de cerises sucres, de levure, de caramel cossais et dalcool sen dgagent. Un got assez complexe, difficile  identifier, on y dtecte toutefois des parcelles de fruits schs; de dattes, de figues et qui nous titillent le palais avec son ct alcoolis, laissant en passant, une lgre amertume plus quagrable.
"
1," OK. Under tough circumstances this could be the best of whats available. But generally not a top choice for Belgians.
"
1," Not a huge fan of this trappist. Don't care for the long finish. Very good intial flavor full of fruit.
"
1," OCT 13, 2003 ReRate 10/14/03 Big bold flavor, spicy, peppery, yeasty, leathery aroma and flavor, more dark and fruity notes of plums, figs, raisins. 	What a fantastic creamy / oily smooth mouth feel, can you go wrong with this beer, No, I think Not!!   	I very much enjoyed drinking this Chimay Grand Reserve. It is a dark amber ale with a thick large head, complex flavor, and a High 9% ABV content. I am no true beer guru but I am definitely an enthusiast, This is a great Belgian ale.
"
1,//www.ratebeer.com/ViewUser.asp?UserID=3 and <a href=http
1," This is definitely my favorite of the Chimay ales that I have had.  It smells light and sweet, with a hoppy twinge.  Looks great--dark and cloudy with a caramel colored head.  The palate is so complex, with a sweet hoppiness that ive never really experienced before.  Dark malts also reside in this complex, lovely beer.  Great stuff.
"
1," Bottle (2006 BB 2011). Sweet malts and lots of alcohol. The slight spicy yeast and toastiness to nothing to relieve the cloying nature. Not so great for me.
"
1," NOV 15, 2009 750ml corked bottle. Dark murky amber with big foamy white head that thins to nothing quickly. Yeasty alcohol aroma. Bubbly, malty, dark fruit, mild taste. Surprisingly dry for a Belgian.
"
1," Distinct yeasty taste with floral palate. Ended up pouring it the wrong way the first time, second time way better. Great, but not the best Trappist Ive had (Rochefort 10), distinct taste. Nice off-white head. Hints of roasted malts. Very well rounded.
"
1," JAN 8, 2006 Great beer. Good aroma. Complex taste. A good beer for a special occasion. Must take the time to enjoy this one.
"
1," Mmmm this is a delicious beer. This beer gets its greatness from a very unique taste, not just throwing in tons of hops and getting a high rating just because of that.  If youre looking for a world class beer that anyone can enjoy this is it.
"
1," Aroma dolce e fruttato. Gusto morbido e ricco. Corpo non eccessivo. Ha dalla sua il costo abbordabilissimo e la facilit di reperimento.
"
1," [500ml bottle, Hebridean Brewery] Dull coppery colour with a thin white head. Earthy malt aroma with a touch of hop in there. Malty, fruity taste with the signature bitter astringent finish that you find in most Hebridean brewery beers. Warming though, theres a boozy punch in there [15042009]
"
1," A really deep and intense flavor. The alcohol content surprised me.
"
1," Really a terrific beer! very complex flavor with a sweetly high alcohol content that adds a very unique level of complexity.. smooth palate. great aroma. sweet but restrained to perfection. definitely recomended
"
1," Dark brown beer with fine beige mousse. Aroma is caramel, spices and coffee. taste is sweet, roasted and spicey, It ends with a good dosis of hops. Very mong taste.
"
1," Hazy medium gold with a bright white head. Sweet banana bread, with some almonds. This is a pleasant, sweet smelling brew. The taste is typical wit with some flat Sprite and corriander notes. There is a little bit of bread crust with some bananas in the finish. A decent wit, but pretty boring.
"
1," [Bottle 750ml, fresh, chilled, classic SAQ selection]	The last time I took notes on this beer was few weeks ago with Daniel Bilodeau but I just found my notes.		This is probably the best imported beer we find here, in Quebec, but unfortunately, its the most expensive too.. 8.50USD / 750ml ...it does worth every cent of its price.		Cloudy brown/yellowish color. Thick tan head that eventually diminish to a thin film. Ginger/brown sugar, roasted to the nose. Full bodied, complex. Medium to strong flavors. Round texture. Some bitterness from roasted malt as a finish.		Try this with a pepper steak or stroganoff beef. Get a rich flavored stout with a crme-brule for desert ...you will touch paradise.
"
1," A light hop aroma with decent lace. Solid hop aroma and flavor with touch of malt. Crisp finish. Again, not memorable but easy to drink.
"
1," Pours an amber color with  a white head.  Aroma is malty, caramel, roasted malts, and some spicy/peppery hops.  Flavor is malty, roasty, with a spicy/peppery hop finish.
"
1," Courtesy of CigarCityBrew. Pours deep darkness with nice looking mocha head. Handsome beer. The aroma has barrel wood notes, sweet bourbon and mild chocolate to go along with roasty notes and faint oxidation in the background. Delicious flavor with creamy mouthfeel ushering in sweet mildly roasted malts, rich chocolate and wood notes. I get a mildly building bourbon sensation and an oatmeal twang in the back. It seems to thin out just a bit into the finish. Tasty.
"
1," 12 oz bottle.  Dark purple brown with a thin ring.  Nose is raisin, orange and dough.  Smooth and chewy with buzzy carb.  Taste is plum, blackberry jam and banana.  Fades leaving peppery red wine.  At first i thought this was too sweet but the vinous finish balances things nicely.
"
1," Rich reddish brown in color with a frothy tan head.  Definitely can taste the wheatiness and the alcohol.  Sweet smell of flowers and wheat.  Slightly bitter aftertaste.  Overall, delicious.
"
1," bananas, spice, yeast, and a tang of citrus hops plus some brown sugar and alcohol notes. Long, neutral, bubbly finish that brings out some chocolate covered raisins. Excellent, but I remember it being so much more.
"
1," Bottle. Quite a light and still refreshing wheat. Slightly sour-ish malt, a little tart. Standard, banana and clove, but the flavour was rather short, not bad.
"
1," Not sure I can say much more than the others. A great dubbel that doesnt give of a lot of fusel alcohol aromas like many other beers in the same category.
"
1," Bottle at home. Pours a hazy ruby brown with a good head. Wonderful creamy flavour of dark fruits with a nice sting of alcohol. Sweet spicy finish.
"
1," Deliciously smooth. A very strong ale indeed. They hide the taste of high alcohol well but a warm bourbon feeling after sipping. Definitely an epic brew though.
"
1," One great beer. Aroma of malts,yeast,fruits. Taste is very nice and complicated with yeast,fruits,brown sugar and some chocolate(?). Long lasting finish. Nice body, strong in alcohol. Well balanced at all.
"
1," Pours well  with really smooth flavor. My favorite to date,but new to this area.
"
1," great full and crisp flavor, aroma is a little mild, but by far the best thing ive had so far
"
1," 11.2 oz bottle.  Garnet colored; small suspended particles make it somewhat cloudy.  White head settles to a flat sunny-side up.  Vinous nose; a bit of banana and prune.  Sweet toffee quickly fades to mild lemon and then carrot juice.  Soapy?  Medium body, medium carb.  Nicely even but not memorable.
"
1," Pours a dark brown with floating speckles and a small tan head.  Aroma of fruit, malt, and yeast.  Flavor of fruit and very smooth.  There is a slight warmth due to the alcohol, but you cant taste the alcohol at all.  This goes down very easy and leaves a wonderful taste in the mouth.  Strength of flavor was slightly disappointing, a little to mild for my liking.
"
1," Excellent aroma, head, appearance and taste. Quality all around. This is a good one that is easy to find.
"
1," Nice amber semi transperant color with a nice foaming head that lasts. Hints of fruits, balanced sweetness and a nice peppery and bitter finish. I prefer Blue but its still a damn good beer!
"
1," Pours a deep brown into a chimay glass.  Nice, steady 1/8 inch micro head.  Alcohol, date, fig and earth notes.  Creamy then full and fizzy.  Figs.
"
1," 330 mL bottle from LCBO gift pack.  Deep, dark brown.  Just really brown.  Beige sticky head, but not as much as I expected.  Lovely aroma of caramel, tart fruit, and, like the ad says, something floral.  Body is surprisingly light.  Alcohol is well hidden; this could be a standard 5% for all I can tell.  Sweet, but not overly so.  Bitterness in the finish, but not as much as their White.  As for specifics, theres definitely a raisin/plum thing going on, spices, nutty, mild caramel.  Mostly raisiny.  Good beer.  Funny to think it used to frighten me.
"
1," Pours a dark rusty brown with a voluptuous creamy head. Sweet caramel, bready, Belgian yeast aroma. Body has light carbonation, good malt balance, and a dry woody profile.
"
1," NOt bad, but a little flavorless, maybe I got the finish or the beggining of the can, but it was nice, fdark, but watery.
"
1," MAY 9, 2006 When fresh"
1," Pours a hazy darker brown with a large size bubbly head.  Aroma of dark fruits, belgian yeast, candy sugars.  Flavors of the same with some roasted malts and some light citrus that I didnt really pick up in the aroma. Lively on the tongue. A lot going on in the aroma and flavor.
"
1," I cant say that I was overly impressed by this one. The alcohol taste way overpowers its light body, and overall it does not come close to the Blue, or even to the Ommegang that I have been enjoying over the past few days.
"
1," Cork and cage bottle. Hazy brown pour with an off white foamy head and some nice large particles. Aroma is yeasty, bread, caramel, apples. Flavor is yeasty, tortilla, bread, and sweet.
"
1," 12oz. bottle.  Hazy orange color with a small film of white head.  Earthen and mild citric aromas.  Caramel and hard roll malt flavors with a vegetal and slightly spicy hop character.  Lemony hop flavors in the finish, with a residual woody astringency and ruddy maltiness.  Mouthfeel is medium, fairly dry.
"
1," The Dan Journal 246.  Tasted 10/31/08.  12oz bottle.  Smokey, malty and estery.  Mild yeast character.  Moderate burn.  Decent.
"
1," Metallic stale aroma and flavor that needs to be fairly cold to satisfy, light golden color with a minimal amount of wheat suspended, okay flavor that tastes a bit like cereal and stays on your tongue, overall its not bad on a summer day, but not really that good either
"
1," OCT 1, 2007 piacevolissima da bere senza troppo impegno,  sicuramente pi gustosa della Tripel e pi accessibile (e versatile) della Bleue. 	presa in un pub a Gavi, ne ho prese due perch (questa  la scusa ufficiale) la prima volta non mi avevano portato il tappo. Ribevuta oggi dopo un piatto di gramigna al rag fatta in casa.________________ENGLISH TEXT HERE__________________very pleasant to drink, its surely tastier than the tripel and more simple and soft than Blue. Two bottles at a bar in Gavi Ligure; again, at home, after homemade pasta.
"
1," Plums, currants, dried berries stand out in the aroma. Followed by a light spiciness,  cloves, very light black pepper. Not very yeasty for a big Belgian but just enough to add to the aroma. Medium to heavy sweet taste, much like the aroma"
1," APR 14, 2011 Vibrant copper, thick creamy head that fades to just a coating. Nose has stewed berries, earth, citrus, cloves, ginger. Taste is delicate and fruity. Carbonation is there but very restrained, interacts with subtle bitterness to produce a dry finish. [3.8]Big bottle, 11C. Copper with a beige head that fades to a good coat and sticks around. As above, mostly - fruit and spices, dark sugars. Carbonation and some spicy bitterness at the mildly astringent end. Lacks a little depth compared to the other Chimay brews Ive tried,  but its good.
"
1," Very good Trappist, I tried this in the Magnum size afetr have Westvleteren 12, and the Chimay is not quite as smooth and complex. But consedering it is  less than 1/2 the price it is a great buy.
"
1," Beautiful deep color, moderate head formation.  Wow, the nose is amazing.  Dark fruits, dried fruits, winter spices, very complex and varied.  Flavor is malty and spicy at once, alcohol never dominates.
"
1," Pours with a deep red-brown body topped by a thin to medium thick head with some lacing.  Its sweet and malty with a slight bready note and a touch of roastiness.  Medium bodied, smooth and dry.
"
1," bottle@home, pours clear yellow, light body little head not much to say just a good lager.
"
1," AUG 9, 2009 courtesy of Allen - translucid and bright amber colour, little persistent and creamy foam left; flowery and dusty aroma with notes of caramel; smooth and quite tasteless, thin to medium malt body, no bitterness and with a short aftertaste of caramel and flowers - gentle
"
1," Bottle at home. This is a strong (wonderful) beer with a big kick in it. My bottle had no head (but I always pour sideways.) Very dark, with coffee and chocolate ale flavours. A truly fine beer. A real pleasure to drink.
"
1," bottle. Clear, paerhapy very sligtly hazy deep orange-golden colour, small white head. Hoppy nose. Solid malty base with lots of resiny-herbal hops. Dry palate, like digging into a heap of dried hop flowers. Very nice hop character. In interesting interpretation of the style.
"
1," A- Pours a dark reddish brown with a massive doughy head.		S- Smell is sweet, of dark fruits and berries. Hints of raisin bread peek through.		T- Taste is sweet hints of apricots, assorted fruit and alcohol come to the forefront of the flavor. Starts off strong and backs away fairly quickly leaving a syrupy lining that tastes a little like robutussin in my mouth.		M- The mouthfeel is slightly thin, highly carbonated.		D- This beer seems to suffer a bit when it comes to drinkability. I just not digging the sickening sweet aftertaste that coats your mouth.
"
1," Great Belgian Ale.
"
1," Initial smell was apple, but easily could be apricot as advertised. Nice thick foamy head, but dissipates quickly. Dark brown color, I suppose reddish in direct sunlight. Thick, hazy in appearance. Flavor is sweet, lightly malted, with a dry bitter finish. Palate is strong and fizzy. I love dubbels but Im not a connoisseur so I think it is a great beer! Very different than the gold, still havent tried the blue.
"
1," 333 ml bottle. Poured a big frothy tan head that did not last till the end - high alcohols probably killed it. Beer was deep brown with just a hint of ruby highlights. Nose of rich sweet malts, sweet cloves combined with esters and alcohol - very low phenols. Very inviting and totally in style. Very sweet, rich malt, but not cloying due to high carbonation. Light chocolate notes, but mostly plumy dark fruit. Pleasant alcohol warmth in mid mouth that stays till the end. Hop bitterness is low, but light body more than compensates. Overall lighter than expected, but still pretty darn rich. Loaded with complexity but wonderfully balanced. A beautiful sipping beer to be enjoyed on a cold winters night.
"
1," 2007 bottle. Hazy dark brown, with cream coloured frothy head. Aroma has malt, fruits, metal, alcohol, yeast. Taste has red wine, red fruit/berries and some raisins. Alcohol breaks through some. Keeps taste through long aftertaste.	5-3-7-3-15=3.3		Re-rated blind at Dugges 080329. Hazy red/amber, low tan head. Aroma has fruits, berries, metal, alcohol. Sweet taste, berries, grapes.

"
1," Ive had so many of these over the years, I cant believe its taken me this long to review it! Anyway, here goes..	Bottle courtesy of Phil from Beermechants.com. Pours amber/brown with a good whitish head. Has aromas of raisins, chocolate, berrys, brown sugar. Flavours of chocolate, forest fruits, caramel, raisins, toffee. Finishes warming and sweet. A classic! God bless those monks!
"
1," Draft. Pours black with a tan head. Roasted malt aroma with coffee notes. Clean finish. What Guiness should have been.
"
1," Muddy deep amber colour with an off white head. Malty, wheaty sweet aroma with caramel and banana fruity notes. Malty, caramel sweet flavor with a vague yeasty note and a light acidic finish.
"
1," NOV 14, 2007 Lightly sweet, spicy, fruity aroma.  Deep brick-red color, very much opaque and unfiltered (bottle swirled).  Balance is amazing in this beer, the profile is overall, malty, but there is a very nice, spicy hop bitterness that follows right along.  Flavor progression is very meandering and almost artistic.  Finish goes on for a day and a half, and it has a very intriguing orange-spice aftertaste.  Carbonation, head, and lace are all there.  Body is medium-full.  Excellent!
"
1," Aromatic spicy nose  with a hint of plum, sugar and caramel.  In a glass the ale was  a rich ruby brown color. The head was thick and light beige and left lacing all down the side. The taste was richly malty and fruity with a touch of sweetness. The relatively high alcohol content ( 7%) was well hidden. Over all a delicious ale.
"
1," Bottle at Beer Mania, Bruxelles. Golden amber body with tall foamy head. Looks just lovely. Nose spicy and fruity. Taste of oranges, cookies, malts, some fruit. Very smooth taste and texture. Quite silky. With spicy finish. Pretty good. But also somewhat unbalanced.
"
1," On tap at Hamilton Place. The body was hazy dark gold with a white head. The aroma was light with the clove and bananas. There was also some bread crust. The taste was banana peels with some peach skins. Very little spice and a weird bologna finish.
"
1," Very dark brown - off-white head of fine bubbles.  Aroma is of bread and dark fruit.  Taste reminds me a bit of molasses - also some yeast flavor in there.  Somewhat earthy too.  Finish is light, but with a touch of hay.
"
1," cloudy brown, little white head. bready spicy aroma, alcohol, clovy-banana. Strong malty flavour, dates, bread. medium body and virtually no bitterness. pretty good.
"
1," Cloudy amber with an off-white head.  Belgian yeast, spices, and light fruits create a fairly complex taste. Sweet finish, medium body.  Solid and widely available.
"
1," This beer pours a VERY deep amber with a large tan head.  On the nose I smell plums raisins and possibly nuts.  The flavors emulate this too and I also get some good maltiness.  This is a semi sweet beer with some floralness to it.  Very well crafted beer from a great trappist monastary!  Cheers!
"
1," Bottle @ Paps. Pours a golden color with a small off-white head. Has a fruity grainy hoppy aroma. Fruity grainy hoppy bitter flavor. Has a fruity malty bitter hoppy finish.

1," Nice after taste.  The initial taste is alcohol which I dont care for too much in a beer.
"
1," Alc, yeast, dark fruit, caramel, chocolate. Taste"
1," not sure really.  big gusher, lost quite a bit before it calmed down enough to get in the glass! aroma of malt and deep red fruitiness,  some sweetness too.  big foamy head! tastes spicy and fruity.  	save the rest for a proper bottle
"
1," A standard light beer made for the BMC crowd going to Big River. Some malt in there and not too bad but its pretty light and watery. Pass on it
"
1," Draft-Big River-Chattanooga, TN. A smal sized tan head that was creamy and smooth and contained fine-small bubbles that mostly dissipated. This beerwas uncarbonated and it had an opaque body with a black hue. It had a malty and coffee nose and a sweet and mild coffee flavor. The mouthfeel was smooth, watery and thin and light bodied. This beer had a good lacing to it.
"
1," On tap.  A good Belgian, not too sweet.  Sour, fruity aroma and nutty flavor.
"
1," JAN 2, 2008 I have rated 3 version of this - the 2001, which was rated the highest is the one I have entered.		2007"
1," apricot candies, pears, then apples, slightly citrusy. Oily mouthfeel, almost syrupy; sweet and acidic apple juice, with notes of concentrated peach and pineapple. The balance of sweetness and acidity is perfect, it lacks a bit of complexity. Very good.
"
1," Draft poured at the Rock Bottom Brewery in Charlotte. A light beer in both flavor and alcohol content. Makes for a decent session beer.
"
1," I remember distinctly that I liked this beer but liked the tripel much better.  Aroma was of dark fruits and pretty heavy on the alky-hol.  Dry finish.  Will taste again.
"
1," Poured really black with quit a dark tan head. Its the aroma of smooth burnt toasted malt. Full bodied with almost chewy carbonation. Flavor is suggestive of those expensive Paradox barrel stouts. Notes of chocolate, wood, bourbon and vanilla. Whoops. I just figured out why barrel is in the name. Finishes smooth and somewhat astringent - or maybe thats my mouth trying to suck up the last flavor bits from my gums. Seriously, it is very good. Right in there with the Paradox and arguably much above Old Engine Oil Special Reserve. Hoosiers definitely rule.

1," 33cl bottle. In some respects, the description above is true. It does have a coppery colour and a creamy head. In other respects it is the most infuriating   thing, with packaging and back story so promising but the product itself so bland and watery. I wish all the flavours and nuances referred to were present. Enrageingly inoffensive.
"
1," Bottle. Solid, creamy, in-your-face coffee stout. Opaque black pour with rich, short tan head. The enticing aroma has plenty of roasted and burnt malts, coffee and dark chocolate. The flavor is moderately sweet and moderately acidic. Moderate to heavy espresso coffee bitterness in the finish. Very dry. Slight metallic aftertaste. Medium body and moderately creamy texture.
"
1," MAR 20, 2008 Dark brown red, murky. Very faint aroma of hops turns into a complex combination of malt and fruit. Malty, sweet touch in your mouth. Stingy finish that seems to linger forever. One of the very best. Now to age a few bottles for, say, five years and see how it develops...
"
1," FEB 21, 2008 330 ml. Beautiful, slightly cloudy chocolate brown with deep red tinges. Huge billowy head settles into a lasting, creamy brown sugar cap leaving nice crusty lacing. Aroma is raisin bread with subtle spice and yeast. Flavor is bread pudding with raisins, rum and not-so-sweet chocolate icing. Slight molasses finish with nice hop on the end. A lot of normally sweet flavors and aromas, but a nice dryness to the yeast balances the sweet notes in this beer. Not as good as the Rocheforts, but tops of the Chimays, and definitely world-class.
"
1," Enjoyed on tap at the brewpub. Sheets of lace, a white head on an orange tintedbody with lots of lace left. Hoppy aromas from Williametic. Carbonation right there. Decent IPA but would like a more agreeable mouthfeel. ome orange taste.
"
1," Belle comme une Guiness!  Odeur masqu par la mousse mais un peu de sucre pointe quand elle faiblit.  Un bon got de, caf et sucr, bien balanc.  Elle est soyeuse et onctueuse en bouche.  Jai beaucoup aim.
"
1," (Bottle 50 cl) Pours an unclean, muddy, greyish amber with a small, off-white head. Unusual somewhat vinous nose. Full-bodied, sweetish with both fruity and malty accents and an edge of overripe fruits. Lightly alcoholic finish without any real bitterness. 270706
"
1," NOV 3, 2008 750 ml. bottle. Pours an exhuberant, short lived head, with minimal lacing, over a reddish amber body....nose of sweet malts. some yeast with a bit of grapefruit....tastes of malts, over all rather dryer than expected, finish is of mild hops.....mouthfeel is very light. I know this is true to the style, and very well balanced, but I am afraid I am not that much of a fan of dubbels given my scoring. Such is the burden of the beerista.
"
1," This beer tastes very good and smells very sweet.  This beer gave me rediculous heart burn and caused me to get the alcohol overheated-feeling after just a few drinks.  I loved the taste, but this beer did not agree with me well.
"
1," Solid black body.  Nose is a slightly woody burbon.  Flavour is slightly burnt malts (black patent) with some chocolate flavours and a light burbon.
"
1," Black ales and black lagers are elusive specimens, so I am very pleased to partake of a Belgian inspired black ale. Into her dark depths do I prepare to surrender my soul.		her sinisterly seductive liquid fills my glass a dark brown with slight light glinting through along the sides of the glass; a faint amber hue. Not too much head, but an almost immediate brussels lace trail sticks to the sides of my glass. Her nose is lightly sweet with yeast and fresh fall apples. A touch of spice adds to the mix. My first quaff is full of bready chewiness and a smooth, slightly oily body. Faint effervescence prevents Sinister Minister from being too thick and overly cloying, though she definitely has a full body and mouthfeel. a bit more of a sweet and sour twang in the palate as opposed to the nose, leaving an almost lingering sour yeast pucker in the finish. A touch of banana notes alongside the crisp fall apples and spice.		Overall, an intriguing brew. The Belgian style element really changes this black ale from something ordinarily extraordinary into something unusually extraordinary. A bit confused I think as I was left not quite sure the overall impression the Barley Island Sinister Minister Belgian Black Ale was going for, but I do know I enjoyed it. Good; could maybe use a wee bit of fine-tuning, but not much. I would drink it again.
"
1," Very pretty Belgian brown.  Well structured trappist ale with quite a perfect head, reducing greacefully as you drink.  Aroma is less boozy and more complex than many Belgians.  The malt is framed so beautifully by effervescence, hops and alcohol, but I simply could not find much in the malt.  Lacking basic flavor.
"
1," 341 ml bottle from The Beer Store (part of Winter Mixer).  Pours a clear dark amber colour with small light tan head.  Aroma is nutty, with a hint of mild choclate. Flavour is similar though slightly sour.  A touch watery.  Ok.
"
1," great as all trappist ales are.  It is not quit as good as some others but it ranks up there.
"
1," Bottled. Golden colour, small white head. Aroma is fruits, some sugar, a bit arificial as well. Flavour is quite much artificial fruits, some grass and mild hay.
"
1, Fruity ; mostly cherry. Delicate bread malts. Sip 
1," Great beer overall. As it warms, it gives off an incredible array of aromas and tastes.
"
1," 33cl bottle. Murky orange brown with a small tan head.  Not much aroma, a little malt, a little hop, and little else.  There is no mistaking the alcohol in this one.  Quite yeasty, though there was almost no sediment, and very little suspended in the brew.  The alcohol and yeast overpowered the subtle flavors buried deep within.  Tastes a bit green, maybe a little age would develop this into a brew worthy of its high rating.  I am a fan of Belgian Strong Ales, but this one didnt do it for me.
"
1," Enjoyed this one in Brussels but available locally in US.  Reddish Brown in color, big head whic vanishes quickly.  Strong flavor and aroma.
"
1," A rich fruity malt base, with some grassy hops. Yeast also seems to be quite present. Sweet and a houch of alchol, maybe not the easiest thing to drink, but you only really need a half pint anyway.
"
1," (sampled at Clemati Medeltidskrog, Visby, Sweden) This batch was cloudy and brown with hints of ruby. Very smokey aroma with hints of honey and yeast. Taste is sweet and fruity with some sharp smokey notes. Long, long tasty and very warming finish.
"
1," Dark caramel with a light off white head.  Aroma is citrus, pine, caramel.  Taste is big citrus, grapefruit and caramel sweetness.
"
1," bread, toast, biscuits, toffee, more dark stone fruits, slight clove balanced by low earthy hops bitterness. Medium body with well-rounded mouthfeel, lasting sweetness and fruitiness in the finish. High carbonation, tiny bubbles from active bottle fermentation. Delicious in every way. An absolute masterpiece.
"
1," dark brown colour, with a fresh yeast and a fruity touch.. a classic for all beer lovers!
"
1," Sampled at ABR 07 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Pours an opaque dark brown brew with a thick tan head that has some good retention and lacing. Aroma of dark roasted oatmeal and black malt, a touch of coffee and some flowery hops. Taste is medium bodied, light carbonated with dark roasted malt and coffee flavors. Finish is semi-dry and bitter with a light coffee aftertaste. I prefer heavier textured stouts, this oatmeal stout is a little thin in flavor and thickness.
"
1," A dark brown beer with a good head. It has an aroma of fruit and yeast. The flavor is sweet and that of fruits. It tickles the tongue with the high alcohol content - but doesnt taste of alcohol. It has almost no bitterness. Definately one of the greatest beers in the world.
"
1," This is a great ale but not as good as the chimay blue or white. Nice balance of hops and malt.  Flavor is spicy, peppery and licorice.  Finish is clean crisp and lightly bittter.  Recommended
"
1," DEC 18, 2006 Thick off-white head on a dark reddish-brown body. Light spiced aroma with hints of flowers. Light malty flavor.		From a 2003 bottle"
1," The bourbon aromas were obvious and dynamic. Sweet chocolate and roastiness too - very nice aroma. Standard stout appearance leads to a slightly overpowering whisky flavoured beer. It finished fairly smoothly but I found it too thin and unbalanced to score high.
"
1," Dispensed from the tap a clear, light copper body with a modestly-sized, white head.		Smell"
1," Thick and heavy pour out of the bottle, dark brown, with a good lasting head of foam.  Complex taste from start to finish, fruity with alcohol presence and a little bitter at the end.  An inviting beer to be savored
"
1," At first I thought I must have bungled the pour, and after talking to other people, apparently its foamalicious. The taste is slightly rotten bananas.
"
1," 11.2 oz bottle at Bonaventure Lounge, LA.  Dark brown/amber cloudy body with a very nice inch+ white head.  Slightly sweet caramel aroma.  Flavors of yeast, caramel and a very nice spiciness.  Finish seemed a bit weak.  I know I missed something because it was served way too cold (typical) and I didnt have enough time to let it warm.  A very nice beer.
"
1," Very smooth taste, great taste overall. Head was about half finger high at pour, dissipated quickly. The color reminded me of a dark apple cider. I really enjoyed this beer
"
1," My favourite Chimay beer.  Nice copper pour with a creamy slighlty tan head.  A lot of fruit in the cent.  Fruit continues in the flavour, some caramel, some spice.  A slightly warming aftertaste.  I am a huge fan of this it just tastes great and goes down easy leaving a nice warm aftertaste.
"
1," Draught@brewpub (Portland, OR)	Dark copper color, small steady off-white head. Light caramelly aroma with some toasty notes. Light-bodied. Weak caramel, weak bread in the flavor. Not much going on there.
"
1," first impressions rather smokey aroma with smooth tannins  and slightly watery finish but with nutty after taste completmenting the product. Please import more to new zealand, love the stuff GREAT!!!!!
"
1," Swingtop bottle. High creamz and lasting off-white head. Clear dark brown bodz. Roasted barlez malt caramel fruitz aroma. Sweet caramel honey cream cocoa flavor. Mildly hopped. Low carbonation. Long sweet aftertaste.
"
1," this is a damn good beer. a friend of mine bought me like two of these and we were just drinking these like it was water. this is the best beer ive had in a while
"
1," 750 mL from the local Farm Fresh (bottled August 2008 according to the cork).  Reddish-brown pour with a fizzy off white head.  Aroma of Belgian candi sugar, alcohol, and perhaps a hint of cherry (or at least some other dark fruit).  Taste is lightly sweet with notes of raisin and prune.  Medium bodied.  A very good beer that typifies the style.
"
1," Swing-top bottle.  Slight sour hay malt aroma with slight hint of hops.  Hazy pale yellow color with small head.  Strong hay/barley malt flavor with a moderate hops finish.  Nice body.  A very nice beer.
"
1," A copper color beer with a small head that fades very quickly. The aroma is sweet, fruity, and yeast. The taste is fruity, bready, and is very well carbonated. The yeast or the carbonation fizzles on your tongue. An OK Dubbel.
"
1," I like a little less sourness in my browns, but this one was decent outside of that fact.
"
1," Pours a dark, cloudy amber with a thin foam head.  Pleasant but light floral hops aroma.  Strong floral hops flavor on a thick palate, over a bitter hops flavor.  Sticky mouthfeel with a caramel aftertaste.
"
1," (11.2oz bottle).  Pours a cloudy caramel color with red hues and khaki head.  Aroma of caramel, port wine, raisins, and candied sugar.  Taste is sweet but not cloying with a touch of bitterness.  Full bodied with a sticky texture. Finish is slightly bitter and smooth. This beer is, simply, world class.
"
1," Overwhelming experience tasting this for the first time--Sweet and strong, like a port, but not cloying. Surprising strength.
"
1," DEC 31, 2008 old rating"
1," Small bottle, trappist glass.  Aroma of malt, sugar/caramel and fruit.  Palate is slightly tongue coating but effervescent as well due to carbonation.  The malty/fruity/caramel flavors are harmonious and work in unison.  Then the alcohol makes its presence known.  Mellow with a little bite at the end.  Overall a really geat beer.
"
1," NOV 7, 2009 [rerate] Finally got around to drinking an entire bottle of this.  Much better flavor and palate than I remember from the sample at alefest.  Very nice dubbel!				Bottle sampled at Dayton Ale Fest.  Dark brown color with a fairly thick head.  Not much lacing.  Extremely drinkable Belgian brew but not the most complex.  Its pretty hard to compare this one to the Chimay Blue.  Still, has nice sweet flavors of raisins and other fruit with slight yeasty aromas and flavors as well.  Pretty dry finish.
"
1," very nice brew, copper colour, carbonation evident but not disruptive of flavour.  A lot of malty caramel notes with mild fruitiness  in the flavour.  Very nice easy drinking double.
"
1," Its hazy golden with a white, creamy head, and the aroma has notes of malt, slightly perfumed fruit, alcohol and hints of acetone. The flavour is sweet with notes of malt, fruit, alcohol, and luckily the flavour is a lot better than the aroma, and its a quite nice heller bock.
"
1," Nothing to write home about.  Too carbonated, mild flavor, nothing stood out about this beer to me.  It wasnt my first beer of the night, so maybe Ill try it out first next time.
"
1," DEC 29, 2011 Bottled 330cl.  Lovely aroma of fruit and alcohol.  Deep brown colour with long lasting thick gloopy off-white head.  The taste is typically Belgian - candy sugar, fruitiness vinuous, but there is a certain unbalancedness to it.  Not sure if this is a complexity thing or a fault in the beer.  I know people reckon this has changed dramatically over the years, and its perhaps not as good as my first impressions of 12 or so years ago but its still a fine beer.  Score 3.9Subsequent rating scored 3.7. Average becomes 3.8
"
1," Great beer with a smooth aroma.Nice taste.Also the first trapist beer i have ever tasted.Then i started to fall in love with Trapist beers.

1," BODY, BODY, BODY!  Good God, this is as thick as hell, and its absolutely fantastic!   Beautiful copper in appearance, with a head i could shave with.  Scent of dried apricots and other fruits, honey and sweet spices.  Very well balanced, quite delish. I could drink this all day.
"
1," Bottled (BB 07/2009)	Thanks Bjrn!	Golden color, small white head. Grassy, unbalanced sticky hoppy aroma. Sweetish toffeish flavor with grassy hoppyness. Quite sweet bock.
"
1," Courtesy of Fonefan. Its hazy leaning towards unclear and the head is huge, white and creamy. The aroma has initially notes of sewer, but after a while its more like yeast, light clove and wheat. The flavour has sweetness, notes of banana, clove and wheat. Its OK as such, but not one Id buy again.
"
1," Pours a beautiful opaque copper with a frothy off-white head. The aroma is light and fruity, apricot, banana and various spices are noticeable. The mouthfeel is smooth and soothing. It lightly tickles your tongue and the back of your throat as it goes down. The flavor is yeasty and bitter but well balanced. Not as complex as the Chimay Bleue but interesting nonetheless and easy to drink.
"
1," Dark amber with nearly no head.  tasts of light malt that fades to fruit.  Hops are very faint.
"
1," FEB 1, 2008 Pours reddish gold with a consistent thick head.  Aroma of banaas, apples, raisins, and aromatic hops.  Well balanced beer.  Can definitely tatse the hops.  Bitter finish with some spice.  Excellent beer.
"
1," Bottled at Monks Caf Wallingatan, Stockholm.  Clear reddish brown, small head. Roasty, dusty and nutty, Dry with slim, rounded body. Mild roasty maltiness. Pleasant but inexciting brown ales without any real discerning features.
"
1," JUN 7, 2007 This brew pours deep, burnt brown color w/ a full, semi cremy froth.  Posseses a rather impressive retention in the head compartment and recedes to reveal a thick, lasting lace. Aromas of a malted bamboo earthiness. Full nectar w/ ample residual effers to include a few Champagne streamers. Bold and very flavorful. Big and malty w/ only a mild sweetness. Strong flavors of  drunken brownies, dark fruits, a hint of mint, tobacco, and green dark wood.  Theres a persistant peachpit bittering that emerges early on. The finish is long and bittered well. Superb balance in such a strong and complex brew. Highly recommended.
"
1," Pours a reddish brown. Aromas include, prunes, caramel and (perhaps a little too much) alcohol. Tastes a bit sweet for the flavors involved, but is slightly roasty, caramel (for lack of a better descriptor) and fermenting prunes/beets. Aftertaste is vaguely sweet, but primarily bitter with a hint of hops. I think its the overbearing alcohol and lack of Belgian yeast flavors, but I didnt like it as much as I thought I would, still a decentish strong Belgian.
"
1," bottle, dark brown, with medium brownish head. very full thick almost sticky flavor and long finish. a bit too sweet for my taste, and not something oned drink more than one of.
"
1," Bottle from Beer planet web shop. Hazy brown color with huge white head. Light aroma of dark fruits, caramel, yeast, banana, cloves, toffee. Taste, banana, caramel, biscuits, earthy notes. Surprisingly bitter finish. Good.
"
1," 33cl bottle served in a Chimay Trappist glass. Pours a ruby/amber color with a thick off white head, which dissipates quickly, leaving a white foamy ring. Aroma of yeast, bread, sweet fruits, malt, High carbonation. Coating mouthfeel, really sticks and stays with you. Fruit notes on the tongue. Dry aftertaste, with the malt coming through nicely. Didnt really get a bitter feeling with this ale. Fantastic sipping beer, very warming and no sense of the ABV.
"
1," gold medal winner and I can see why. aroma and flavor are toasted caramel malt, toffe, and a bit of grassy hops. mouthfeel is a little light and the color is almost dead on. not the best brown I have had but almost.
"
1," Bright red amber with a big creamy long-lasting head. Fruity, floral hop aromas. Sweetish dark caramel malt flavors with accents of cinnamon, chocolate and fruit. Sweet with a hint of hops on the finish. Clean, smooth, tasty-what else can you ask for from a beer?

1," (Bottle 25/10-2011) [2011] Low beige head, dark amber color, medium co2, yeast aroma, smooth taste. [2005] Taste seems more intense but still smooth.

1," Deep, deep, deep red with creamy low head that is a touch brownish and grey. Nose"
1," Bottle from Greenlife in Chattanooga. Clear brown, huge white head. Malty, toasty and fresh bread aroma. Flavor is lightly toasty, some spicy notes. A little nutty, as well. Maybe it benefited from lowered expectations, but I enjoyed this more than I expected.
"
1," (Bottle 50 cl) Slightly hazy, nutty brown with a dense, white head leaving laces. Aroma of roasted malt, banana and yeast. Medium body with roasted malt and tobacco - and some diacetyl. The finish is dry with an underlying acidity. 230407
"
1," You cannot go wrong here. Truly the king of beers. From the fruity aroma and taste to the  remarkable colour, this is always a pleasure. No matter if it is draught or bottle,  I always enjoy this one. The only drawback is that it leaves you wanting more, but seeing that it is rather strong it is not always possible to consume more.
"
1," Its just so smooth. That is what I feel stands out about this beer. If flows over the tongue like cream. I could detect no alcohol which suprised me considering the ABV. Flavors blend so well that it is hard to break apart. I would have to say slight musty leather with fruit. Nothing about the flavor jumped out at me. It was just a pleasant example of the core taste from most belgians I have had.
"
1," Cask conditioned at Coventry Beer Festival. Pale gold, no head. One of the most perfumed beers I have tasted, like drinking Eau de Cologne, and I not talking Kolsch. Some beer character gets through in a malty sort of way, but this is better suited as a gift for Mothers Day. I think Il dab some behind my ears.
"
1," My least favorite of the three, and still it is great beer.  Bottle to Trappist glass.  Pours dark amber with white head that does not last as long as its cousins.  I get caramel, coffee and chocolate malt.  Not as sweet as the cousins either, and has an earthy quality that is like a truffle.  Creamy in the mouth.  How can anyone complain about a beer like this?
"
1," Nice deep brown color.  No real scent at all on this one.  Flavor is roasty and a bit sweet.
"
1," A straightforward ale.  Very malty, slightly sweet start, smooth mouthfeel, pleasant finish.		This beer tasted much more ""commercial"" than I was expecting.  I guess I expected a more robust, raw ale from monks.
"
0," Cloudy amber with little head and no lacing. Funky soapy and earthy aroma, not very nice. Sour tasting, this sucks, it's that simple. Bad aftertaste too. The worst beer of the day.
"
1," The most well-known Trappist ale. It is a decent Belgian Strong ark ale, but not near the pinnacle.
"
1," Bottled 50cl. Ordered from www.bierzwerg.de. A solid example of the style. Not too much character though. Faint reminiscence of paprika throughout. Strong carbonation. Its just a flawless pleasant Weizen Bock.
"
1," very dark beer, remarkable and strong palate, but no particular taste.
"
1," Wrzig slicher Antrunk mit starken Malzengagement. Die Intensitt wird gehalten, die Wrzigkeit sticht positiv hervor. Ausgeglichen, weich, relativ hohe Karbonisierung. Eine lngere Lagerung knnte das Malz noch deutlicher hervorbringen, so ist das Bier noch eher hell, die vorhandenen Kruternoten verhalten. Zum Ende trocken, das Malz schwindet recht schnell. Herrlich wrzig wird es dann im Nachgeschmack, nach Spekulatius, tiefer malzig, frische Kruternoten spielen hier eine Rolle. Angenehmes und rundes Bier, bei dem ich auf gelagerte Versionen gespannt bin! 11/12/11/12/13/12
"
1," Bottle pours black as night, large frothy light brown head, with attractive lacing.  Burnt malts, espresso, and cocoa on the nose.  Slight burnt malt, roastiness up front, but surprisingly this one has very little bite.  Fairly smooth mouthfeel, decent body, but the overall flavor is quite light.  Finishes very quick, and with only a sublte hint of roasted malts and hops.  Looks great, tastes good, but lacks any real umph.  Lingering hop bitterness.  Thanks goes out to atpayne for the trade! 
"
1," Dark red garnet. Wet bark, yeasty nose. Thickish mouthfeel, with a substantial amount of carbonation. Sweetish, apple-noted malts hide the alcohol well. While not the greatest on my list, it has a comfort food quality that I love. A predictable goodness that I can reside in.
"
1," NOV 21, 2010 Bottle from the Bottleshop, Idar Oberstein.Orange-gold, head that fades fast. Fruity aroma, apricots. Taste is sweet - fruit, orange, apricot, syrup in the aftertaste. Very, very nice beer. Update"

1," Bottle  Pours a hazy reddish brown with a good off white head.  Nice stuff floating around.  Has a good aroma of floral, bread, and sweet malts.  Has a good carbonation.  The flavor is well blended.  Not real deep but very refreshing.  Has a medium body.  Good finish and a nice aftertaste.  Not as dry a texture as some of their beers but still a touch dry.  Very drinkable but not my first choice from Chimay.

1," Poured an amber color with a frothy small head.  Aroma is strong yeast with a little hops.  this one is a smooth drink!! has the yeast flavor with a malty taste to begin with but has a nice bitter hops and alcohol finish.  I would have to say this is my favorite of the chimay drinks. Thick creamy mouthfeel with a great taste.  Once again.. Those monks know how to make a great brew.
"
1," MAY 17, 2004 Re-rate. Vintage 1999. Bottle at Plan B, Copenhagen. I picked this bottle out myself, in Plan B's astonishing beer cellar. This dusty bottle screamed at me, Pour me! Drink me! Enjoy me! Feel me! And then i bought it. The beer was so happy to be let out, that it gushed out in the goblet. This hazy dark brown fluid is so beautiful with its creamy beige head. The aroma hit my nose as i poured it, lots of unmalted barley, malt, some sourness and a quite phenomenal touch of hops. The flavor is just as good, tastes like a old port, dry, alcoholic, dark fruits, raisins plums. Very good. Only complaint is that i found it a bit watery, but it ok i think. Very nice and very expensive beer, 16$ for 33cl!!!!	But it was worth it!
"
1," Poured a nice warm toned brown, with a fluffy head.  Aroma was mellow, but significantly yeasty, with some nut, caramel, and fruit qualities.  Taste matched the aroma pretty much perfectly, but since the aroma was low-key, the taste is more intense.  The body of beer was medium but the carbonation made it feel incredibly fluffy.  Finished slightly dry, but not as much as expected.  Low hop bitterness.  A very smooth and well balanced abbey ale.  All others will be compared to this.
"
1," Bottle 50 cl. Courtesy of MoritzF. Slightly hazy golden with tiny floating impurities and a white head. Spicy, almost perfumy nose with a floral hoppiness. Medium body with a good malt base and a somewhat raw bitterness. 291108
"
1," MAY 7, 2006 22 oz bottle - Pours very dark brown with a big, enduring head.  It has a heavy bourbon aroma.  The flavor is dry roasted malts and quite a bit of bourbon.  Theres a moderate body with okay carbonation.  The finish is unremarkable.  It loses something overall.  I thought the bourbon dominated too much, not because there was too much bourbon necessarily, but rather because there wasnt enough else going on.  Its alright, but drinking my way through the whole bomber I got tired of it.
"
1," Deep clouded reddish brown body. Medium foamy tan head. Aroma is malty and sweet with some caramel notes and some moderate spice. Some scents of yeast as well. Taste is nice! Malty and rich with more spice, yeast and some lighter caramel notes. Some dark fruit tastes in there as well, maybe plum or raisins. Everything is blended together well. Nicely balanced and filling. Mouthfeel has a fair amount of carbonation mixed with some spice. Finish is rather fruity and spicy. Another beer I cant believe I hadnt rated yet. Nice to revisit this one!
"
1," [Bottle, thanks Guerde] Pours black with a small, dark tan head.  Aroma is roasted malt, coffee, brown sugar and oats.  Some malt and then quite a bit of coffee and some chocolate in the finish.  Far too thin.  Decent finish.  The mouthfeel killed this beer for me.
"
1," Pours a copper color with a soapy tan head.  Aroma of fruit, yeast, and malts.  Taste malts, mild yeast, and apricot.  Nice beer.  Not quite a blue.
"
1," Huge frickin' head on this.  Light yeasty and flowery aroma.  Very complex somewhat malty/fuity flavor.  good stuff!
"
1," Nice carb structure in this one with great lacing. Spicy, floral notes on the nose. Tasty and goes down really well. This is a port-like beer to savor slowly. When served in the official Chimay glass, I get a metallic taste that is spoiling it for me. From now on, I decide the official ""proper"" glass!
"
1," This is the best Chimay Ale.  Its a darker brown color than both Rouge and Blanche.   Excellent spice aroma.  And perhaps the nicest alcohol finish Ive had in a beer.

1," Bottle at Cruzat, BsAs.  In my opinion - owing to the roastiness - its a stout, but there you go.  A good fruity, roasty beer with lots of toasty grain and coffee tastes, very dark in colour, with a pronounced burnt grain charcater to the malty, complex finish.  Impressive.
"
1," Pours a dark mahogany brown that shows slightly translucent on the edges.  A small, foamy, khaki colored head dissipates quickly, leaving a minimal ring around the edge.  Virtually no lacing noted.  The nose is strongly roasted, comprised primarily of bitter, dark bakers chocolate and intense coffee notes.  Likewise, the flavor is very straightforward.  Bitter chocolate and coffee are all the really come through.  Medium bodied and smooth, this one makes for easy drinking, but lacks fullness.  Finishes with a lingering, intense roastiness coating the tongue.  Overall, a pretty nice, sessionable coffee stout.
"
1," APR 29, 2005 Nice abbey ale, but nothing compared to westvleteren8 (ive had that one in a place  in my hometown). nice hopbitter and alcohol taste. good balance.
"
1," Orange with a fine head. The aroma is fruity with notes of apricot and peach. Im impressed by the flavour thats  different from the average triple, being far more bitter and herbal-like.
"
1," Opaque muddy copper pour with a quick dying head that wasnt too creamy. Sweet malt aroma with some fruit and spice too. Kinda weird palate, but still goes down well. I think I like it more than the blue.
"
1," A nice pour.  Not too much aroma, but a nice low foam head.  A nice balanced attack, which finishes to a pleasant flowery finish.
"
1," This most famous of the Trappist brews doesnt disappoint with its white - it is beautiful on the palate. A rich, spicy and sweet flavor that delights your tongue with taste.
"
1," 750 mL bottle from Trader Joes ($9.99).  Pours a murky dark chestnut brown.  The carbonation seems to give this a very cola-like head which was composed of large tan bubbles which disappeared very quickly.  Light and sweet aroma of yeast and bready malts.  Tastes stronger and better than it smells with sweet dark bready malts, caramel, musty yeast, brown sugar, cherry and possibly some other stone fruits.  All that carbonation moves playfully over the tongue.  Alcohol is quite well hidden.  Certainly my favorite of the Chimay line.
"
1," The aroma contained a citrusy note with a light banana ester and a nice wheat presence with just a hint of clove. The beer arrived crystal clear golden amber with a low lasting white head which laced the glass. The flavor was nice with wheat leading the charge. That was followed by a estery banana flavor and a nice clove phenolic. The finish went dry with lasting clove into the aftertaste. The body was medium with a moderate carbonation and the beer was crisp on the palate. Not a bad hefe, just a bit subdued. Nip glass (8 oz) served with a lemon on the lip of the glass.
"
1," I had this at a beer and food night and this one was the 'light' beer. It is lightly hopped with a hint of banana. The head in my glass was small with fair lacing. I thought the body could have been more robust and found the palate a bit too lively.
"
1," Not a huge fan of this beer. Trappists to me, almost always seem to have the nose and finish which suggests cloves to me, which is a good way to turn me off to a beer.
"
1," Pours a cloudy, brown-orange color with a small white head.  Very sweet, bready aroma with dark fruits.  Quite malty, almost cola-like; biting carbonation, great, sweet mouthfeel.  Refreshing, caramel finish.
"
1," Another excellent offering from Chimay, but not as good as the blue version this beer has a very smooth aftertaste with hints of apricot and other fruits on the palette again a great choice
"
1," DEC 18, 2004 1987 Vintage, 33cl bottle"
1," Draught @ IBF - Italia Beer Festival Milano 2009, Palalido, Piazza Carlo Stuparich, Milano, Italy.Clear medium yellow orange color with a average, frothy, good lacing, mostly lasting, off-white to white head. Aroma is moderate malty, toasted, molasses, sweet malt. Flavor is moderate sweet and bitter with a average duration. Body is medium, texture is oily, carbonation is soft. [20100307]
"
1," Bottle - nice yeasty, fruity aroma.  Dark gold to light brown in color with a finely bubbled white head.  Tons of floaties!  Amazingly creamy mouthfeel.  Malt and yeast fade into a hint of mild bitterness.  A beautiful beer.
"
1, Odeur dagrumes avec une pointe dalcool. Apparence
1," JAN 19, 2008 (Prev. 5/04, 6-4-6-3-14) Dark red-brown colored, little light brown head. Rich sweet and spiced aroma with caramel, hops and yeast, some vinous note and toffee also here in complex aroma. Medium to full bodied. Flavor is surprisingly sweet with this added sugar note, still vinous tone dominates here with mild chocolate and caramel. Aftertaste has rather obvious alcohol with still vinous touch.
"
1," Pours cloudy dark brown with light tan head that lasts.  Aroma of brown sugar, dark fruits, yeast and malt.  Flavor is bold with strong yeast and sugar tones.  Slightly bitter alcohol finish.
"
1," Draft. Pours light gold with a white head. Hop and malt aroma and flavor. Light bodied with a clean finish. I would drink this over a macro anytime.
"
1," The first time I had thi, I thought I was drinking Champagne.  the second time I had this beer, I knew I was drinking the best beer ever made.  Chimay is by far the CHAMPAGNE of beers.  There will never be any better.
"
1," This bottled brew poured a small sized head of fine to medium sized white colored bubbles that left behind an unnoted lacing.  The body contained soft carbonation, was transparent and yellow orange in color.  Its aroma contained notes of wheat.  Its mouth feel is initially tingly soft and dry.  Its flavor contained wheat  notes.
"
1," Had a couple sample pours at a beer tasting event in a local grocery store. Served in a champagne flute side by side with Chimay Red and Chimay cheese. Mahogany and amber brown in color, nice head that quickly recedes. Fruity and floral aroma, although not as big in the nose as I would have guessed. Bready, biscuity with some dark fruits like plums, raisins and licorice in the taste. I thought this had very similar flavors than the Chimay Red, but they are exaggerated and very bold in the Blue.  Well carbonated with that Belgian yeast characteristics in the finish. Alcohol presence is a little more detectable here than in the Red. This is a great sipping beer to have buy a fire, although the big alcohol presence might want me to limit to one glass. Really intense flavors make this beer stand out on it own, nicely complemented by the buttery Chimay cheeses.
"
1," From the wire-corked 25 ouncer marked L10-611.  Explosive popped cork leads to a pour that is dark, cloudy brown color with a fizzy, short lasting tan head. The aroma is full of dark fruit like black grapes, cherries, and fig along with yeast, and a faint alcohol note. Excellent full body.  The taste has a sharp floral bite along with a sweet Belgian candy sugar element. Almost 3,000 ratings prior to mine so there is little else I can add other than I think this is one of the best in its style.
"
1," Cloudy brown earth with big head. Lively. Aroma of plum, raisin, sugars, alcohol. Rich, strong taste, maybe a little too much alcohol but otherwise very good. Better than the Rouge.
"
1," Noire dencre.  Odeur de fleur de houblon et de pin.  Tr;es Amer, probablement 100+ IBU mais cest plaisant.  Un peu dagriume?  Plus prs de la double IPA que de la stout selon moi, jaimerais un peu plus de caf.  Un peu mince en bouche mais au final une bire que jai aim.
"
1," FEB 19, 2004  On draught at Belgian Beer Caf ""Belle Vue"", Kiev, Ukraine.  Hazy mahogany color. Unbelieavably ozon-like nostrils-filling aroma. Malty toffeish flavor. Fizzy, bubbly palate. Medium bitterness.
"
1," Bottle 0.33L.	Brown-to-dark red hazy body with a huge, rocky, light brown head, mostly lacing with an excellent lacing; medium-to-large bubbles of thin density.	Aroma is moderate-to-heavy malty (caramel) and lightly hoppy (citrus); notes of yellow fruits, red wine and light alcohol.	Moderate sweet and light acidic flavour; in the finish a light-to-moderate bitter note also appears.	Medium body with a creamy texture; soft carbonation; light astringent feeling in the finish.	Very good beer.
"
1," 330mL bottle, pours a cloudy dark reddish brown with a huge beige head into a tulip. Light aroma of apricot, yeast and caramel. Flavour is dominantly malt and yeast, with a dry mouthful and high carbonation. Like the Bleue, this is overrated.
"
1," Deep very dark burgandy nutty brown color. Normal crazy belgian head, white in color. Fruity, yeast, almost red wine taste. Alc is barely noticeable, but noticeable, and malty. Like other Trappiste not so much hoppy. Has a slight spice not sure what. Dry after taste. Strong, but easy to drink, especially because this is my 3rd beer of the night. I must add, almost no bitterness which i enjoy very much. Feels very much like a wine, keep in mind its over 9% alc.
"
1," Bottle.		Pours a good looking slighty hazy copper color. Spices, raisins, dried fruit, alcohol, yeast, sweet. Not bad at all, easy to drink.
"
1," AUG 23, 2009 My Bottom Line"
1," Light opaque copper, disappearing head. Quite tangy lemon and grapefruit taste. Well timed orange peel finish. Very slight hop aroma. Judged solely on taste it is fantastic.By now, my opinion of the brewer is hit or miss, but mainly hit, and this is one of the good ones.
"
1," Although, not my favorite, still enjoyable.  Fruity nose, with a spicy licorice, and fruity flavor. Not sure if it's worth the 4.99 I paid for the bottle.
"
1," Light hop aroma present, malty, fruits like grapes, dark fruits, plums. Candy and sugar notes. Appearance"
1," Aroma after much searching I got some apricot and cloves but no banana. Murky browny red suprised it's commercial description is ""particularly attractive"". Rich sweet smooth malty flavours with the tiniest amount of alcohol afterburn. At a decent temperature it almost has a fruity/apricot sweet aftertaste with a trace of bitterness.
"
1," bottled, thick fully carbonated medium brown pour, aroma of yeast/bread with fruits, heavy fruits noted on palate with balanced yeast biite and no obvious roasted/hop bitters, very light residual flavor on palate
"
1," A fairly mild IPA.  Average floral hop aroma.  Unfiltered honey color with a medium uneven head.  Mild bitterness with a dry finish.  Not very memorable.
"
1," Pours a deep golden cloudy color.  Aroma is pretty much of spices and yeast.  Flavor is the same but much more smoother than most Trappist ales.  Theres a reason why this one is known worldwide and highly acclaimed.  Probably the smoothest Trappist out there.
"
1," Initial aroma was Heineken skunk but mellowed to a wort-like malty concoction. Thin, soap sud-like head. Cloudy, light orange appearance. Odd, tart flavor - hard to put my finger on it - similar to many Russian lagers I have had. Slightly fruity, slightly malty. Surprised to see this categorized as a Pilsener - too rough around the edges in my opinion with a bit of bitterness. Mouthfeel is good - goes down smooth with no aftertaste - surprising considering the bitterness.
"
1," 750ml Corked bottle with 01/03 on cork Poured a reddish brown with a creamy tan head that settled down to a thin film. Aroma is spicy and with lots of yeast present. Peppery and slightly floral. Body is smooth and creamy and with an even carbonation. The flavor is a fruity malty one with yeast and sugar notes. Overall a fine Belgian that is the most available one I can think of.
"
1," Bottle from LCBO. Poured a dark liquid with the largest head I have seen in any beer. Served at a slight chill above room temperature. The smell was immediately rosy and very pleasant. The flavour was incredible. I am amazed by how great this beer is! Palate was very defined with a very refined sweetness. I was hit by flavours of what seemed like really amazing grapes, plums and prunes. Without a single ounce of hesitation, definitely on my top beer list.
"
1," NOV 15, 2009 La mia prima birra trappista..	Unesprienza senzaltro piacevole.	E un mix di aromi e sapori che si mescolano insieme trovando un ottimo equilibrio che non ha intenzione di strafare.	Non lho trovata neanche troppo costosa, 10 per la 75cl, un prezzo ragionevole per una birra di questa qualit.
"
1," A somewhat bitter trappist with flavour of herbs. Quite OK, but there are better trappists.
"
1," APR 1, 2009 coppery colour with nice head.aroma of fryuit,especially apricot.spicy flavour with a touch of alcohol.medium body and a bit of bubbles.leaves bitterness in your mouth.definitely a really good beer
"
1," From the Jug at the GABF Colorado Convention Center, Denver 11/10/2008	Fruity aroma. Golden coloured with a passion fruit flavour. A little dryness in a crisp and lasting bitter malt finish.
"
1," Dark brown with a big beige head. Fruity aroma , dark flavor. Goes down so smoothly with a warming finish. Someone told me that this was originally a seasonal winter brew and it sure fits the profile - I find myself much more in the mood for it on a cool winter night.
"
1," Bottle 500ml.Hazy medium grey orange color with a large, frothy to creamy, good lacing, fully lasting, off-white to white head. Aroma is light malty, moderate yeasty, banana, yeast, rubber. Flavor is moderate sweet with a average to long duration. Body is medium, texture is watery - creamy, carbonation is soft. [20101015]
"
1," APR 6, 2005 Simply unbelievable.  Never had any beer this good, and doubt I ever will.  It is definately worth $10 a bottle.  Just wish I had enough money to drink it every day.  Hell, maybe Il move to Belgium.
"
1," Brown reddich color middle creamy head. Strong alcohol and malt smel. Taste is malthy smokey with a nut finish. A very strong but gentle beer. Very good!
"
1," Large bottle.  Dark reddish-brown.  No shortage of yeast, but it is not offensive.  Fruity aroma and taste that somewhat belies the alcohol content.  My favorite of the Chimays.  This is the one that showed me many years ago that the U.S. really didnt know how (at that time) to brew a great beer.
"
1," The commercial description of this is pretty right on. Popped the cork on the bomber bottle as part of New Years Eve celebration. Poured a cloudy light brown with an orangish tint. Had a tall thick foamy head that settled slowly. Nice malty aroma and a creamy carbonated feel. A crisp initial mild bite, but also slighly sweet and hoppy a nice mix of flavors. Mild alcohol taste with a nice complex finish.
"
1," DEC 10, 2004 This is my original rating corresponding to a 4.8 score and a somewhat naive palate"
1," Bottle 33cl from an armenian shop, a golden amber beer with good head and lacing. Nose is malty and on caramel malt. Aroma is a bit disappointing, medium sweet with a watery finish, malt notes are medium to low with a wet paper like finish. Hops flavor are low, just latent bitterness, poor body for a strong lager.
"
1," Bottled. A hazy golden beer with no head. The aroma has notes of phenols and chemicals. The flavor is sweet with notes of matl, fruits, and phenols, leading to a dry alcoholic finish.
"
1," Pours a transparent bright copper orange with an airy white head.  Aroma of sweet toasty pale malt and sweet light fruitiness with a good resiny piny hop character.  Body starts with decent fullness and sweet caramel malts with good balance of hop flavor and bitterness.  Finishes smooth and bittersweet, nicely aged and balanced.
"
1," AUG 25, 2010 I sampled this beer poured from the bottle into a trappist glass in a fast food type restaurant in Brussels.  It poured a dark red-brown color with a big, creamy, light tan head that had good retention and little cling.  The aroma was complex with dark fruits, raisins, some roasted malt, and earthy hops and yeasty tones.  The taste was a sour-bitter medley, with some fruity sweetness too, featuring a raisin flavor.  It had a thinner but still creamy body with moderate carbonation and a good mouthfeel, fairly dry. Definitely a quality beer, worthy of its reputation.  Re-rated after trying at home.
"
1,"  raisins, figs, grapes, pears, and a bit of spicy bread.  but it also seemed to tend toward a kind of dark malt flavor, with some chocolatiness.  very much the same notes in the taste, but the grape esters stood out a bit more, as did the malt flavor, which surprised me in how like dark malt it was.  rather caramelly, but still a bit chocolaty.  pretty sweet in the finish, with a very light bitter just to keep the sweetness from taking over and becoming cloying.  thick, chewy, creamy mouthfeel, and pretty full of body.  lots of carbonation.  very solid like any other trappist ive had.  it has its own identity, and just the level of complexity id expect from a trappist brewery.  in short, very, very good.
"
1," Certainly the best of the easy Belgians.  Unlike a Westvletern or a Westmalle, all you need to do to have one of these is pull out your wallet.  Not a bad beer; in fact, its a dam fine beer.  Dark reddish brown, almost black, but not opaque like a stout.  Crisp light brown head.  Big, fizzy mouth feel, maybe a little thinner than I expected, with a spritzy fizz and a soft tannic chalky feel that lasts and lasts.  Burnt dark malt, coffee, licorice, yeast, bread, and alcohol in the taste.  Long bitter soft chalky finish.  Nice stuff.  Needs to be drunk at cellar temp, not fridge temp.
"
1," Pale and slighly bland looking bitter.  The aroma is dry and seems slightly smoked and the flavour is mildly sour but generally weak with a little bitterness.  Over quite a basic beer.
"
1," Nice looking beer.  It is a cola color with a cool tan / pumpkin head that hangs around for a while.  Aroma is sweet roasted malt and a bit of hop.  The beer itself is not as sweet as the aroma would indicate.  It is a roasted and bitter flavor and is reminiscent of a porter.  Feels smooth and creamy.  In my book this is an underrated beer at 39%.
"
1," Aroma is very yeasty-bready, almost minty.  Alcohol, candy sugar.  Body is smooth, silky.  Hints of tart fruit, malty just a bit of candy sugar.  Very smooth, carbonated just right.  Its pretty mellow and very balanced and clean.  Nice one.
"
1," Brown with a minimal head.  Nice nuts aroma.  Tastes nutty and slightly sweet but a little thin.  A nice bitter finish.  A good all around brown ale.
"
1," Dark brown in color with an off white head.   Faint aroma with a faint taste. Malty flavor with light light hops.
"
1," Head is initially small, frothy, off-white, mostly diminishing. Body is hazy dark amber, bottle conditioned. Aroma is moderately malty (caramel, toasted grain/cereal), lightly hoppy (herbs), with light notes of licorice and sassafrass. Flavor is lightly sweet, moderately acidic. Finish is lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Light to medium body, watery texture, soft carbonation. Ack!  The nose is ok, but it goes downhill from there, in the form of a bland and watery fluid.  Very likely far from fresh, but there arent any offensive oxidation notes.  In fact, the spice aromas are surprising, but may have sparked from the considerable yeast layer in the bottom of my sample. Interesting for the nose (and eye, being hazy), but thats it.
"
1," Aroma/Malty-Ligth, Appearance Head/size-small, Head/Color-light brown, Head/Longevity-fully diminishing, Body/Hue-light, Initial Flavor/bitter moderate, Finish Flavor/bitter ligth, Palate Body/light, good beer
"
1," Light amber color, poured from tap a pint has inch head. Clean crisp beer will go good with just about anything. Well rounded and something you can share with the bud light, miller light ... ect crowd & they wont run away.
"
1," How are so many new raters getting their hands on this one?  This is my favorite of the Red, white, and blue trio of Chimays.  Nice fruit, spice, clove aroma, with a taste of fruit, yeast, malt, and a slightly dry, fruity, champagny finish.  Well hidden alcohol, and a great beer, but at 80 bucks a case (or 12 bucks a bottle for us unlucky Pennsylvanians) Ill stick to the higher rated, cheaper brews in my portfolio.
"
1," First Belgian experience. Had to see what all the beer geeks talk so much about. Very pleasant taste. Sweet and fruity. Achohol very noticable. Maybe the ultimate late night beer in a goblet experience.
"
1," a nice light belgian taste.  Not nearly as harsh as most of the belgains that i've had.
"
1," 750 ml. bottle.  Pours a mud brown with off white head.  Aroma of clove, yeast, fruit, banana.  Taste reveals banana bread, spices.  Lower on carbonation than I expected, and other fruits on aftertaste.  Definitely nice, but a slightly overrated dubbel.
"
1," brown, black, color with a cloduy liquid... great taste, elegant appearance... perfect for small time drinking... overall great beer!
"
1," A truly interesting experience. Had my first one last night and was pleasantly suprised by its flavor. Great on the palate. IT had a slight fruity taste. well worth the money.
"
1," This beer certainly deserves the praise it gets across the world.  Delicious, balanced, and simply one of the best.
"
1, Gentle sweet spice frit hop malt. Appear
1," Thanks to Bobby for this!  Dark brown pour with frothy tan head and picturesque lace.  Cocoa nibs, oak and bourbon on the nose.  Roasted coffee and a creamy bitter finish.
"
1," From a bottle with the cork.  One of the fruitiest beers (somewhat black-cherry-like) Ive ever had without fruit actually being an ingredient.  This is definitely very smooth for its alcohol content--the alcohol is masked so much that youd think it had half the alcohol.  This is quite a good ale, but given its price, I expected a bit more.  Id rate it higher if it had a sharper taste.
"
1," A little heavier than their Steamboat Pale, and a good deal maltier ( I suppose that goes hand in hand) some malty, caramel notes, and the finish is a little bit more herbal and grassy.
"
1," Bottle. Really enjoyed this for a single IPA.  Very citrusy and floral. I thought there was a good malt/hop balance. Appearance is a nice copper with a small head that lasts and good lacing on the glass.
"
1," 12oz. bottle.  Malty, toasty, floral aroma, lightly sweet, citric and leafy with notes of pine, grapefruit, dusty, faintly doughy yeast and touches of light caramel.  Hazy light-medium amber color, unfiltered and conditioned, and yielding a fairly slight, thin head.  Flavors include a blend of citrus fruitiness, gentle sweetness, lightly toasty malts and a wash of faint bitterness and acidity throughout.  Rather thin, finely effervescent mouthfeel, body is light-medium.  Early on, the malt seems to make its presence felt quite a bit more, but as the finish fades away, the hop character is what lingers.  A serviceable enough Pale.
"
1," Bottle 50 cl. Courtesy of fonefan. Pours a clear deep golden with a tiny rough white head. The nose has a little sweet fruit and chemicals. Thin body, a little fruit and metal with quite some chlorine. Ends dry. Goddam awful. 160411
"
1," Cloudy amber,lasting beige head.Grapefruit hop nose. Tart grapefruit hop flavor, with mild, lingering green hop finish.Great lace. Poorly balanced.
"
1," [Cask from The Halfway House]  Fresh hoppy nose, floral, some caramel notes. Light, hoppy finish. Perfectly decent session beer.
"
1," Not bad.
"
1," Tasted in Belgium in the 33cl bottle. I really like the colour and the taste is sweat.
"
1," Huge white foams immediately climbs over the hazy deep golden pour. A rathe unsettling aroma follows where fresh herbs encounter slightly husky graininess and an obvious creamed vegetable profile that reaches its summit in canned corn nuances. Heavy hay and grasses circle this vegetal showcase. The ending result feels not so satisfying, bt I got the feeling this would be marvellous with a salad, just a bit frustrating on its own and overly grainy.
"
1," Bottle. Large off-white rocky diminishing head with spare lacing. Hazy, light cloudy amber/copper body. Heavy malt aroma of caramel, grain and nutty. Light hop and average yeast aroma. Nice aroma of cask wood, basement, brown sugar and vanilla. Medium/full body, oily texture, soft carbonation and bitter finish. The flavor is moderate sweet and light bitter. Fresh and fruity, nice beer
"
1," ml bottle). Watery brown color. Medium tan head which is mostly diminishing. Light sour aroma. Light sweet cherry flavor, with light alcohol. Short duration. Smooth finish. Slick texture. Soft carbonation. Spare lacing.
"
1," Why havent I rated this yet? Well, here goes. Pours a murky, reddish brown. Almost no head. Aroma of caramelized sugar, bread pudding and fig.   Flavor of stone, cinnamon, bread, caramel, and slight toast. Good, but expected and standard for a dubbel.
"
1," Bottled(330ml). -very good beer but theres a lot of better belgian beers, amber color, fruty aroma, nice spicy
"
1," Bu sur place le 28/8/08, en fut (10oz). Blonde peu claire, peu de collet. arome de malte sucr pic, un peu dhoublonfruit sec. Got de malte pic sec, un petit bec houblonn et pas si alcoolis. Rien de mental, juste bien!
"
1," On cask handpull at The Foundry, Canterbury.  Fruity decent brown best bitter.  Good conditioni.  Fruity English bitter.  Decent.
"
1," Good price for a good IPA. Nice balance. Bought at Whole Foods. Havent seen it in any other grocery stores, but easily a top choice.
"
1," Pours a cloudy reddish-brown with a small, creamy, tan head that diminishes to a thin skin at the surface; patchy lace and nice legs. The nose is brown sugar, raisins, prunes, vanilla, fruity yeast and alcohol. Medium-bodied with lively carbonation and a lightly astringent finish. Fruity and yeasty with notes of prunes, woody red wine and spice, the flavor concludes with a lingering blend of all the above and a light alcohol note at the finish. A very satisfying brew with a superior blend of nicely integrated flavors.
"
1," A decent brown ale. A little light on the body but it has a nice nutty flavor with a hint of some sourness. Big River is probably the best microbrewery in this beer wasteland of TN.
"
1," It's hard to review this beer while drinking it, as my eyes sort of roll back in my head in ecstasy.  Of the Chimay beers I've tried, this is hands-down my favorite although they are all good.  The malt sweetness seems to be better balanced in this one than the others.
"
1,"  very nice sweet aroma.  floral rasin/plum, caramel, hints of chocolate, woody, spicy, tart/citrus.  the pous is a nice reddish brown with a big offwhite head.  the mouth feel is very creamy.  tates of malt, plum/raisin, caramel, chocolate, hints of roasted malt,  candy sugar, a slight hint of cloviness/phenols.  sweet lingering finish.  well balacned and alocohol os well hidden.
"
1," Bag in a box at Rare Breeds BF 08.  Urine coloured.  Kinda minty.  Herbaceous.  Eucalyptus all over it.  Plus some cider apple.  Just bizarre.  A minty cider.  Quite drinkable, but oddly minty.  As the cidery isnt too far away, I will definitely go and visit.
"
1," Vanity, what is vanity, is it wanting to rate a beer with the word Beastie in it just because your internet screen name is beastiefan2k. Nah.  But I did want to try this at GABF, but never got around to it with all the other good beers around.  Then a shining opportunity came when Schroppfy rated this and well he had a bottle for me to rate, score!  Well, this pours completely black and very thick.  The visible thickness of the beer is a welcomed surprise. The head is small but strong with a sticky thick lacing.  The head itself is a nice brown color.  The aroma has a lot of chocolate and strong wood alcohol essence but the alcohol is not too strong for the thick, lightly roasted stout-y aspects.  Also there is a thick cereal sweetness.  In the taste that wood alcohol essence grows, so it interferes with the other chocolate flavors.  However, the my favorite part is the mouthfeel on this brew. Its just so thick and lusciously velvety.  There is a reduced carbonation and it is tongue coating.  I feel like the Venoms alien symbiote is taking over my tongue.  This is probably the best BA low alcohol beer I have ever had, not much competition there though. Hmmm... now I need the Beastie Barrel Porter, damn my vanity. 12oz bottle into a Chimay miniature goblet.
"
1," This is one of those beers that can carry the high alcohol percentage. Quite a vinous and fruity taste. Unfortunetly I did not have a special glass for this beer
"
1," Small bottle, pours copper/brown with frothy off-white head.  Head dissipates, doesnt leave much lacing.  Aroma lightly fruity and hoppy, with taste of smoke, caramel, light hops, and dark fruit.  Initially lightly sweet and bitter, and a bit acidic.  Nice beer, but not quite as good as Chimay Blue.
"
1," Bottle. Hazy orange amber, lowish head. Fruity strawberry, honeyish  and earthy minerally notes. Mellow, welllagererd mouthfeel. Bitter dry finish. Earthy hop  aftertaste.
"
1," Bottle/11.2 - Poured a dark amber in color with a small off-white head. Hefty carbonation.  Aroma is very yeasty, Belgian ,of course, with plenty of fruity/flowery esters.  Flavor is also quite yeasty with a slightly sour fruitiness that lingers into the finish.  As good as its reputation...
"
1," Shared in the limoon the way to Mikes 40th birthday party.  750 ml. cork and cage.  Great spicy sweet brew.  Couldnt get a clear view of the color, seeings how it was so dark.  Great high light fruity and floral sweetness.  Spiciness not overpowering at all.  Hints of white wine.  Nice.
"
1," Finally tried this one and it did not disappoint.  Fabulous darkfruit aroma with some roasty malt and a touch of yeast.  Very sweet and silky smooth on the tongue.  Aftertaste is nothing but pleasant and warming.  Ill definitely get this again.
"
1," smagt i pilsner-glas lige efter stout.
"
1," had bottle brought up to me from a freind. Nice brown murky color, nice frothy head, nose is nutty some malt sweetness. Flavor is slightly nutty a little odd fruityness and not really much in the direction of hops, dry finish.
"
1," Bottle. Short, off-white head, mostly diminishing atop a hazy ruby brown body. The aroma was heavy with candi sugar and dark fruits, plum and fig. Notes of caramel, cherry and a hint of clove and mustiness. The flavor was moderately to heavily sweet and lightly bitter. It finished moderately sweet and lightly to moderately bitter with some hot alcohol throughout. A vinegary taste floats underneath the sweet, almost cloying, flavor. Medium to full body with a smooth texture. Modedrate carbonation. Good, but the flavors do not blend together as well as they do with the best of the Belgian strong ales.

1," Magnificant!
"
1," Near perfect ... will impress even the most German of beerdrinkers and hellraisers.  Get some and make anything to go with it --- it's that good!
"
1, Deep amber. Just a touch of creamy head with average retention and some lacing.		2.5 S
1," A bright yet hazy golden colour that is very inviting....the tast is unique for a Belgian in that it is somewhat dry and hoppy, without much sweetness (along the lines of Orval, but not as intense). It is perfectly balanced and the alcohol well hidden, a very refreshing and satisfying brew.
"
1," Nashville.  Light on color.  Light on taste.  Very heavy on the yucky, metallic aftertaste.
"
1," Amber body with a lasting small head.  Nose was roasted malts and alcohol.  Nutty and floral taste with an avergae finish.  Good but not great.
"
1," Bottled 50cl. Courtesy of Quack-Duck. It pours a murky golden beer with a very tall head. The nose is rather nice and inviting with some mint sneaking in. Surprisingly sour. I enjoyed the aroma a lot more than the taste. Sticky spotty lace. Residual sugars in the finish. Thanks a lot Quack-Duck!
"
1," Actually, I enjoyed Kasteelbier a little more than the celebrated Bleu (blasphemy...!?), but the qualities of the two beers are similar.  The beginning is spicy and full, while the finish is nice and malty smooth.  If it is too warm, the palate can be very alcohol filled, but otherwise fine.  Recommended.
"
1," Pours with a frothy off-white head with a light brown body.  Aroma of brown sugar, dark fruits, yeast and malt. Tasted a little similiar to other belgians with the spices but i prefer the Rochefort 8 however it is a smooth for a beer with an alcohol content this high.
"
1," Aroma is mainly grassy hops. Taste is a balance of honey malts and grassy hops. A good session ale.
"
1," Pours a dark brown with major frothy head. Cinnamon raisin spice aroma. Malted brown sugar and spice flavor with full mouthfeel due to ample carbonation and finishes quick and dry. A beer to be savored.
"
1," Pours medium dark brown with a thick beige head that sticks around.  Fresh aroma of caramel and sugar with yeast.  Spritzy on the palate with lots of flavor.  Medium mouth feel.
"
1," This is the only Trappist beer I have tasted, so my	frame of reference is somewhat limited. However, having 	said that, this is probably the best beer I have ever tasted.	I tried the 25oz version with a champagne cork. Smooth, balanced,	dark color, rich and complex, this beer is shockingly drinkable	considering its Barely Wine-like ABV of 9%. 		I cant recommend this highly enough.
"
1," Sampled at Viti, pours light brown. Aroma and flavour of light toasted nuts and roasted malt. Drinkable.
"
1," Shiny clear nail polish shine, Nose of some funk, wormy soil, paint thinner, and vivid pear. Thick mouth with some hotness but smooth overall. soft, velvety fruits over comforting sweetness.  slight funky bite in the finish but mostly faint and smooth tail, huge warming effect though.  Flavors of pear and cantaloupe mostly.  Not mind blowingly complex, but certainly not mundane.
"
1," Botella. Clear dark amber colour. Light smoke ina roma long with well toasted malt and caramel. Flavour of toasted malt and caramel, some dark fruit, bit yeast.
"
1," This poured a copper color with a medium sized white head. The aroma is nice with some caramel, dark fruits, and biscuit. The flavor is a bit sweet with some caramel, oats, and some bananas. Slightly bitter finish. Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer.
"
1,"a lovely Trappiste ale, yeasty dry acidity, malty, light to medium body, creamy and rounded, i reckon its really good, even though its not the most insane of Belgian brews, very solid, always reliable, never lets you down in hours of need.
"
1," Pours a dark dingy ruby red sort of color. Aroma of yeast and alot of spice. Flavor is quite nutty flavored. Spice fruit and a touch of alcohol. Finish is a little sweet and fruity. Enjoyable.
"
1," Deep red color with a pale head that clings to the glass relatively well. There are fruity flavors through the body, but I felt that it was a bit to sweet. That sweetness lent and awkward aftertaste.
"
1," Pours black with a light tan head.  Has a nice aroma that has smooth roasty notes behind a slightly sweet hop smell.  Light to medium mouthfeel has a silky smooth feel.  Taste is a light roast with a creamy flavor.  Overall this is just a ok brew.  It was nice to try it.
"
1," Pours a typical American IPA color.  This thing has tons of floaters.  Might be clear if not for the floaters.  Decent white head with some lacing.  I cant place the smell but is somewhat chemical.  Tart hoppy flavor.  Not much body.  Some bitterness.  Almost no malt flavor.  This is really average.
"
1," AUG 23, 2003 pours dark deep brown. white head. complex nose. i think this beer has been described about 499 times already on this site
"
1," Clear, bubbly orange, thin splotchy head. Smells bready or toasty.Smooth palate, flavor is more bread or toast. Pretty simple, but tasty. Thanks to lithy for picking this one up!
"
1," You still cannot go wrong with the name Chimay. This one, as most Chimay's are, was a gusher from the get-go. Orangey amber color with massive and i mean massive just off white tannish head which had subsided about halfway through the enjoyment. The aroma is beaming with orange and nectarie and well as some spicey clean qualities. The taste begins with a definite fruity undertone. Grapefruit, orange and nectarine dance through my head. The ending finishes very bitterly and very dry..probably about my only markdown...a bit too much of a bittering of the palate. Overall a beautiful looking and smelling beer (as always with Chimay), but an overwhelming bitterness quelches a nice fruit and malt laden beer.
"
1," Cask at GTMW.  Poured coppery-amber with a loose cap of beige head.  The aroma picked up an interesting interplay of juicy floral notes, sweet bourbon, and vanilla.. unfortunately interesting in a way that they didnt really go together.. muted the IIPA-ness greatly.  The flavor was on the sweet side with restrained floral and earthy bitterness (likely due to aging).. lots of barrel again with sour bourbon and oak all over.. finished bourbon-ey with even more barrel.  Too sour on the palate, again with too much of the barrel.
"
1," After trying this again, I liked it much better.  Didnt seem as dry and I enjoyed the flavor more.  Also darker than I remembered.  I would have rated it even higher, but it seems like I have rated almost everything a little low.  When I get a chance to re-rate everything, Bleu will get a higher rating.
"
1," I havent had an abbey dubbel in quite some time so this was a nice treat.  Pours a solid and dense tea color brown thats very cloudy and hazy.  Head is a lavishing thick cream covering that remains until the finish.  Aroma is lightly spiced and fruity with reminders of clove, pear and plum.  Palate is silky and velvet like with perfect levels of carbonation that smooths out. Flavor shows its true colors through a rich vanilla cream profile and hides a distant yeast and spice in the background.  Some sign of the fruit detected but very faint and almost goes unnoticed.  I for sure will be buying another bottle of this again.  The best abbey dubbel i know of and thats why i rate it overall as a perfect beer.
"
1," Bottle.  Shared at Joey bigs house, this was an extra in the trade, last beer of the night.   Poured a dark black body with a dark tan head.  Bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, sweet milk, a hint of cherry fruit, and  dry oats.  Wow this is only 5% that explains my lack of a headache this morning.  Well it tasted much boozier then 5% but nevertheless i really enjoyed this bottle.

1," Small bottle poured into Chimay chalice.  Great looking beer,  reddish brown with generous head.  Has strong/sweet flavour with fruits and malts and very fizzy feel and alcohol has just the right amount of presence...goes great with many types of cheese and Ive successfully introduced many people to real beer with this. A staple of my life, highly recommneded to all.  Cheers to the LCBO for bring in a good supply for Christmas season.

1," Draft at Barley island. Hazy amber color with a moderate white head that diminished slowly and had fair lacing. Medium sour yeasty aroma. Medium body. Moderate sour citrus flavor with a smooth average finish. Refreshing brew.
"
1," 750 ml bottle. Strawberries, caramel, hints of chocolate, brown sugar, figs, and dates on the nose.  Pours a dark amber with a thick off white head.  Rich malts, caramel, molasses, dates, dark berries, spicy yeast notes, rich bread flavors.  Very nice!
"
1," Smells of that tell tale Belgian yeast. Pours a rich brown caramel color, with a small to medium head, somewhat heavy in carbonation. Alcohol is well hidden, hints of fruit and caramel. Very good!
"
1," Drank as a celebration to the completion of a first homebrew it poured to a tanish brown with a slight head.  Had a pleasant aroma of flowers and a dash of alcohol. my newest chapter in great beers produced from belgium.  First taste was alcohol but soon followed by smooth and tinglely bitter.
"
1," A very smooth beer. A very natural fruity taste to it and a creaminess you usually get from a stout. Top notch beer.
"
1," This beer tastes completely traditional, from the nose to the finish, but it is all done in a greatly polished fashion. Tons of overripe dark fruits, and dark sugars of caramel and toffee. Nothing shockingly good, but it is an extremely pleasant ale to drink. With 2000 ratings, what more can I add to this discussion? A classic.

1," Seriously one of my all time favorite beers.  Its even better when paired with its own cheese.  Cookie dough malt background with some light lemony zest, and a bit of white candi sugar glaze for the sweetness detected on the palate.  This is absolutely delicious.
"
1," 33cl. Pours a dark brown beer. Fruity aromas, slightly spicy, yeasty. Reminds me of a very spicy dunkel. The taste makes me think of one too.. But there is a typical taste of plums that gives this beer its character. Caramel, hints of licorice.. Some chocolate in the taste, spicy. The caramel presence isn t all that enoyable... A touch of bitterness in the finish. I wasn  t impressed by this beer. I think its definitely inferior to the Chimay blonde and the Chimay bleu... But still quite consistant.
"
1," The cork said 01/05, so I assume that this one is a year and a hlf old - Ive had it in the basemenet for 8 months.  About a half inch, light-brown head that mostly diminished.  Color was a nice brown.	Aroma was light malt, bread, yeast and a little roasted.  Taste was thin and there really wasnt much to it. Not much matliness that I wouldve expected.  Carbonation was still lively, but it had a bit of a metallic taste.  I think I need to find a freash one of these and compare.
"
1," Pours an attractive pale yellow body with a small white head that drapes some sheet lacing on the glass. Aroma of yeasty bread, coriander, banana, and lemon. Light bodied and well carbonated. Taste is overly spicy, with coriander and orange peel. Creamy banana, wheat, yeast, and hints of lemon and orange. A bit pretentious, but a surprisingly good effort. Enjoyable.
"
1,"  this one pours a clear, slightly darker amber color.  There was somewhat of a off-white head on it that doesnt hang around long, but leaves some lacing.  The aroma is a hair weak, but has notes of malt, as well as some nuttiness and grassiness to it.  The taste is somewhat dry.  There is a smokiness to it also.  Some caramel malts, but no real sweetness at all.  Also some nuttiness.  Not bad.

1," SEP 28, 2007 500 mL bottle. Pours a very dark brown color with a tan head. has a fruit aroma and has a malty flavor. my favorite belgian strong ale.
"
1," Golden hazy pour orange hue lots of sticky white soapy head ... aroma of floral and a bit herbal hops along with fruity yeast/light grape ..... taste is of bitter floral and light citrusy hops smooth and soft carbonation citrusy and fruity grapes on the tongue with a slight bitter/pepper on the tongue that lingers into the finish .... a smooth brew loved it no trace of the abv
"
1," Real light yellow colour, looks like pee with a thin-white head. A bit of malt and metal in the aroma. Light-bodied; Some malt in the flavour, but not much. Overall, not great, but better than some other lights. I had this on draught at Big River (owned by Gordon Biercsh) in Chattanooga, Tennesse on 26-September-2003.
"
1," Bottled.  Poured hazy medium orange with lots of chunky sediment and a short, well-retained cap of off-white head.. nice lacing as it descended.  The aroma picked up orange and other citrusy hoppage along with floral notes and some biscuity malts.. more-or-less malt-based and intriguing with the combination of elements.  The flavor had a sweet, tacky caramel base that was rum (or more accurately some other raw booze) accented.. mild to moderate bitterness of the citrus variety.. pine notes on the finish.. a bit rough all-around.  Medium-bodied and too sharp at several points on the palate.. could have perhaps used more hoppage to help the balance.
"
1," MUUUCH better than the white or the red, imho. im glad i didnt let my somewhat less-than-stellar notions toward those other two keep me from trying the bleu. 		a flowery/yeasty flavor and aroma that was enhanced by the alcohol content. not too vinous which is good. lovely deep rich brown color, slight head. 		mine was slightly warm from the bottle, so i think maybe i should stop refrigerating my stronger belgian and belgian style beers or something as it certainly tastes better that way.
"
1," JUL 6, 2007 July 5, 2007; 750ml corked bottle. As a big fan of the Bleue variety (Quad), I was underwhelmed by this one -- possibly making an unfair comparison to the former (and more substantial) style.  An exceptional aroma of tart, overripe-fruit presages a burst of similar flavor -- which quickly dissipates to a dry, slightly-watery finish.
"
1," Nice caramel color with tan head and great lacing. Great aroma of yeast and fruit, taste the same. The alcohol becomes more pronounced by the end of the glass. Great beer.
"
1," Pitch black. Excellent lacing atop the small and quite dark, tan head. A clean and expressive stout with a strong dark malt preminence. Roasted grain dominated profile, though not chocolatey, all grains. Certainly coffee-like and even hinting at liquorice, but this was much drier than I anticipated. Not a sweet dessert stout despite the use of oatmeal. Just a very easy-drinking, dry black beer with a light-medium body. No-nonsense. This could have been my favourite of the 6 Ive tried from Siboire, but the carbonation held an overly agressive bite to me, really pointy. Otherwise excellent.
"
1," OCT 21, 2005 Poured brown with a little tan head that lasted. I got the sense it is highly carbonated, but well balanced. Taste is nice and complex with a lasting fruity after taste. It wasnt like anything Ive tasted before and I loved it. Fruity, vanilla. Chimay Blue is very drinkable and very smooth. I like!!! 		RE-RATED"
1," Pale yellowish, hazy, small loose white head; delicate sweetish-malty and hoppy nose with a delicate mineralic touch; light sweetish-bitter flavour, soft MF, light bodied; mild and short yeasty-fruity finish with a certain bitterness in the aftertaste. Not bad, just a bit inoffensive....
"
1," Draft @ brewpub. Nice amber color. A Vienna shade. Aroma is sweet smoke and caramel. Flavors are subtle, buttery smoke, caramel, brown sugar (some). Continues to have a predominantly caramel and smoke finish. Is clean, thin, and unexciting but overall nice.
"
1," Pours opaque and brown, tan head slightly lighter than the blue. Aroma is nutty and spicy (cinnamon, allspice), caramel and yeast - but less dark, rich malts than the blue. Flavor is sweet and spicy with pungent yeast and a light warming finish. Medium body with lively carbonation and a complex but slightly restrained finish. Excellent dubbel.
"
1," Bottle @ OMH-tastingSour and malty aroma. Slightly oxidised. Strange medical dullness and a harsh chemical sourness. Odd.

1," Deep copper colored brew with an off white clinging head. The first drink was a hop explosion. (Fuggle I only know that because I asked) what ever they are you know their there. Each drink is better than the previous one. That first drink will awaken taste buds on your tongue that have maybe never been used. It may be short of great but not by much.
"
1," 12 oz bottle.  Pours an amber red with light, off-white foamy head.  Smells of sweet caramel malts and fruit.  Has an extremely malty flavor with very little bitterness.  It has a dry finish with slight notes of alcohol.
"
1," Good lookin beer if that really maters. Not bad, a little better than your average amber ale.
"
1," This is a great Belgian beer. I make this a staple in my beer diet as often as possible. Highly drinkable with candi sugar and a fruity ester present clearly from the yeast strain used in the fermenting process. Not overly high in the cloves coriander category which I love about this beer and seems to have just enough of everything to give it that distinct Belgianest flavor Ive come to love and appreciate over the years. A classic for sure..
"
1," JAN 28, 2003 The darkest chimay, up to the light, its a very cloudy, dark brown/ruby. Beautiful everlasting head. Understated aroma is of sugary malt, plummy fruit, some yeast, spicyness, port, chocolate (as it warms) and alcohol. Medium bodied, lots of carb bite. Nice complex flavors of plums, cotton candy, yeast, some kind of spice, port, light chocolate and others. Late bitterness to round this out. Tasty and warming. Could use a bit more body and a more assertive nose but enjoyable nonetheless.

1," Cereal mash aroma.  Barely hazy, dark straw.  Faint noble hop aroma followed by a mashed corn and graininess on the finish.  Light body; drinkable blond.  This one still has the training wheels on it.
"
1," Dark brown and red color, little beige head. Nuts, chocolate, sweetness and roastiness in aroma, nice one! Medium bodied. Chocolate, nuts, roastiness also in flavor, coffee lasts with chocolate in aftertaste.
"
1," Pours a kind of muddy brown. There was not much nose to it at all. Flavor was on the sweet side, lots of carmel to it with a bit of hop at the finish. Really could use more hop to balance the malt, but its nice.
"
1," Bottle.  Pours a deep red-brown.  Off white head that dissipates rather quickly, leaving little lacing. The aroma is of dark fruits, plums, and cherry, caramel malts, a bit of citrus, some fruity hops.  Flavor is much the same as the smell, with a bitterness from the hops coming through in the end.  Dry and very sweet plum finish that lingers.  The feeling is bubbly and leaves the tongue tingling.  Overall not bad, but great either.
"
1," Finally rated from a sample at WBF in Durham, though I expect to have this again.  I love all Chimay beers.  This one is vinous, with a deep copper pour and foamy, generous off-white head.  Stewed fruits such as raisins and prunes.  Some peat flavor and herbs, earthiness.  Very good.
"
1," 12 ounce bottle.  Pours a hazy amber with a large off-white head.  Aroma of piney hops and citrus.  Taste is piney hops, floral hops, citrus, and some malt.  Good balance.  Nice.
"
1," Deep dark, ruby red (almost brown?) pour with a sustaining off white head.  Light aroma of yeast and perhaps banana - well, now after I read the description - of course its apricot.  Full mouth feel with a long finish.  Creamy, malty, a hint salty and bitter.  Very good, consistent flavor.
"
1," Pours a brown/black color with a small tan head.  Nose is heavily roasted malt, smoke, and some chocolate...overpowering at first but becomes enjoyable over time.  Flavor is roasted/burnt malt, sweet chocolate, toffee and a dash of both vanilla and smoke.  Bourbon may have mellowed this one out, but does not come on strong, even at the end.  Palate is smooth and borderline thin, but makes it a bit easier to drink than some other stouts.  Pretty good offering...
"
1," Draft. Black color with a thick tan head. Coffee, burnt peanuts and maybe a hint of chocolate aroma. flavor much like the aroma. Slightly bitter burnt coffee like aftertaste. Not overwhelming or offensive. B
"
1," A very niece, warming Belgian strong ale. The flavor starts with a bit of alcohol and roasted malts and ends to warming feel of alcohol and winegrapes.
"
1," sweet dark malts, raisings, chocolate, dark fruits, the works! High carbonation, medium-full body, well-balanced bitterness. Id love to get my hands on an older bottle.
"
1," A solid, enjoyable oatmeal stout. Average tan, creamy head. Aroma filled with chocolate, coffee and toasted malts. Notes of molasses and vanilla. Light hop aroma, though the hops come through in the flavor. That is moderately sweet and moderately bitter, but the bitterness lasts well into the finish. Medium body, creamy texture. Soft carbonation.
"
1," Bottle to trappist glass. Pour is brown like cola with a soapy head that fades quickly, and you can hear the carbonation like pouring a soda. Aroma is bitter sweet of malt and yeast and some coco and mollasses. Taste is more yeast and malt that comes of burnt or roasted nuts and dark fruit along with some prunes. Palate is medium mouth feel and full carbonation very fizzy.
"
1," Reminds quite a bit of wine. Very fruity.
"
1," 500 ml bottle at Marhun in Germany. Pours a clear brown color, with a nice beige head. Aroma is roasted malts, over-ripe fruit, and grains. Taste seems kind of subdued malt mostly. It has a sour/nasty palate. Not great.
"
1," AUG 12, 2003 Pours a wonderful evil copper color. A great white head that refuses to die and a nice amount of lace. The taste hits your tounge in a beautiful wave of complexity that doesn't quite rival the bleu but is unique and very savory. I love this beer.
"
1," 25oz bottle.  pleasantly yeasty aroma, much like the commercial description insists.  Distinctly Belgian flavor, fruity and soft with only a hint of the hidden alcohol that persists within.  Its pretty, too. And itll knock you to the ground.
"
1," GABF 2008.  Pours black with a small, fizzy, light brown head, somewhat lasting with good lacing.  Aroma is heavy malt (molasses, chocolate, burnt), light hops (herbs), average yeast (leather) with notes of alcohol, wood, smoke, and vanilla.  Medium bodied, oily texture, soft carbonation, and a metallic finish.  Average duration, moderate sweetness, light acidity and bitterness.
"
1," Bottle purchased at Corral Liquors, in Granite City, IL. Pours a cloudy copper with two fingers of frothy, ecru head that laces well. The aroma is a slightly musky blend of floral, citric and lightly earthy hops over pale malt. On the light side of medium-bodied, the palate is slightly grainy with a bitter, resinous hop finish. Toasted malt with a solid hit of floral and faint citric hops, it finishes dry and bitter. This is a decent brew, but its certainly not among my favorite IPAs.
"
1," Bottle thanks to blutt59.  The smell is banana, clove, yeast, and alcohol.  The look is cloudy, light tannish colored.  The taste is sweet, fruits, banana, esters, yeast, and clove.
"
1," Pours a reddish chestnut color with a thick creamy head that lasts forever.    Aroma is fruity - banana and apricot - and spicy.  Flavor is of the same fruits as in the aroma mixed with a peppery spiciness.  Just a bit of alcohol warmth in the finish.  Nice.
"
1," Very strong...dark beer with thick foamy head...good taste, but if you're not ready, this one could knock you down...

1," Deep brown beer with creamy beige foam. Aroma is rich, slight burned, spicey and very malty. Taste is very deep and overpowering. It has an exotic caracter and a great afthertaste.
"
1," 0.33L bottle. Dark brown colour with orange taints. Aroma starting with malt and plum and peach bursting behind it, and a little vanila in the back. flavour is quite sweet with brown sugar and some hoppy bitterness.  Body is meduim to full and the aftertaste pleasantly sweet and sour.
"
1," APR 14, 2009 750 mL bottle. Pours a dark maple, hazy color with visible particulates from the yeast. Huge brown head that goes down quickly. Aroma is very sweet- almost candy. There are tons of cloves in the mix there too. Very creamy going down. Almost like really good spiked apple cider. Alcohol is very nicely covered up by the malts. Yeast flavor permeates until the aftertaste, which is slightly dry and malty.
"
1," A golden ESB with a thin off white head. In aroma, a light sweet malt with herbal hops. In mouth, a smooth herbaceous hops, over caramel malt, quite nice and well done. On tap at the brewpub, July 30 2011.
"
1," Dark amber hue, cloudy. Thin white head that disperses quickly.  Light earthy fruit (musty cherries?) on the nose with a hint of yeastiness. Medium-bodied with continuation of the earthy fruit on the palate. Very light flash of malty sweetness on the medium-long finish and some yeastiness.
"
1," On tap at the Disney Boardwalk location.  Pours a deep brown with a medium creamy light tan head.  Aroma of nice coffee, chocolate and roasted malt.  Flavor of roasted malt, caramel, chocolate and some coffee.

1," Pours brown, clear, with a moderate, white head. Aroma is hops and roasted malt. Mody is somewhat watery with a bit of a caramel, sweet flavor.
"
1," FEB 5, 2005 The aroma is a fairly standard Belgian spice smell.  Beige head that dissipated fairly quickly.  Mouthfeel is soft and a bit bubbly, but not too thick or thin.  The flavor is sweet, with a bit of yeast, but mainly dominated by the spice flavors.  Full flavor.
"
1," Dark coppery, cloudy color, with a moderately foamy head which lasts.  Big malt/spice nose.  Had a strong flavor, most of which were hard for me to put my finger on.  Spice, cider, fruity, with developing bitterness.  Hopefully someday Il find a 750 to see if there are differences.
"
1,"   The color is a clear copper-amber hue.  There was a little head, that dissapated quickly.  Little lacing.  The aroma had a bit of pine and grapefruit hoppiness to it.  The taste was somewhat bitter.  It had a strong, but medium bodied malt backbone, but no overall sweetness.  The oats have made the overall beer quite smooth and drinkable.  A good beer!
"
1," draft. pale gold. twangy corn and fuel faults on top of green, oily, resinous wet hops. strange burnt nuttiness and burnt / toasted grain husk character.  oily, a little sourish, excessively bitter relative to body and sweetness, though the malt is solid and with matching carbonation.
"
1," Bottle from the brauhaus (also found at Getrnke Fritze Bergtheim)Mahogany color, clear; small head. Some caramel aroma; the aroma is also lightly spicy (cinnamon; cloves); delicate and perfumy. Caramel flavor, with a very interesting spice profile; moderate residual sweetness; correct bitterness; it claims that its Reinheitsgebot and it doesnt mention any spice in it. Germany meets Belgium meets Sweden.

1," This is a pleasant Belgian that I will continue to drink, but that I think is slightly overrated.  Delicate aroma that is yeasty and floral.  Pours out a dark brown color with a large tan head that disappears fairly quickly.  Taste is quite malty and sweet with a bitter finish.  Lighter mouthfeel than I expected.  Overall, this is a good beer, but one that I thought would be more flavorful and complex.  It kind of seems mediocre now that Ive tried so many other great Belgian ales.

1," Bottle.  Pours amber with thin off white head.  Aroma of malt and bread.  Taste is mostly malt and caramel.  Thin mouthfeel.  Bland and boring.

"
1," 11.2 oz. bottle from Kellers IGA.  Pours a very dark, mostly opaque brown with amber and red tints and a tiny off-white head that leaves a film on the beer and a small ring on the inner edge of the glass.  Tried this third in a Chimay Red-White-Blue lineup.  Aroma of roasted malts, caramel, rye, brown sugar, figs, currants, spices, banana, leather, and toast.  Complex aroma, but it doesnt pop quite like it could.  Flavor of caramel and roasted malts, currant, fig, leather, tobacco, molasses, wet leaves, earth, peat, spices, and flat syrupy cola.  Medium-full bodied, with low carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel.  Complex and interesting, just not quite active enough in the nose or mouth to take it to the next level.
"
1," mint leaves, navel oranges, lemon, floral flavors, a little bit astringent and sharp at times.  Decent overall.

1," Draft sampler at Barley island. Hazy copper pour with a moderate creamy white head that diminished slowly and produced some lacing. Medium hoppy aroma. Medium body with a sticky texture. Average hoppy flavor with a moderate bitter finish of average duration.

"
1," 12 oz. bottle from grownfool- thanks again, Brian! Pours a cloudy amber color with a two-finger, frothy, rocky beige head. Aroma of citrusy and piney hops, grapefruit, caramel malts, perfume, and potpourri. Flavor of floral and citrusy hops, tea, grapefruit and orange citrus, caramel malts, and pine resin. Light-medium bodied, with medium carbonation and a bitter, resinous mouthfeel. Lingering bitterness. Solid IPA that actually drinks kind of like a double IPA.
"
1," Draught(Atlanta).  Copper color, small head.  some malt in aroma.  Flavor is better than the pale ale, but still a little unbalanced.  Hoppy aftertaste.
"
1," A dark brown cloudy beer, pops off with so much foam out of the bottle that it runs all over the place. Then it settles down quickly and has no head at all. No lacing. Aroma of malt, thyme, dark sugars, and yeast. Flavor is dark malt, corriander, citrus, and is exceptionally smooth for the style. Strong flat malt aftertaste.
"
1," Rock solid belgian, one of three from Chimay.  Pours a cloudy light brown, with a well retained creamy tan head.  Aroma is full of dark fruit, slight alcohol, malt and yeast.  Flavor is similiar, but the alcohol seems to stand out more on the tongue than it did in the aroma, and the malt also becomes more apparent.  Well made Belgian brew, too common to get excited about.
"
1," I cant add anything that hasnt been said in the 2,100 other reviews for this excellent beer, save that it might be the most drinkable beer I have ever encountered.  Remember that awful ad campaign for Bud Light?  ""The difference is drinkability""?  Bud Light is the chicken nuggets and french fries to Chimays lemon roast chicken on a bed of watercress.
"
1," This beer is rated very very highly, but ill tell you I dont like it as much as the rest.  Dont get me wrong if you gave this to me as a gift id be happy but its just too expensive and not what I would call a 99th percentile beer.  The high alcohol content gives it a huge kick, which was too much for my liking.
"
1," Clear copper body topped by off-white head.  Aroma is medium sweet, caramel, peach, some cherry.  Taste is medium sweet, peach, caramel, some cherry, light vegetal.  Light body.
"
1," Pours brown/orange with big fluffy white head. Nose is surprisingly subtle. Bit of yeast, apple, grape, touch of citrous. Taste is yeast, malt, grape. Not really as good as I expected and not as pungent or flavoursome as Chimay Red or Blue. Ive had much better Tripels.
"
1," Bottle 50 cl. Courtesy of yespr. Pours a very dark brown - close to black - with a vague tint of orange and a light brown head. Aroma is dark roast, but also somewhat skewed and odd - due to poor British hops? Medium body, low in carbonation, hard roasted malt and licorice accents. Also an odd chemical - phenollic? - tang. Dryish finish but not overly bitter. Not your greatest Porter. 280310
"
1," draft.  pale gold.  c-note american hop driven nose with light honey / cracker malt sweetness.  medium body with some chewiness and roundness.  dank, grassy, juicy, fresh, bitter, zesty with medium-high acid.  prickly buzzing finish leaving a thin oily coating.  mostly clean, yeast gives it a little creaminess and heft, and for the most part its without flaws.  tasty.
"
1," when i not getting drunk, this is my favourite beer in the world
"
1," Lovely light amber in color, moderate lacing of large bubbles - aroma of apricot and other fruits, as well as some yeastiness - subtle flavors of bread, fruits, and an almost artificial sweetness - finish is dry and crisp, with just a touch of bitterness - I still don't see what all the hype about Chimay is, but this is good beer.
"
1," after my first bottle of chimay, i still quite unsure whether i like it or not.  maybe my tastes have not matriculated into that of a true connoisseur.  the aroma and flavor was very complex, with a decent amount of alcohol.  a little bitter seems almost bitter when it hits the tongue, and then into the mouth and down the flavor changes too much for me to really track.  il have to try this one again.
"
1," You just cant go wrong with anything from Chimay -- unique, full-bodied, historic.
"
1," Courtesy of Fonefan. The color is dark, red mahogany and the head is creamy. The aroma is malty with notes of caramel. The flavour has sweetness, notes of malt, citrus, caramel and the finish has a spicy touch and its rather dry.
"
1," Bottle. Average white fizzy head that mostly diminished. Spar lacing. Clear flat light dark-amber color. Dusty grain, butter, caramel, toasted and toffee notes. Medium bodied with a soft carbonation and a light dusty/dry texture. Flavor was sweet malt with some burned bitterness. Sweet dusty and light buttery finish.

Body is medium, texture is oily, carbonation is soft. [20101225]
"
1," [Bottle] Pours a clear orange color with a nice cap of beige head. Sweet molasses and caramel nose. Some grainy notes in there as well. Moderately malty taste includes a bit of citrus and mild hoppy finish. Light metal, but overall it tasted pretty clean. Average mouthfeel/palate. I didnt think this was too bad. I actually think it would make a good transition beer for people that arent into craft beer.
"
1," Pours a mahogany colour with a beige head that lingers. Fruity aromas with notes of chocolate, caramel & spices. Palate is quite lively with a presence of fizziness, however the body is quite thin and not as complex as the other two Chimays. Still an enjoyable world-class dubbel.
"
1," APR 5, 2004 Poured a very dark brown color. Thin head. Complex flavor with malt yeast fruit and oak. It's coplexity has probably earned it the high rating, but I believe it is a bit over rated. The Red is more drinkable, and I also really like the white when it is hot out.
"
1," I paid $11.99 for this bottle to celebrate a new job. Pours dark brown but reddish when in the light. Large beige head that shrinks to a thin layer. Good lacing. Really mild fruity aroma. Taste is surprisingly mild but strong at 9%.
"
1," Sampled @ Pint Meibockfestival. Strawyellow colour, aroma of malts, hops and flowers. Taste is soft, sweet, slightly leaning towards the bitter side, dry finish. Refreshing beer. Nice.
"
1,"-/
"
1," Poured into a tulip glass. Nose is lightly sweet, not huge. The pour is dark brown and was overly carbonated as it took a long time to settle. Taste was not as big as I anticipated, a little brown sugar and mild raisin. I really thought this was going to be a bigger more robust beer. The palate was a bit thin. Overall an easy drinker for a 9% beer, just not as big as many other beers I prefer in this category.
"
1," On tap at the Bloomington Beer Festival. Poured chestnut with a light brown head. Aroma was malty with a bit of an acidic coffee bite. Flavor was well balanced with malty flavor that dominates a lesser bitter hop flavor.
"
1," Handbottle at Paps 23-Apr-2010 - Thanks. Cloudy amber - caramel, fruity, buttery, berries, light sourish, nutty, fatness, light diacetyl notes, light bretty.
"
1," Bottle 33cl. @ home.Clear medium amber color with a large, frothy, good lacing, mostly lasting, off-white head. Aroma is moderate malty, roasted, light to moderate hoppy, light yeasty, spicy. Flavor is moderate sweet and bitter with a average duration, and a dry finish. Body is medium to light, texture is watery to oily, carbonation is soft. [20081117]
"
1," Pours deep nut brown with a quickly settling head. Aroma is quite yeasty, with citrus and almonds. The flavour is of yeast and slightly fruity malts and almonds - the malts somehow seem to mesh into one slightly off flavour. Not very impressive. Wasnt a huge fan of their white either.
"
1," Cask handpull at Crosse Keys, JDW, London.  Gold, slight haze, thin white head.  Slightly nettley blackcurrant hop on a blond ale.  God Im bore of these type of beers already.  Whatever happened to malt?  Good stinging lasting hop.  Its pretty good though, bit more interesting cos of nettley earthy hop sting.
"
1," Bottle from somewhere. Pours a very dark brown with a dissipating brownish head. Nose is slight cocoa falling into a decent coffee scent. On taste, much of the same, straight forward light, sweet coffee notes. Nice body and full character. Pretty decent.
"
1," Nice sweet rose cherry aromas with beauty pour; taste rich complex sweet and dark cherry; the best Chimay
"
1," Hazy brown beer. Strong and complex taste. Roasted grain. Malty. Dark fruits notes. Quite dry aftertaste with caramel-chocolate sweetness and alcohol. Some parts of taste reminds of porto. Mid-high in carbonatio
"
1," Its unclear light-golden with a huge, creamy head. The aroma has notes of clove/yeast and a little fruity esters. The sweet flavour has notes of clove/heast, banana, hints of other fruits and the finish is spicy/yeasty. Its all in all quite spicy, but OK.
"
1," Its a good beer, but I love the triple (blanche) so much that Ill usually choose it over the chimay red.  Not to say that this isnt a great beer... strong taste of alcohol, light florals.
"
1," Bottled. Grainy and little hoppy aroma with a hint of roasted malts. Brown color, irregular beige head, few lace. Light sweet, malty, some chocolat, soft bitter at first but more present in the finish, light herbal in the finish as well. I like them more malty and a bit more roasted.
"
1," APR 24, 2008 Poured from a 750 ml to a trappist glass.  Slight off white head that goes away quickly with some head long lasting.  Good lacing on the glass.  Scent of dried fruits and toffee with some brown sugar.  Really its so complicated that every scent gives another aroma.  Taste of alcohol at first but it is well hidden with the complex flavors.  In fact, after a 750 ml, I just realized how well hidden this alcohol is.  A thicker texture but extremely thick.  Really almost the perfect beer.
"
1,"   Island Black Majic ""Tavern Style"" Java Stout is looks nearly black and opaque when poured into a glass and has a small, foamy, mocha-colored head.  Chocolate mocha tempts the nose and would be really nice if it werent for a bit of yeastiness that intrudes into the aroma slightly.  The flavor reminds me of freshly ground coffee beans blended with chocolate and roasted malt.  The finish has a nice roasty bitterness.  The flavors are all well balanced overall.  Ths beer has a medium body and a very smooth texture.  This was my second Barley Island beer and I am very impressed with their beer so far.  Both this and the <a href=http"
1,Dry apple and alcohol aroma...	appearance
1," DEC 23, 2004 Anything with a cork in it from Belgium just has to be exceptional, and i was not disappointed with my Chimay Grande Reserve. The aroma was unbelievable (i still have the cork), the color is just a beautiful amber. The taste is great, with a sweet pleasantness as you swish a little around in your mouth. After the beer goes down only happiness remains as this is one of Belgiums greatest creations thus far.
"
1," 750ml corked bottle. Dark brown with offwhite head. Aromas of dark fruit, molasses, caramel, and yeast. Full bodied with flavors of raisins, plums, brown sugar, burnt toast, and yeast. Dry finish, and slight alcohol warmth; excellent. Shared with Quintana.
"
1," Bottle 330 ml.Dark red color with medium head. Aroma caramel, fruits.Taste sweet, caramel, alcohol, bitter finish. Medium Body.
"
1," Draft in Chattanooga w/ Shag/Clash. Full amber color with a decent initial head. Retention was not as good as the better IPAs, nor was the lacing, but decent. Aroma was piney with some citrus hopping also going on. Flavor was pine and citrus hop water with some caramel malts mixed in. Pretty drinkable, yet not a stellar IPA, beatable even by many a pale ale. Mouthfeel was average for the style.
"
1," 330cl bottle. Pours a cloudy brown with thick head that sticks around. Chunks of yeast followed as the bottle emptied. Nice aroma of malt and typical Belgian flowers. Taste was also nice, with alcoholic warming throughout.  High carbonation. I new to Belgians so I learning what to expect. I think I like the Chimay White better.
"
1," Big, snow drift tan head on caramel brown beer.  Aroma is sweet malt, caramel, light dates, some spice, candied sugar, and a hint of thin, dry alcohol.  Taste is somewhat bitter up front and followed by caramel, lightly roasted malt, candied sugar, and some unidentifiable spices through the finish.  Some raisin/date notes in the mid-palate as the beer warms.  Clean and somewhat dry crisp feel in the mouth.  Solid beer.
"
1," Great beer and my first trappist brew.  The head is bubbly at first and then slowly proceeds to a nice creamy taste and look.  It is quite alcoholic in flavor.  It has a slight hint of sweetness especially at first.  A very floral aroma.  Not really hoppy or malty.  A well balanced B.S.A.
"
1," Bottle. Hazy light yellow color with a huge white head that was lasting with good lacing. Good sweet wheat aroma. Light to medium body. Good sweet spice flavor.  Soft refreshing brew.
"
1," 2009-01-10.		330 ml bottle. Freshness date on label (Best before end of 2013).		The pour is dark-brown with red hues around the edges. There are lively bubbles and an off-white 2 cm head that stays around for a while but then settles into a nice layer of creamy foam. Some lacings.		Aromas of dark fruits, primarily cherries, are present. There is also a smell of wood, and a slight sting of alcohol hits the nose.		The taste is amazing and clearly triumphs the smell of the beer. Up front are tastes of ripe fruit - cherries and apples - and raisins. Perhaps, there are also some notes of spices here. The malts provide a sweetness to the brew. A slight bitterness accompanied by pleasant alcohol characterizes the finish. Towards the end the alcohol becomes more prominent.		The beer is medium-bodied. Carbonation is lively and the bubbles coupled with the creamy foam provides a nice mouthfeel.		This is a very complex and delicious beer which I really enjoy.  		Serving type"
1," Hazy, golden to light amber coloured, visible carbonation, mid-sized fluffy ""ditry"" head, slowly diminishing; solid sweetish (wheaty-)malty nose with distinctive fruity traces; moderate to full sweetish flavour, medium to full bodied; robust sweetish-fruity finish with a touch of alcohol and a delicate tartness.

"
1," A pilsener brewed at the Big River in Chattanooga, TN. Aroma is grassy and malty. Appearance is golden with a large head. Flavor is slightly bitter with a nice malt presence. A very clean and refreshing beer. As long as you aren't looking for loads of complexity, this beer will do nicely.
"
1," Its golden with a white, creamy head, and the aroma has notes of malt, bread and flower  its mild but tempting. The flavour has a light sweetness and notes of malt, straw, flower and the finish is dry with a light bitterness. Its refreshing and charming.

1," JUL 12, 2006 hazy brown with medium head.  Really rich taste with nice apricot highlights.  Aroma is spiced and apricots and plums.  I was suprised by the level of bitterness in the beer, but it really balanced the beer well.  Nice sweetness to the beer.
"
1," bottle, mit Dank an pivnizub! Hazy deep golden colour, large white head. Intensive, sweet-malty base (very sweet!), flavours of vanilla and honey tune in. Very shy hoppy touch in the finish. Did I mention this beer is very sweet? A bit too sweet for me, still like the approach.
"
1," (on bottle) Dark, rusty orange, small, white head. Butterscotch aroma and smelly trainers. The carbonation disapears very fast, leaving a waterish mouthfeel. Ends with a hint of nuts.
"
1," (Draught)  Pours a hazy amber-brown body with a small beige head.  Aroma of toasted grain, cocoa, some raisins, and caramel.  Flavor of cocoa, biscuit, grass, caramel malt, and toasted grain.
"
1," JUN 3, 2004  Rating #100  750ml caged bottle (Grande Reserve).  Poured with a sweet and spicy full aroma of figs.  Appearance is as expected with a deep brown, with minimal head and suspended bubbles.  There are elements of a Trippel in the flavor, as the weak esthers in the nose come through more.  The dominant flavor though is a sweet malt, with some dry spices (cloves and nutmeg).  The finish is short and smooth, with a little linger of the spice.  Almost on par with Chimay Red, exceeding the white.
"
1," 33cl Bottle. Lovely aroma of fruit, raisins and caramel. Pours a medium off white head which fades quickly, dark red in colour. Flavour is initially sweet with a slightly acidic after taste which stays in the mouth for a good while. Texture is smooth and creamy.

1," The carbonation and palate is excellent. Overall, very good. A little pricey.
"
1," Pale and cloudy with a big head.  Wheaty, bananaish aroma.  Sweet, banana character but with lots of yeast spritz and wheaty tartness in the finish.
"
1," Bottle, at Mahars in Albany NY.  Nut brown body and aroma...rich with a bit of dark fruit.  Malty, nutty flavor, some caramel, starts out rather full but ends fairly watery.  A dunkel, eh?  Didn't think of that.  Not at all bad.
"
1," ahh nothing like the middle of the road!!! nice brown ruby colour, fruits malt, yeast floaters much better then the white well balanced. oh and for the sticklers available in Ontario at the LCBO and many fine beer bars... thanx
"
1," The perfect beer.  Aroma of light fruit, yeast and hay.  Taste is more of the same, plum and apricot flavors, little bit of sugarness.  Long and enjoyable aftertaste.
"
1," Beautiful head, tantalizing aroma, deep amber color.  Taste is somewhat strong at first, mellows out considerably 1/3 of the way through the glass.  Excellent beer...
"
1," Nice cloudy brown body, with a reddish hue. Creamy beige head. Pretty good head retention.		The aroma is full of fresh plums, sour cherries, and a bit of green apple. Some pleasant yeastiness, some mild spiciness (clove, cinnamon). Some roasted malts, with hints of caramel.		The taste starts out very fruity, with lots of fresh plums and some sour cherry-like tartness. Then you get some caramel breadiness, with just a hint of chocolate. The finish is still fruity, with just a bit of dryness and very light bitterness.		Exceptional is a good way to describe the mouthfeel. Its very smooth, yet somewhat crisp. Medium-bodied and moderately carbonated. Not boozy for a 9% beer. Some warming sensation at the swallow. Very pleasant overall!		The one bottle I had went down very easily and smoothly. I guess the drinkability is good for a strong ale, but moderation is strongly advised here, because the alcohol is quite well-masked!
"
1," Draft. A deep amber beer with tan head. Roasted malt scent. Taste is same with nuts and a hint of molasses?
"
1," Bottle. Light hop aromatic and honeyish nose. Golden, low visible carbonation, white lace. Light spicy honey malt base, aromatic grassy and light flowery counterpoint, dry finish, very nice balance I think. Ok chewyness for a pils. Spicy orangepeel retronasal. Quite nice.
"
1," Poured at the Charottle Rock Bottom brewery. A dark brown beer. Very smooth. Slightly bitter and sweet tastes linger afterwards. Good beer.
"
1," Bottle from Sainsburys. It pours amber, with a thick beige head. The nose is sweet strawberry, raspberry, heather and honey sweetness. The taste is tangy, almost sour orange, lemon, pith, tart raspberry, hay, marmalade and some alcohol, with a dry, hay finish. Thin body and average carbonation. Ok.
"
1," No doubt, a great beer, but strange undertones of wheat beer, which is great unless you hate wheat beer, as I do. Chimay Blue did not leave me with this feeling.
"
1," Pours a beautiful dark amber red/brown with a thick nicely laced white head. Has a yeasty malty aroma with notes of dark fruits, bread and caramel. Flavour about the same with some spicy hoppy notes. Excellent beer.
"
1," Bottle 2l at home. Nice malty and citrusy/herbaly hop aroma, slightly Weizen-ish. Taste is a bit boring, not much malt character, very unusual bitternes. Very nice head retention and just the right amount of CO2. For my taste way to watery and boring. I suspecting an off batch and il try it again on tap at the pub.
"
1," My least favourite of the three most common beers from chimay ie rouge and bleu.  It is still quite nice. pours hazy golden colour Slightly spicy with some sweetness caramel perhaps.  quite enjoyable but not crazy good.

"
1," Smells strongly of malts and grapes. Poured a nice dark brown with little head, and it left some lacing. Great flavor of caramel and different kinds of malt. Finished very smoothly, and left a great taste in my mouth. Awesome beer.
"
1," Poured a lightly hazy, glowing orange color with a small, off white head that left spotty lacing on the glass.  Aroma of pine, citrus, floral hops, nuts, grass, and sweet malts.  Citrus fruits, pine and sweet malts, bitter grapefruit, but finishes a little metallic.  Unfortunately the flavors didnt seem to come together quite as I had hoped, making this rather disappointing.
"
1," 3.7</BR>
"
1," Pours brown with a average size fizzy off white head.  The flavor is of caramel malts, with some grassy hop flavor, along with the typical belgian yeastyness.  The body is medium with a dry/oily texture and soft carbonation.
"
1," The basically tastes like Chimay red but with a little more floral and spice character.  Pour is dark hazy brown with fluffy white head.  Aroma is of fruit, raisins, heavy belgian spice, and is also sweet.  Flavor is again sweet and malty finishing with a slight raisin quality.  Good brew.  May buy again.
"
1," Pours a dark and sediment filled reddish brown with a creamy off white head. Aroma is fruity, but more your berry type fruity and somewhat malty. The flavor is lightly malty and fruity. A very lightly bitter and yeasty finish. This is very well balanced. Has an initially creamy feel that rolls over the tongue but it seems way too watery for me. My least favorite of the trio.
"
1," Bottle.  Aroma of molasses.  Murky brown body with medium fluffy head.  Flavor is filled with molasses and roasted malts.  Hint of sweetness, cherries, with an aged flavor finish.
"
1," 22. 2007. Thanks, Yem! Pours black with a wispy little white head. Big brown bread, roast, and toast nose. Nice! Creamy medium body, very light carb. Toast, roast, and brown bread go round again on the mid-palate, with a mild note of weak coffee crossing the palate at the finish. Solid, stable, well-made little beer.
"
1," Bottled. Clear pale golden colour. Medium head. Dusty hops aroma with yeasty notes. Slightly fruity, bready and with a little maltiness in the background. Mild finish. Quite okay.
"
1," Full bodied ale, light alcohol, fruity, refreshing, nice.
"
1," MAR 12, 2008 Bottle, 33cl. Pours deep reddish brown, with a thick, decreasing, but long lasting foam. A sweet aroma of fruits like plum, pear and maybe even apple, notes of yeast and spices. Starts off with a short sharp feel of alcohol, which almost tickles the tongue. Eases down to a full-bodied, lively mouthfeel. I can taste plum, pear, orange, spices and some yeast. In a nutshell"

1," clear brown in colour, with a swet caramilised malt nose, and a sweet thick strong malt flavour
"
1," Very nice appearance. Had a blackish brown look. Flavor was nutty and pleasant. Wasn't overowering. Nice beer.
"
1," It poured a nice, big bubbly head that ultimately disappeared, and it was a nice golden amber.  It smelled wonderful with raisins, malts, and a nice hops coming through.  It just tasted overwhelmingly flat though.  It starts with very fruity malts and finishes with alcohol and hops.  On the palate, it was merely thin.
"
1," Bottled (BB 11/2009)	Thanks Bjrn!	Golden color, small white head. Very papery, a bit grainy aroma. Cardboardish, sweet  malty, grassy beer.
"
1," Smells strong of yeast, and some sourness from the malts.  Very dark red color, almost completely opaque.  The flavor doesnt quite do it for me, the sourness from the malt is not my favorite.  Otherwise, it is pretty sweet with hints of spice and fruit.
"
1," This exceptional beer poured an enticing almost opaque burnt amber in colour, with a small foamy head that was retained thoughout. The aroma is yeasty and slightly floral. Quite fizzy in the mouth.  Flavours of sweet caramel and burnt malt. Definate alcohol and spicy ginger in the finish. One of my favorite beers to date.
"
1," raisin, wood aroma. Pours a dark amber. Buttery, woodiness, light hoppy finish.

1," Had at Disney brewpub .. light whiffs of banana and light clove and some fresh barley .. . great headring .. . light and refreshing and leaves a nice aftertaste .. . pretty good stuff . . pluto!
"
1," bottle - Pours mostly clear gold with a one finger white head.  It has a light, citrus accented aroma.  The flavor is light and sweet with lots of citrus.  Theres definitely some lemony flavor in there.  Theres nothing particularly impressive here, but this beer tastes alright and is very refreshing.    It probably helped that I drank it on a warm, sunny afternoon.
"
1," Black with a creamy tan head. Roasted grain aroma and taste with notes of coffee and subtle smoke.
"
1," Bottle... Murky amber ale with a small, creamy, white head. Lots of large floaties. The aroma is of dark malts and herbal hops. Bitter flavor for certain, but interesting... grapefruit rind with whispers of caramel and milk chocolate. Medium-bodied with a callous mouthfeel and lively carbonation. Finishes with bitter tannins and then bone-dry. Kudos to MI2CA for floating this bottle my way!
"
1," HELLO GINGERBREAD!!!! This is like sticking your nose into a gingerbread house to do a smell inspection. A bit sweet from malt, but mostly its moist and gingerbready. Mine filled the boot with a nice head but it dies down too quicklly, not too bad.... actually pretty darn good lacing though. The flavour is more like a beer than liquid gingerbread house, thankfully, there is just some wam notes of the ginger after the usual malts, yeast and then some faint x-mas beer spices. The taste is actually a bit flat and dill after that immense bouquet. The foam is nice and creamy, just a bit of lingering ginerbread on the mouth, nothing too strong here. I like it. Its a christmas beer that smells fantastic and then doesnt beat up your mouth with over-the-top you should only drink this once a year richness like eggnog and other christmas and oktoberfsts. Or maybe everything just tastes better out of a boot...
"
1," [Bottle] Pours a clear orange color with a white foamy nose and great looking lacing. Big and hoppy nose provides tropical fruit, heavy pine and some orange zest notes. The taste is similar, with a dry and astringent hop profile becoming dominant. Palate is chalky and the carbonation levels seem a tad low. The bitterness is more subdued in the taste. Dry finish. A nicely done IPA.
"
1," Very light and sweet aroma, with a nice pour.  Taste is subtle for such a strong ale.  Very good and enjoyable with each sip.  Unlike many beers, I can resist the urge to want to slam this down real quick.  I am enjoying every minute, its definitely a worthwhile pick. 	I would imagine this is better then the other two offerings that can be easily found here in the US.
"
1," My first trappist ale, it has excellent aroma and flavor.  I was a bit surprise by the yeast particles floating in the beer but not disturbed in the least.  Nice strong flavor reminiscent of german beer.
"
1," Nose of sugar, lots of roasted malt and some peruvian coffee beans. A light brown/orange colour was displayed...and fine head. Much too carbonated....my bottle popped like a soda can when opened and I swear I picked up a hint of coca-cola in the mouth. Chocolate and too much sugar accompanied this. Decent finish...
"
1," Cloudy, deep-brown appearance, sweetish malt and smokey aroma, sweetish on the palate with a hint of smokiness, little bits of sediment floating around here and there, but certainly interesting drinking, quite unique beer, thanks per!!!!
"
1," [330ml bottle from Waitrose, Marlow] Bottle fizzed up a little on opening, disturbing the yeast and releasing huge dark fruit aromas. Deep red colour. Taste initially strong malt and rich fruit, then a hint of coffee, chocolate and treacle, then a bit of iron which combined with the malt made it taste briefly like a health drink.  Too many floaters by the end to finish it. Aftertaste initially pleasantly malty, but with a sickly syrupy-sweet mouth coasting.  After a while fades to leave sourness.  Pleasant but disappointing - I actually thought that the Chimay Red was a far better balanced beer.
"
1," It pours a brown color with a 1 finger head that vanishes to a thin ring.		On the nose I am getting mostly mint followed by some chocolate notes.		The flavor has a good amount of chocolate up front and some roasted notes. As well a little mint present. The big down fall is that it is a little too thin.		It finishes with strong lingering mint and some faint hop bitterness. I can say that I am not a fan of mint but I am a brown lover. This is a actually not too bad. I could see it being more of a christmas time beer.
"
1," FEB 28, 2006 A sweet almost barleywine like aroma.  Cloudy red appearance with no carbination.  A tart and floral flavor with a medium body.

1," Vintage 2009. This was a bit lighter and subtler Dubbel. The flavors were enjoyable even though it didnt taste like other Dubbels I have had. Overall it was an enjoyable beer that I would gladly drink again. It didnt blow me away, but it was somewhat unique.
"
1," NOV 4, 2007 Poured a reddish amber color with a HUGE off white head.  Fruity, malty, slightly sweet aroma and I still cant get over this head.  Smooth spicy taste with slight alcohol presence as the brew warms up.  Back a few months ago, this was my introduction to Trappists, and I was not disappointed!  I drank a 2000 vintage magnum the other night and just wanted to note how awesome it tasted.
"
1," Big River-Boardwalk-Epcot Center. This beer had a medium sized tan head that contained fine sized bubbles that quickly and completely dissipated. The nose was lightly malty and moderately hoppy with a bitter and hoppy flavor that had an aftertaste. The mouthfeel was smooth and bitter and this was a medium bodied beer with fair lacing.
"
1," Intens dark brown beer with a creamy off white to beige head. Aroma is rich, generous and has hints of roasted malts, nuts, sweet bread, cookies, some spices and candy sugar. Taste is malty, sweet (candy sugar and dry fruits), nutty and it ends with a complex bitterness of hops. A great Belgian Trappist.
"
1," Aroma of sweet malts and aromatic hops.  Pours reddish brown with an airy head.  Well balanced, complex.  Tastes of cherries, bananas, grapes, and aromatic hops.  Beautiful finish.
"
1," Bottle. Pours dark deep orange, amber, Decent piney hop aroma. Flavor has a rather harsh garden weed type flavor. Leafy hops. Decent
"
1," I love the way this beer looks in the glass. Medium in color with a nice head. Once you turn the glass upward the smells start to come, nice floral scent with some yeast. Next is the taste, wow possibly the best beer I have ever had.Taste like the scent only more so.
"
1," Bottled (thanks Timo A!). Yellowish golden colour, small white head. Aroma is sweet malts, some grains and some mild fruits. Flavour is sweet malts and some alcohol. Mild grains and some herbs.

1," Dark reddish brown with mild roast malt aroma.  Roasted malt flavour with some carmel.  More bitter than I expected, but fairly smooth delivery.
"
1," Hazy pale gold pour.  Spicy aroma.  Really watery mouth-feel.  Bland spice, and citrus.  Meh

1," A Chimay  uma das maravilhas da Blgica. Fortssima, gosto marcante, voc jamais esquece o sabor.	Um brinde aos monges trapistas que inventaram essa delcia.	Ao contrrio da fabulosa Garre, a Chimay pode ser encontrada em garrafinhas, o que possibilita sabore-la at aqui no Brasil. Por isso, caso voc a encontre, no deixe passar batida a oportunidade!
"
1," Bottled@Bjrntasting. Golden colour, small white head. Aroma is herbal, buttery, wooden and also has notes of mild grass and rubber. Flavour is grass, hay, hops, some rubber and also grainyness.
"
1,  ruddy cola with huge bubbly head that quickly vanishes.  Aroma
1," This beer looked better than it tasted. To be fair, the Barley Island brews seem to be one dimensional. Seems to have too much bitter/hoppy flavor for a stout. Has the same base flavor as all Barley Isand brews so if you like the others, you will like this one.
"
1," 12 oz bottle. ..Heavy aroma with toasty and chocolate notes.  Light citusry hoppiness with peppery yeastiness. .. 	Large, off-white fizzy head that lasts. ..	Moderately sweet and slightly bitter. Long and complex yeastiness..	Med body, creamy. .. .	Great stuff.  A classic belgian beer - definately a style-defining one.
"
1," 12 0z bottle traded with Mr. Bishop from Tenn opened into a sniffer in San 	diego.  looks near black with brownish corners.  light brown 2 finger tiny bubble head.  smells interesting i think in a good way.  smells very lightly like mocha with a bit of bbq complexity.  Tastes like a typical porter with some roastiness and decently thick dark malts.  I cant put my finger on the exact interesting difference in this beer.  Still a pretty good beer but not an imperial porter in my opinion.  Overall 6.5 of 10.
"
1," (22oz bottle) Hazy light amber body topped by medium light beige head.  Aroma is medium sweet, strong pine, some lemon, orange.  Taste is medium sweet, pine, some lemon, light melon, mint.  Clean and watery light-medium body.  Very drinkable, and with its relatively low ABV and well-rounded bitterness, this would make a nice session beer.
"
1," Bottle 750ml. Poured a dark kinda murky color. Aroma of malty. Taste has a sour start with a sweet finsh.
"
1," A deep translucent garnet to brown color on the pour, the head preposterous in size, creamy in texture, light tan in color, with oodles of lace to cling lovingly to the Chimay Chalice. The nose is dominated by the malt, but also a hint of yeast and hops, sweet, and quite sniffable. Start is malt sweet, the top middling in mouth feel, the finish is potently acidic, mercifully hopped, droughty malt aftertaste. My second most favorite Chimay, and as I have stated, if you havent tried a Chimay, youve not lived Baby.
"
1," Pours gold with an off white head.  Smells of light citrus, wildflowers, grassy, crisp.  Tastes some dry malt, peppery, lightly spicy, woody.

1," Served in a Kings Goblet. 		OK beer snobs, best beer I have ever had. 	Ice cold, ribs, mashed potatoes Wonderful.
"
1," Pours a clear brown with a small light-tan head. Aroma is bready and fruity, with caramel and booziness evident. Sharp bright fruity taste, sorta tart, sweet booziness, brown sugar, esters galore, a bit of spiciness. This has magnitude but no direction. Like a scalar.
"
1," Big Bottle shared with the fam and Georgie Peorgie. Pours a hazy burnt orange/amber with a nice off-white head and beautiful lacing that lasts throughout. Aroma is sweet caramel malts, floral, and yeasty. Flavor is spices, yeast, dark fruits. Smooth. This was the first belgian beer I ever tried and it continues to be a favorite. Chimays best product in my opinion.
"
1," truely a work of art,if the monks cant have a woman this is the next best thing
"
1," An absolutely beautiful beer - deep cloudy orange/brown with a fluffy natural head.  Scent of fruit and hops. Sits nicely in the mouth - nice carbonation and a full flavour leaving a slightly bitter aftertaste.  A big tasting brew with - believe it or not - a mildly ""fishy"" taste.  Overall, a classic.
"
1," Short white foam. Clowdy yellow color. The aroma is very much like lemon. Full body with much wheat. A good winter Wheat beer.
"
1," Pour is a hazy yellow with a white head.  Aroma is cloves and banana with some spice in there.  Flavor is very spicy and corriander with notes of clove and lemon.  A pretty good hefe/wit and prob one of the best from this brewer.
"
1," OCT 16, 2009 On tap at the 2009 Crescent Moon Extreme Beer Festival. OK kids. This is something very special. Pours a dark mahogany color with a thick large dark beige head. The head retention is out of this world. This has the aroma of a barleywine except theres also lots of chocolate and oak scents in there as well due to the barrel aging. The flavor has big fruits and vanilla. Very pronounced wine from the chardonnay barrels. In spite of all these complex and roudy flavors, this is surprisingly smooth and easy to drink. An astonishingly good beer. UPDATE 10/2009"
1," absolutely delicious.  beautiful color, wonderful flavors, right amount of spiciness.  Excellent first class beer.

1," frankly I prefer teh white. But this has a slight sour cast to and is very drinkable and enjoyable. Crisp yet not biting.

1," Draught@brewpub (Portland, OR)	Pale amber-yellow color, small white head. Light brewing cereals aroma. Light palate and body. Light pale malty, faint hoppy flavors. Comes and goes.
"
1," Pours a golden color with a off white particle filled head. Particles flowting around everywhere. Just flowting. Pretty smooth on the palate. Too different for me to want to get it again.
"
1," Smells a bit of bananas, quite wheaty. This is good too. Not overly wheaty but certainly there, a nice light flavor. The glass said Wernecker Balthasar Neumann Hefeweisse, so I hope this is the same beer.

1," JUL 26, 2007 Rerate of 33cl bottle after aging for about 3 years sampled on 7/26/07"
1," Bottle, 6.5%. Very bready aroma, slightly vinous. Bready flavour, some dust. Sweetish aroma hoppiness. Hazy yellow colour. White head. Rough bitterness in the flavour, some malt. Hint of butter.
"
1," Yeasty, sugary notes dominate the aroma.  It pours a very dark amber, almost brown, and indeed the malt resembles a brown ale.   The flavor is sweet and yeasty with some floral notes.  Weighty texture with some alcohol notes.  Yeast and sugar dominate the palate, not entirely to its benefit.   I am probably signing my sentence to Hell by not writing a rave review of the Trappist efforts, but I am underwhelmed.  Both the Premiere and Cinq Cents are better balanced.
"
1," Light yellow, light body with moderate bitterness. Lace in glass. Some malt aroma, some Liberty hops, a bit grassy, balanced and neither too bitter nor sweet with some elemnent of each, good for its style. Very fresh and a good lunchtime beer when you can have a pint and still get through the afternoon.
"
1," Pours a dark murky amber color with a creamy off-white head.  Aromas of subdued fruits like raisins and dates, a touch of spice, and maybe a bit belgian yeast coming through.  Initial sweetness is good followed by the spices from the belgian yeast strain.  Some rich dark fruits really come through in the finish.
"
1," The beer pours a deep brown color. The head hangs around awhile. The flavor is very complex, I think I tasted some chocolate flavors or licorice. Definitely tasted better as it warmed. I recommend.
"
1," Golden beer with a fine white head. Mild malty aroma with some fruity and hoppy notes. Malt dominates the flavor as well. Flower notes also. Not very interesting.
"
1," APR 20, 2006 Had La Caracoles Ambree the previous night.  Found the two modestly similar.  I found Chimay Bleue more moderate, yet more well-balanced.  Blue poured a beautiful golden amber with a brownish, soapy head; in time, incredible lacing.  Fresh yeasty nose.  Sweet hazelnut malt flavor; and a mild coffee note.  Surprisingly, 9% abv.
"
1," JAN 1, 2009 Great aroma and a great pour.  Pours a deep brown with a nice white head.  The taste is nicely fruity while packing a surprisingly 9%abv.  A great buy.
"
1," i love this beer. This was the beer that gave me interest in beer. It hold a special place in my heart. It pours dark amber with a beautiful head. Yeast, bread and light flavours go down easy. Alcohol is well hidden. Its a classic beer that i can get on a consistent basis.
"
1," Sampled at the 2010 Indiana Winterfest. Poured a hazy golden amber with a small white head. Aroma had notes of cedar and pine and a hint of alcohol. Aroma started with pine notes, but the barrel aging seemed to have combined awkwardly with the beer.
"
1," Slight hops, a skunky adjunct beer. This is just something you get to tick, it is nothing more.
"
1," 33 cl bottle - Beer looks very much like the bleu, but is a bit more red. More like burgundy. Head is powerful and beautiful. Very malty aroma combined with nice banana esters. Flavor reminds one of a westmalle dubbel with a nice soft alcohol burning sensation, again filled with banana esters. Yeast is also very apparent. Not very dry, and very drinkable.
"
1," Poured into a Duvel glass.  A dark ruby and brown beer with a big cream colored head.  Lots of lace.  Low levels of the typicla rumminess, and some yeasty esters.  The flavor is much more appealing.  Chocolate, rum raisin, caramelized sugars.  Very nice.  The high alcohol of Chimay Blue do not cause this beer to come off as thing.  Matter of fact, it has a quite silky mouthfeel.  I shoul get a couple for the cellar.  Gotta love the monks.
"
1," Nashville.  Metal tasting.  Its pretty, though.  For this place the awful metallic after taste isnt quite as bad.
"
1," Very good, one of my standard favourites and the only real belgian beer in my local ""Systembolag"". A real favourite of the cheaper beers avaible.
"
1," light bodied, strong yeasty spiciness with a bitter finish
"
1," 750ml brown bottle w/cork. Reddish brown, compact off white head. Fruity aroma. Notes of spice, pepper, faint vanilla. Rich malts, some woodiness and more spice in the mouth. A bit of dry finish, some alcohol notes.
"
1," A clear copper pour with frothy off-white head and good lacing.  It has a pleasant grapefruit and pine aroma.  The medium body has average carbonation and slick texture.  The taste is well balanced with good sweetness on the tip of the tongue and bitterness at the back.  This is a nice sessionable IPA.
"
1," Absolutely, perfect! At first taste, a strong and sweet ale hits the palate, but after some contemplation, you seem to get lost in this beer! There is so much going on, yet the simplicity of the all natural trappist techniques used to brew this keeps it drinkable. Truly the best beer Ive ever had.
"
1," Hefig-frischer Antrunk, in dem das Malz zwar prsent ist, sich aber vorerst nicht in den Vordegrund stellt. Erst im Mittelteil etwas malziger, dennoch ist die Hefe weiter stark vorhanden. Das Malz breitet sich allerdings im hintergrund aus und wird etwas rstig, leicht kruterartig und schokoladig. Die Intensitt ist angenehm, fast ist der Weizenbock als sffig zu betiteln. Nun wird das Bier allerdings schwerer, auch die Hefigkeit scheint nun behbiger. Dunkel, angenehm hefig, kaum sprbar suerlich im Hintergrund. Das Bier bliebt nun auf diesem wrzigen Level, im Nachgeschmack ndert sich abgesehen von einer trockenen Ankndigung nichts. Der Bock gleitet langsam aus, absolut spitze ist der wrzige, noch lang haltende Nachgeschmack. Super Weizenbock! 9/12/12/13/11/12
"
1," pours cloudly brick red with an effervescent bubbly head. aroma is yeasty and alcohol. flavor is smooth and buttery, with a heavy alcohol taste with heavy malty tones, with tobacco and leather.aftertaste is oily and smoky. an extremely good ale, as is expected from Chimay.
"
1," Damn fine ale, great out the bottle.  I like it as it has some hop spicynesss to eat.  Fantastic.
"
1," Cant complain about this. I love it. Belgium yeast. A ton of flavor. When in doubt go chimay. I will say I like the white better...I know its crazy. This pours beautiful. Taste carmely, sweet,slightly boost and leaves your mouth clean and wanting.
"
1,"   Bottle that Nick & Anna (next door neighbours) brought back for me from one of the regular excursions up to Harris, cheers Nick & Anna, consumed 05-01-10   Pours light amber in colour with a little white film on top. Aroma is touch clean and chemically this is also the case with the taste, it is clean, and malty as the description suggest but I not a fan of the chemically cleaness that there is also, no bitterness, a little sweetness, not that great.  A5 A3 F5 P3 Ov10    2.6 
"
1," Bottle from Frugal MacDoogal. Pours pale amber with a dissipating ivory head. Aroma of cereal and fruity esters. Light bodied with average carbonation, and perhaps a little watery in texture. Very pale malt backbone that is a mix of caramel, pils, and toasted malts. Subtle but detectable hop bitterness brings this into balance. Actually a decent beer to pair with hearty food when you want to go lighter. By itself, not so exciting.
"
1," Very sweet and balanced. This dark strong Belgian ale tastes far different from its rough competitors. This beer is very sweet, a slight taste of  some caramel and it hides its alcohol percentage very well. As a matter of fact any signs of an alcohol or bitter taste are far from noticeable and it is overall very nice and malt.
"
1," Pours rootbeer color with slowly-dissipating light tan head and good lacing.  Aroma of alcohol and hardwood.  Flavor is sweet with much alcohol and some walnut-husk bitterness, hints of red table wine.  Lots of body, finishes with some plum and raspberry.  Would buy again.
"
1," 75cl Bottle.  Id say it was about 12 years ago that I first had this, it is responsible for popping my Belgian beer cherry at the ripe age of 18.  Light murky brown in color with off white foam, decent lacing and retention.  Aroma is slightly phenolic with notes of yeast and some maltiness.  Rich malty flavor with a somewhat bitter finish for the style.  Gets higher marks than it should due to nostalgia and Im ok with that.
"
1," a creamy, dark red/nutmeg body with a tough little creamy top.  A niceley spiced, floral nose withfruity hints as well.  maybe some cloves as well.  VEry well balanced.  Malt presence is sure to please most.  Sweet and tasty.  Quite a fizzy palate, and I mean above astringency here, is everpresent.  And a nice dry, very long finish with hints of  spices in there too.
"
1," Bottle. Poured an amber with good fizzy head. There was a nose of pepper and spice. The taste was great, pepper in the nose, vanilla in the after taste. Pretty good.
"
1," Bottle, medium stable head with some lacing, very hazy peach orange colour, arpma of pine, herbs and citrus with breadiness backing up, floral hops flavour with some bread and a hint of honey. Balanced, satisfying  IPA.
"
1," Courtesy of Gillard. Pours clear amber with copper edges and thin tan head. The aroma is full and rich with roast, molasses, apples, raisins, a bit of prunes and a sense of vanilla. The taste has plenty of prunes, sugar stewed raisins and a bit of red apple flowing into roast and molasses. It ends with lingering roast and fading sweetness. It seems to come together nicely into the finish.
"
1," Curious raisin and yeast aroma. Greenish dark copper color with a medium head. It has a nice initial tangy punch that gives way to a pleasant moderate hoppiness. I have found that the quality of hops this brewer uses is top knotch. Its a tad tinny, but finishes cleanly.
"
1," Bottle. Dark maroon beer with no sediment, bright when held to the light. Big soda-like head that stays around like a good Belgian should. An understated aroma of raisins, plums, and sugars. The flavors mostly overplayed by the sharp, crisp, biting carbonation. Comes across very clean. Flavors of raisins and dark malts. Nothing here is strong or overwhelming, just well balanced and delicious.
"
1," Very drinkable beer. Rich fruity flavors and aromas. But still i prefer the blue Chimay.
"
1," Atlanta.  On tap at Rock Bottom Restaurant and Brewery in Buckhead.  Didnt like this one so much.  Floral, with a bitter twang.  It was complex but somewhat abusive to the tongue.  Not that great of a pale ale.  I prefer ones not so abrasive.
"
1," floral aroma a bit muddy in apperance, hoppy floral flavor followed subtel malt nice finish
"
1," Nice banana and slight clove aroma.  Nice cloudiness.  Good wheat and yeasty banana flavor.  A refreshing wheat beer.
"
1," 330 ml bottle.  Pours a large, off-white, sudsy head.  Muddy, cola brown body.  Aroma is spicy and fruity - what a great yeast.  Light alcohol on the nose, dark caramel malt and some darker (chocolate?) malt rounds it out.  Flavor is of brown candi sugar and subtle rum, grape, cherry and caramel.  Medium, clean body with lively carbonation and a crisp, dry finish.  A very enjoyable beer.
"
1," Great looking, chesnut in colour and nice off white head on top. Aroma is malty, elegant slight fruity with some faint caramel touches. taste is elegant, and almost easy drinking for a trappist beer. Anyway, I like the straight forwardness of this beer, it has character and a clean malty, slight caramely and fruity taste. Had it straight from the fridge and loved its lightness.
"
1," 33cl bottle. Dark brown with a good formation of an off-white, almost light beige, head. Aroma is strong to caramel, brown sugar and yeasty. Flavour is moderate sweet, caramelized, burnt sugar and Belgian yeasty, with a final slightly sweet and alcoholic. Carbonation is medium to lively. Body is high.
"
1," Tap at 2006 GTMW.  Aroma of lemons, banana, straw malt. Overall fairly sweet aroma.  Cloudy straw-yellow with a nice white head.  Flavir is sweet with banana, bubblegum and grainy malt. Good, but the bubblegum stands out a bit much for me.  Light to medium body with high carbonation.
"
1," bottle-thanks to vyvvy for sharing this one at my beer tasting.  pours hazy orange with a soapy white head.  this was the point in the evening when my ratings are pretty hard to read.  nose is full of hops-big citric and pine.  orange, tangerine notes dominate.  flavors are pine and lightly resions with the citric twang in the background.  definately straight forward but solid.
"
1," Bottle. Sweet malt, prunes and caramel in aroma. Deep redbrown colour with beige head. Sweet flavour of plums, prunes and nuts with a nice slightly bitter finish.
"
1," At Seven Bridges, JAX. Pitch black, brown head and lovely lovely lacing. Mild coffee aromas, some nice coal, clean aromas. Smooth creamy mouthfeel. Mild acidity in the finish. Lots of coffee with berry flavor accents.
"
1," Nice black brew with solid roasted aroma, light bronze head. Good chocolate notes with good roasted flavors. Smooth and enjoyable.
"
1," NOV 17, 2003 Dark ruby brown, huge head.  I love it.  Aroma of spice and fruit.  Flavor is a sweet malty yeast with a slight bitterness, balanced with fruit on the finish.  Did  I mention I love it.
"
1," Nice dark copper color with a decent head. The taste is sweet and spicy. It finishes with a fruity taste of plums or grapes?
"
1," Big malty aroma - dark mysterious fruit. Clear reddish brown with small head. Oddly appealing flavours - nutty, fruity, sweet, caramel. Light mouthfeel - a touch thin. Bottle.
"
1," I had really high expectations for this being my first tasting of the Bleu.  I would say that it underachieved.  The aroma was fairly uninspiring.  The appearance was a lovely ruby brown.  The flavor was a pleasant chocolatey strong ale.  Still searching for that killer belgian that I can use at home tastings.
"
1," Had this by the bottle at the Boston University Pub.  Slighly drier than the white, if I remember right.  It was okay, but not remarkable for the style.  Not exceptionally strong tasting, though, which is a blessing.  Not something Id go after specifically, however.
"
1," A wonderful dubbel. The pour is cloudy mahogany with hints of ruby red. The aroma is rich and yeasty with huge malts. Sweet and slightly bitter taste with tons of esters of apricot and raisin. I love the smoothness of the beer with almost no carbonation. Beautiful silky mouthfeel
"
1," Not quite as good as the Bleu, amberish copper color, excellent soft head, fruity aroma, lots of malt in the aftertaste, another great brew from Chimay
"
1," about as good as it gets. Beautiful color, wonderful scent and rich flavor.
"
1," lovely colour nice taste
"
1," APR 18, 2004 Chattanooga Big River location.  Pours thin, black and uncarbonated. Nutty smell, with some dry spice (cumin?) also present in the nose. Iron Horse has a coffee flavor, with a dry and smoked finish. This may sound appealing to many, but this profile too far from my preference for a sweet stout for this to be a personal favorite.
"
1," Bouteille de 33cl. Une brune avec une mousse agrble mais pas trs abondante. Pour sr, cest une bonne bire mais je trouve quelle manque un peu de corps et je lai trouv un chouilla acide. Elle saffirme en se rchauffant. Trouve au clier des arcades - Arras
"
1," This is the most commercial and therefore the well-known  belgian trappist-beer. Good as a standalone drink, but very good with beef. If youre are able to, try to to let the beer be stored for a few years.
"
1," SEP 1, 2008 Both 330ml and 750ml bottles. Delicious clear dark red/brown body with a good beige head. The aroma is sweet malt, dry fruit and demerara sugar. The flavor is also sweet malt, some dried fruit type raisin or date, caramel, alcohol, spices and yeast. Maybe the sugar are drowning some of the other impressions compared with the Chimay Blue. A complex beer, but not a true classic. I remember this beer as a lot better some years ago.
"
1," Pleasant spiciness in aroma and taste.  Goes down smooth.
"
1," Bottle. Medium sized tan head and fine-small sized bubbles. Uncarbonated, opaque and a reddish brown hue. Malty, hops, wood, toasty, whiskey and a slight spicy note. Flavor of coffee, bourbon, smoky and malt. Smooth palate and fair lacing.
"
1," Bottle. Pours deep brown with nice creamy head. Aroma of plums, spice. Malty palate. Nice sweet finish.
"
1," The aroma is barnyard, roasted and caramel. Dark brown color, light brown head, good lace. Too sweet, tastes like a stronger version of their dunkel and nothing more, caramel, light roasted malts. Long, sweet finish.
"
1,Light nose..	appearance
1," 1.5L bottle.  Pours a clear (initially) reddish dark brown with a thick and reasonably persistent head.  Aroma of dark fruit, yeast, spice and alcohol.  Fruity, spicy and yeasty flavour, mild sweetness and medium sourness.  Medium bodied, lively carbonation, quite smooth on the palate with a sour, turning slightly bitter finish.
"
1," Who could honestly go past a bottle of Grande Rserve Chimay and say no thankyou! This is an ale that has been tasted by near everyone with any interest in beer whether they have any inklings towards its roots or not. A background favourite of mine I waited until I had cracked a 2001 before rating this. 	2004- Poured into its own chalice at around cellar temperature. Extremely muddy with the yeast dispersing into a pulped fruit mess inside the cola brown body with an enormous, creamy beige crown raising up and persisting for the length to trail fine lacing down the glass. Heady aroma, quite woody almost oak-aged with fresh pulped zesty plums, red wine dryness, spicy yeast and an underlying earthy mustiness like old hops. Lovely smooth and almost creamy mouthfeel; vinous notes set it off and develop into an earthy woody mix of malt and hops. Plums and blueberries, driftwood, peppery alcohol and yeast phenols and a hint of pecan pie develop to linger long in the mouth hiding that 9% ABV. Warming and homely, this example seemed more woody than most that I have tried with a long finish that was like a well aged plum wine. Seemed to have more age than the 2001. Quite nice. (75cL, Nookenburra) 	2001- Poured into its own chalice at cellar temperature. Quite clear, deep ruby red with a tinge of brown. Head formed off the pour; extremely dense and creamy beige, held in place by streams of very, very fine bubbles to leave a mist over the glass as I drank. Pungent and tart, port-like nose with an immense spicy waft of alcohol and the famous house yeast. Other dried fruits were there with a lick of bitter/sweet chocolate and a touch of polished Jarrah (?). Extremely wine-like in the mouth; mellowing, smooth and yet prickly across the tongue with a good dose of medicinal alcohol that didnt hinder it at all. Blackcurrants, raisins and those distinctive plum notes abound, this was like an after dinner elixir to stir up the rawest of emotion, by the fire with a loved one perhaps. Finish is as smooth as silk letting the alcohol warm to its full extent along with a deeply vinous  roundness and depth. I love a good strong ale, and Chimay delivers with fervour. (75cL, Vintage Cellars, Adelaide)	 As I said who could go past a Chimay!
"
1," This was at The Big River Grille in downtown Nashville wanted a stout but waiter suggested this and it was fantastic.  An oatmeal flavor to it.
"
1," Thick tan head with smallish bubbles.  A very dark brown beer, quite like a cola.  Smell is quite inticing - yeast, alcohol, and bit of malt.  Lively in the mouth, like previous reviewers have noted, quite Champagney.  Flavor is yeasty, slightly caramely and a tad fruity.  Finishes alcoholy and dry.  Its quite mild in a way, and very pleasant.  A relaxing beer.
"
1," Bottle at Brouge, Richmond. It pours a dark ruby/brown colour with thin beige head. The nose is caramel, toffee, marzipan, sweet blood orange and marshmallow. The taste is lighter than anticipated (medium-bodied), caramel, cola, oak, smokey, vanilla, date, molasses, lime zest, dried pineapple and bread with a smokey-wood finish. Its complex, but the well-hidden alcohol makes for easy drinking.
"
1," This was my last Chimay to try, and I have to say that I have been completely unimpressed with them all. For this price range, I expected much more. This is nowhere near the Rochefort or the St. Bernardus. It pours a very dark brown with a tan head that dissipates quickly. Plenty of alcohol present in the aroma as well as some fruitiness. The taste to me was the real let down, just like an average belgian--only with a higher price tag. I wouldnt buy this one again--period.""
"
1," Almost like a champagne head, and quite a bit of carbonation, but through it all is a really nice malty flavor, and a complex elegance of delivery that makes you feel like a god!
"
1," Pours a dark rusty brown with a voluptuous creamy head.  Sweet caramel, bready, Belgian yeast aroma.  Body has light carbonation, good malt balance, and a dry woody profile.  Palate is silk spinkled with candi sugar.  This beer is done well.
"
1," A very nice bronze color, looks rich, with a nice collar of cream-colored foam.  Lots of citrus in the aroma, grapefruit pith with some fruit and soft caramel behind.  Flavor is quite nice.  A solid, full-bodied, toasted caramel malt that does not show itself in the aroma, the citrus and grapefruit pith hop character, a little viscosity that is fleeting, and a smack of bitterness that complements nicely but is probably too strong and acidic for a pale ale.
"
1," Had this with a friend in Knoxville. Dark color, looks as if it would knock you off your chair. Lovely head, bubbly. Lasting head on the glass. Citrus/floral aroma and very smooth taste. Much better than the Red.
"
1," dark reddish color.  strong taate of nutmeg with a full-bodied flavor.  its alright

1," 33cl. bottle from a local beer retailer. It pours a murky brown liquid with some amber tones (and some ruby as it evolves) and many little yeast spots, with a gigantic consistent and pillowy beige head (tainted brown by a nice yeast sediment) that lasts beautifully throughout the beer and leaves some good lacing. The aroma is mostly malty, with caramel, brown sugar, some hints of banana and a slight citrusy hoppiness. There is also a good deal of roastiness and bready yeasts. It tastes kind of likewise, but intenser and more complex, some dried fruits suddenly appearing as well as a faint brandy-like touch. A nice spiciness is also there. It is medium sweet, a little sour and has a pleasant notable bitterness. In the mouth it feels thick and mildly carbonated, with little bubbles coming alive inside the mouth, very slightly prickling the tongue. The body is medium, giving the brew more drinkability. It finishes rather dry and bitter, with a sweet caramelly and nutty finish along with some floral and citrusy hoppiness. The presentation is smart and very trappist-like. I love it; cant help it. It might be somewhat overrated (not much, though), but the feelings towards some beers go beyond the metrics. A nice way to celebrate my 200 ratings.

1," On tap in Nashville.  Black color that redefines the notion of black.  The description that it is ""boldly aggressive"" really rings true and is cool at first, but gets annoying the more you drink it.
"
1," On tap at the brewpub 6 oz glass. Dark brown color off white head. Very complex aroma and taste. No alcohol taste this one will sneak up on you. The best pumpkin ale, I have had.
"
1," On tap at the Disney World Boark Walk location. Poured a very dark orange color with a small sized off white head. Aromas of stronger citrus (mainly oranges) and some caramel. Tastes of lemons, grapefruit, and somewhat nutty. Lively body.
"
1," JAN 3, 2011 Dont bother with smaller bottles when it comes to the Chimay trilogy.. more than most beers 750mls are essential with Chimay. Chocolate,malt, floral grapefruit,dank suggestions & the type of  spices that are probably illegal unless youre a Monk and pray all day.
"
1," Bottle, 33 cl. 	Smells a bit like metal...	But taste is very nice, a bit sweet and very sparkling. Colour is wonderful.	Undoubtedly the best of the Chimays existing.
"
1," Bottle. Poured a slightly hazy (as far as I could tell) dark chocolate amber with a good creamy head and plenty of lacing. Aroma was much more subtle than expected, with very little hint of the high alcohol content. Subtle sweet caramel malty notes. This extends through to the taste which starts sweet and malty and finishes with a slightly dry alcoholic bite. Mouth is quite creamy, I think the carbonation is about right. This is a very smooth, subtle strong dark which seems to improve with each sip.
"
1," Bottle, 5.2% as Schffler Bru Premium Gold Export. Sewery bread aroma. Clear golden colour. Nice, stable white head. The flavour is quite sweet, actually a little sugary. Has a fine aroma hoppiness but unfortunately there is also some of the same sewer notes as in the aroma.

1," Pours a deep foggy mahogany, nose is huge on spaces, raisins, dark fruits, body is thin with heat, rich and complex, nice belgian candy sugars, delicious beer.
"
1," Bottle pours black with a tan head.  Smells like mocha coffee.  Has a silky medium mouthfeel.  Taste is coffee, chocolate, some alcohol, and has a nice roasted malt finish.  Overall this is a nice brew for the style.
"
1," I thought this beer was quite good!! Color is a deep, deep red with a light tan head. Aroma is very low but a maltiness is noticable. Taste is huge and very long lasting. I notice nectarines (dark citrus), raisins, cherries, caramel, and a finish of slight alcohol and brandy. Alcohol in finish is more of a compliment than detriment. There were many very fine champagne-like bubbles (seemed high on carbonation but not uncomfortably high). Overall very lovely and quite tasty.
"
1,"  Aroma of dark fruits, raisins, dough, yeast, malts, and spice.  Poured copper/burgundy/orange in color with a large, foamy, rocky, beige head that lasted throughout.  Clear.  Very sparkling.  A few large particles.  Sweet, metallic flavor.  Tastes of dark fruits, raisins, yeast, and hops.  Medium body.  Tingly texture.  Lively carbonation.  Metallic, hoppy, raisin finish.
"
1," Bottle, courtesy of fonefan. It pours a clear, golden body and a small, off-white to beige head. Grainy and fruity aroma, hints of honey. Its very grainy in the flavor, the hops, both flavor and bitterness, plays second violin. Medium body, dry. Metallic, bitter finish with hints of grains. Not my favorite at all, although with some pleasant elements. 110128
"
1," Bottle. Pours a deep cloudy brown with a firm beautiful beige head. Sweet aroma. Taste is sweet of plums and toffee, with a touch of roasted malt in there- finish is faintly bitter and dry. 9%???!!! cant smell or taste it, amazing. My favorite chimay.
"
1," on draft in the proper glass at Theresas in Wayne, Pa. Beautiful fluffy white head with a burnt orange appearance with an unfiltered cloudy haze. Nose is of all things Belgian. Sweetness, spicyness, and malt. The yeast gives this such complexity for a Tripel that it is many things going at once on the palate and nose. The hops and yeast in this are a perfect match. The fluffy head lasted the entire way with sticky lacing too. My favorite Tripel for sure. Preferred on draft although by the bottle is damn good too.
"
1," On draft as their special beer when I was there. Nice malty flavor and aroma, this was one of their better brews.
"
1," Bottle. Crimson pour with a light tan head. Aroma of grassy, earthy hops and toasted malt. Flavors of brown sugar, light earthy hops and toasted malts. Medium body with toasty/earthy notes throughout...soapy in parts with a toasty/soapy finish. Not bad.
"
1," Sampler at the Nashville location - Poured ayellow amber in color with a whitish head that lasted a while.  Aroma was weak, but had some malt and was slightly sweet.  Flavor was also not strong, but matched the aroma fairly well, so no surprises (unfortunately).  Finish is slightly sweet.  Not very good, but could be drinkable if nothing better was available.
"
1," Bottle. Smooth with a orange-redish body. Hints of fruit with sweet finish. Very Nice.
"
1," soft (in between Jack and brie), very bitter, and has a ton of charcoal/burnt meat flavor.

1," dark amber color with a medium head that shrinks quickly.  Floral smell of hops with a bit of yeast.  Tastes of malt and yeast with a bit of hops.  Nice medium mouthfeel.  Those monks do no how to make a good beer.
"
1," Bottle pours a rich, dark brown color with a thin tan head.  Aroma of yeast, dried fruits, and burnt sugar.  Flavor is slightly sweet, roasted malts, and dried fruits.  Alcohol presence is noticeable, but not too strong.  Great aftertaste that lingers for a while.
"
1," Good roasted aroma.  Lots of chocolate malt in there.  A very smooth stout.
"
1," Bottle into my Chimay chalice. Nice thick foamy head is quickly dissipating. Notice the caramel brown color is lighter than many dubbels. Rusty rain, cane sugar, and caramel apple in the nose with hints of light fruits. Medium body with perfect amount of carbonation. Taste is similar to nose. A classic dubbel.
"
1," Yum!  I love all of the Chimays and this one is no exception.  Lots of yeast and hints of raisons.  Thick feel on the tongue.  Overall GOOD AS HELL!!!!!
"
1," Bottled 04/07. Dark brown pour, foamy tan head, good lace, somewhat cloudy. Nose is fruit, raisins, yeast, sweet malt, alcohol. Flavor is raisins, sweet malt, yeast, fruity, alcohol. Finish is moderately dry, but not too astringent, with a hint of alcohol. Mouthfeel is carbonated, smooth, and warm. Wonderful!
"
1," Pour is thin reddish brown with a small late forming head.  Nose is malt, sugar, and alcohol.  Flavor is full of fruit at first.  It is very sweet with some alcohol.  Faint spice notes and some chocolate covered cherries. Brown sugar shows up late.   Feel is thin with just the faintest zing.  Sugar is overdone and dominates totally.
"
1," corainder, cumin. Some chocolate/coffee there too. 	Sweet sour taste. Heay bready yeasty with an orange / orange peel background. Light alcoholic tinge. Dry finish with some coffee bitterness. Well-balanced beer.
"
1," Pours a murky brown with a tall and thick light beige head. Very sweet fruity aroma, scents of Belgian yeast, spices and dark fruits like raisins, maybe some brown sugar/molasses too. Very smooth beer. The fruit comes forth in the beginning, but the long dry finish and the warming in the stomach is the most notable feature. Good if you like elegant, subtle flavor play between the spices and fruit.
"
1," Poured from a 22oz bottle and served in a tulip.  This beer poured an almost black with some mahogany highlights and a one-finger thick head of tan foam that quickly faded into a thin cap.  The aroma of the beer was made up of chocolate, dark fruits, and some earthy, fruity yeast esthers as well.  The flavor of the beer consisted of spicy yeast, chocolate, plums, raisins, and a hint of smoke.  The mouthfeel was medium-bodied with a decent amount of crisp, aggressive carbonation.  Not bad.
"
1," Excellent piney/citrus aroma.  Pours moderate amber with reddish notes.  Good hop flavor - rather dank and marijuana like flavor with some citrus.  Moderate body.  Overall, a solid IPA, though it would be better without the weed flavor.
"
1," Malty & complex.  Fruit & alcohol on the nose, but I didnt find it overpowering. Cloudy, deep amber appearance. I only had a sample so I didnt check the bottle for yeast, but it had a chewy/yeasty kind of feel.  Excellent flavor though - sweet, fruity, all kinds of flavor here. I see why people love this!
"
1," Dark brown beer with a tight but quickly evaporating head. The taste is rich with syurp and herbs; anis and coriander. The taste is a little alcoholic and warming, anis and syrup. The mouthfeel is a little too carbonated.
"
1," Bottle, BB 2007.  Great looking dark amber-brown with an enormous white head. Wonderfully complex aroma, with notes of raisin, caramel, yeast and warm spices.  Some notes of pepper and a bit of alcohol sneaks through.  Very smooth in the mouth.  Has a dominant raisin character, slight sweetness with a long herbaceous finish ending in crisp hops.  Taste is not as complex as the smell, but still a fantastic beer.

1," Smaller bottle. Pours a cloudy brown body with a fizzy medium light tan head. Fruity, malty aroma with some hop notes. Flavor of berries, malt and some nice sweet caramel. Alcohol was hidden very well. Thin finish. I have been waiting to try this beer for a long time and I suppose I was expectiong someting epic. Definately not a bad beer, and something I am going to try again.

1," just classicly good. this should be as bad as beer gets like this should be like budweiser or something. the world would be cooler that way.
"
1," Amber tone with white head.  Aroma is grapefruit and citrus.  Well balanced - not too hoppy and not too malty.  Nice bitter hop flavors, although not too strong.  A little sweet.  Heavy lacing.
"
1," One of my favorites.  Quite malty with a very nice yeasty presence.    Fruit aromas/taste not overly powerful.  Not too sweet likewise.
"
1," Typical brown ale aromas. Dark brown color with a beige ring for head. Medium to full body with fizzy/creamy carbonation. Flavor is roasted caramel with a good amount of non-descript bitter. Its ""sweet"", but not very. The bitter tends to balance it out. More like an APA where the malt got a little too intense. It does seem a tad floral, so that may suggest English similarities. Its a damn good drink, and I suggest it is somewhat underrated.
"
1," Amber to nut brown with a huge off-white head, good lacing.  Huge wheat aroma with a sweet and malty nose.  Wheat flavor with caramel notes.  A little dry to metallic finish.  Medium palate, dry and warm.
"
1," Caramel hazy color, sweet malty flavor with hints of brown sugar and caramel, definitely some molasses and dates as well... Aroma of sweet malts... Alcohol content extremely well balanced and leaves a lingering sweetness on the palate... Delicious
"
1," Bottled@Bjrtasting. Golden colour, small head. Aroma is marzipan, sweet malts, hops, some mild sugary notes and also some grass. Flavour is very sweet alcohol, bready malts, marzipan as well as mildly spiced. Pleasantly balanced.

1," Well, what the hell. The last beer disappointed so I figured that I would continue the trend. Deep red brown pour with a thumb thick light brown fizzy cap that faded out to a ring. Shitloads of strong minty chocolate as advertised. There is also some roast and a touch of herbal and some cld coffee in the background aaaaaand thats about it. The taste is likewise huge with mint chocolate, duller coffee, roast, weakest of bitterness - almost out of batteries on my phone. Tasty stuff, good frisky carbs, very good finish. I like! Go figure.
"
1," Tasted on a recent visit to Rock Bottom in Charlotte, NC. Pours a dark brown with a thin off-white head. Aroma is malty, hints of grain, bread, grass and sweetness -- caramel or toffee.

1," Black with a ruby tinge, and a dark tan head. Big aroma of bourbon and malt with some roasty edges. Thin body and poorly balanced flavour, like a weak stout topped with a shot of sweet whiskey. A real let-down, especially after it smelled so good...  [Toronto Christmas Party 04]
"
1," When I first started drinking the Bleu, my roomate and I were trying to figure if the Bleu was beer at all. It certainly tastes quite a bit like many of the wine products I have sampled over the years. One of the most original beers I have tried and liked. It rich color and taste lead to a strong aftertaste that sits with you for a while. The alcohol content is definitely felt.

1," A rich flowery scent undertones of malts and yeast Pours a Dark opaque amber brown. Flavor starts of sour yeasty deep and rich undertones of fruit  moves into a malty flavor with a light coffee bitterness Finishes yeasty and lingers nicely. No lacing a little watery and tingly/bubbly.

1," Tap at the brewpub. Nice amber pour with thin head and good lacing. Light spicy hop aroma, good caramel aromas something slightly metallic about it that is a bit off though. Taste is quite bland, Ive never been impressed by this style and this beer is no different. Light malty caramel flavors, hops add a bit of spiciness, the whole is very attenuated. Palate is lightly carbonated and thin. Good for knocking back pint after pint, but nothing impressive.
"
1," SEP 11, 2010 330mL  bottle - pours a dark, reddish brown with an off-white head. Aroma is a typical Belgian strong one. Flavour is milder than youd expect, but pleasant - yeasty, hints of caramel, brown sugar, but very potent. Likable, drinkable and enjoyable, but this one is overrated.
"
1," Bottle looks really good, the beer in the glass as well. A bit darker than exspected, nice head. Starts a bit moldy-yeasty, modest sourish, some fruity notes of apricot. Finish well balanced, not as moldy as the beginning, quite drinkable. Not bad!

1," Pour is reddish brown with nice white head. Nicely spiced. Dark fruits, raisins and brown sugar in nose and taste. Rated 7/1/02
"
1," Strong grassy hops abound and are detected from a great distance. Hints of dry pale and caramel malt. As the hops fade, there seems to very little left. Golden liquid with a moderate off-white head and nice lace.  Solid, yet, somewhat grain malt in the front that give way to a herbal grassy bitterness in the middle. Finishes slightly crisp, but there is a touch of metal/mineral that distracts in the linger. Certainly not one of the worst euro strongs out there.

"
1," I dont think this porter is nearly as good as their bourbon barrel-aged oatmeal stout.  Deep red-brown body, medium tan head.  Roasted chocolate aroma with plenty of bourbon (wood and vanilla).  The flavor was dominated by the bourbon, which would be great if I was writing this review on www.ratebourbon.com, but Im looking for beer here.  The underlying porter is just too weak to carry the barrel flavors.  There is just a touch of roasted malt and light sweetness associated with the actual beer.  A let-down considering how good the stout is.
"
1," Bottle looks simple, but good, beer in the glass zippy, nice head. Starts quite spicy without being too much, a bit grasy, also some hoppy-dry notes in the background. Prickly finish, still fine spicy, modest sweet. Not bad!
"
1," Dark golden brown color with little foaming. The smell is yeasty, hoppy, very bitter! Starts extraordinarily bitter, very hoppy, very dry. Unfortunately, there are hardly aroma hops noticeable. The finish is long-drawn bitter-hoppy dry, again no aroma hops noticeable. Unfortunately not as good as expected!
"
1," Undated bottle drunk on 8/10/06.Medium-high to high clarity in this bronze/tan-tinted dark brown beer.  Some light burgundy tresses when held to the light.  Off-white/beige head is initially retained at about one-finger, but rapidly fades to a ring, with fizzy carbonation running about in the liquid.  No lacing.Oxidation, DMS, soggy, nutty, stale malts, some light metallic character and plenty of pasteurization in the nose.  So thats nice.  Zippy bitterness on the end, but it almost seems more carbonic and artificially derived, not very hop-like.  Some soft brown sugar notes, rather putrid toffee/caramel and almost no yeast apparency, perhaps some acetyldehyde.  Well, that will be about enough of that.The flavor is somewhat oxidized, with a cardboard flavor.  Sickly sweet, almost syrupy, underattenuated malt sugars are simple and find no balance.  My friend mentioned the whole tea aspect, so its funny that other people saw that, and that certainly is a note I find in many dunkels.  This however, is just flawed on many levels, showing very poor lagering time.  Mouthfeel is fizzy, then watery (apart from the syrupy sweetness).  Some light yeast dryness on the end, but its a last ditch effort and quite failed.  No alcohol apparency.  To the drain with you.
"
1," OCT 15, 2010 Pours a murky dark brown color with an amber tint to it.  It is topped with a fizzy moderate sized head.  Head tapers off a bit but a bunch of frothy lacing remains.  There is a spicy fruitiness to the aroma but its faint.  The flavor is malty with a sugary dark fruit flavor.  Some spice mixed in. Pretty well balanced and smooth.  Id rank this third among Chimay beers behind the White and Blue but this is good.
"
1," Pretty flat for a wheat. Just not much going on. A few spice notes and some light citrus going on here, but nothing much that grabbed my attention. Might be good for someone who liked this style though!

1," Bottle Murky dark brown ale with a tiny, creamy, off-white head. Decent retention. The nose is roasty and spicy with a bounty of aromatic hops and a dash of anise. Medium-bodied and milky with laid-back carbonation. The flavor presents dark fruits, toasted malt and some spiciness. Plenty of hop flavor without the messy bitterness and mildly tart. Finishes tangy, lightly spicy and roasty. Bottle courtesy of illinismitty!
"
1," JAN 28, 2005 Had on tap at the brewery (1/05).  Nothing very special about this beer, but I did think it was one of their better styles (I a pale ale drinker and I did not like their pale ale attempts).  I could not detect much aroma but what I  did note was nice and malty.  I found the beer to malty as well as crisp and well balanced.
"
1," Pours black, opaque, medium tan head. Aroma is quite interesting, sweet raisins, winey, chocolate, oak. Its lovely.  Creamy, slick, moderate carbonation. The flavor falls flat though. Sweetness up front is followed by a completely muddled strong porter middle and a bitter, slightly sour, very stale finish. I think this ones a drain pour. Bad bottle? Bad beer? Not sure. Not enjoyable, regardless.
"
1," Poured a dark brownish color with a foamy off-white head.  Aroma is a bit fruity with lots of yeast and some caramel.  Raisins and brown sugar too.  Taste is smooth and not too thick with lots of fruit and raisins.  Yeast flavors give it a slightly creamy texture.  Alcohol is pretty well hidden, but there is a slight warming sensation in the finish.  Overall pretty sweet.  Good stuff.
"
1," Aroma of yeast and raisins, a bit of roast. Reddish brown light head. Taste is basically the same as aroma but with a hint more roast and less yeast-i-ness than the aroma. Palate is very dry (not my favorite) almost too dry. It doesnt really linger at all. Overall this is a good, not great, beer.
"
1," Sweet aroma.Head is thick with lacing all down the side of the glass.Flavors of plum,bannana and caramel are noticed. Nice yeasty finish. Another good chimay.
"
1," Ive had this beer before, and maybe my tastes have just changed or maybe there was something wrong with the beer but it seemed watery - not in mouthfeel but in taste. The aroma was nice and its a beautiful looking beer in the proper glass, but the taste was simply sweet yeasty water. Disappointed this time around, but Ive got a 750ml bottle, and if its an improvement Ill re-rate this.
"
1," Chimay Red has a medium, beige head and a cloudy, rust-red appearance, with lots of carbonation. The aroma is of prunes and sharp spice. Taste is likewise of prunes, cinnamon spice, some banana, sweetness, and water. Some alcohol is picked up as well. Mouthfeel is medium, and Chimay Red finishes wet, refreshing, and delicious. This was actually more light-bodied and easy-drinking that I had suspected. Overall, this is a terrific beer, and I rate it outstanding. RJT.
"
1," Transcription of an old BA review from 01-16-2010, with scores adjusted to RB scale. Will re-rate...someday.		330 ml into Chimay chalice. BB says 2013.	The pouring results in long-lived light tan head atop of hazy coppery fluid with reddish depth. Head slowly dies out until a thin soapy film is all what is left. Malty (not sweet!) aroma, unburnt toast, raisins, hint of plum and perfumy almost rose-like alcohol.The flavor profile is malty although far less sweet than expected - more alike of bitter caramel, with raisins, toasty bread crust bitterness and soft alcohol leading into dry finish. As with Chimay White the individual characteristics are somehow indecisive and I cant easily pinpoint at any although they are clearly delimited. However, the beer is very well balanced and refined with individual flavors/aromas in tune with each other. Medium bodied, medium carbonated. This dubbel is not nearly as fruity as that of Achel or Westmalle but it was the red friar that once introduced me into Trappist ale world and ignited my curiosity about other monastic brews, so Chimay Red , I owe you so much.
"
1," 330 mL Bottle. The label is marked with a ""serve before end of 2014"" best-before date. Murky deep copper-ruby body with a pale beige foamy head that settles to a clingy ring. Aroma of roses and cherry candy as well as malts and roasted malts; there are nuances of wine and wild berries. Flavor! Wow! This is a chart buster but here I have to give it the limit of 10. Okay, Il transfer the bonus points where I can. Wild berries accompany the malts in the mild but delightful sweetness. There is a wine-like expression in the aftertaste, a cherry cough drop linger, and then a nice clean finish. This beer has tied on my scoreboard with its own sibling,  Chimay Triple / Blanche

1," Pours a nice dark mahogany color with a very thin white head that dissipates quickly.  The aroma is delicate with dried fruits, yeast, and malty sweetness.  The flavor is similar to the nose, with the fruit flavors and a caramel sweetness being the most prominent flavors.  This all wraps up with a nice dry finish that is refreshing since the body is relatively thin for such a flavorful beer.  Overall, it deserves the reputation that is has as one of the best Belgians that you can find most anywhere with a decent beer selection.

1," Ooo the second of the chimays!  Nice pop to the cork with this one.  Hazy yellow color to this one.  White fritzy head.  I smell yeast!  Some carbonation and maybe some bananas.  Has some hops in the aroma as well.  Pretty interesting smell.  Taste is more bitter than I would have expected.  Tastes fairly carbonated with some nice honey flavors near the beginning.  Alcohol is slightly present in the aftertaste.  Pretty delicious beer.
"
1," Dry fruity overrated brew that goes to shit if there is some age on it and tastes like cardboard. The palate is good though and this is still very drinkable if reasonably fresh.
"
1," Bottle - Thanks hopscotch! Pours a dark auburn/ruby with a bubbly cream colored head. Malty aroma with mild chocolate hints, cinnamon, and evident oxidation. (It had been expired for five years) Very oxidized flavor. Gained some metallic/musty bitterness. Somewhat watery mouth feel with a toasted, mildly chocolaty malt character. Seems like it possessed a decent malt profile, but the rating suffered due to the heavy oxidation. Not bad though.
"
1," Poured a very dark brown with a decent light brown head.  Wonderful aroma similar to Chimay White.  Raisins, soap, cork, and prune.  Taste is like light desert wine.  Light with dark fruit flavorrune, raisins, and a little leather.  Finish is very warm and sweet.  Among Chimays, I prefer the White; the flavor is more balanced and subtle.  The Blue has too much fruit in the flavor; tastes similar to prune juice and desert wine.  I prefer the white.
"
1," The Sailor Hagars IPA was undoubtedly better when it was brewed on premises in North Vancouver. However, it remains one of the finest BC IPAs. Reddish-orange color. Strong nose with distinct hops and grapefruit notes. Citrusy throughout the bouquet and the taste too.
"
1," Cloudy and flat when poured. Certainly	doesnt meet my definition of a strong pale ale.Not a pleasant drink at all-resembled drinking alcoholic mud.
"
1," Bottle. Pours cloudy brown with a fizzy beige head. Aroma is like peeled apple skin, with hints of caramel and spice. Medium body. Flavor has a general fruit sweetness, as well as a light spicy note. Nice.

1," FEB 11, 2004 Very good. Hints of Belgian chocolate, the kind you may find with a little liquor inside. A very good beer.
"
1," Another fine beer from Chimay.  Unbelievable flavor.  Just a hint of bite but not enough to lock up your jaw on the first taste.  Drank this while sitting on the back porch swing on a warm summer evening.  Went down smooth and did not feel the buzz until I stood up!
"
1," Beer pours a nice rust brown, has a very creamy light head that smells of fruits and berries. This beer has a nice mouthfeel very smooth and velvety. Slight bitterness, definitely notes of hops, berries, a bread note as well. Nice beer, had this many many times just now rating it. Try this one.
"
1," Amber coloured. Lactic aroma of yoghurt. The flavour is malty with quite a lot of lactic notes.
"
1,"  Bomber, split with friend.  Finally I get a chance to try Chimay!  Pours an attractive ruby brown that is cloudy.  Aroma is of malts and spices, a wonderful blend that I cannot do justice to by description.  Features an smooth flavor of soft malts, brown sugar, caramel, roasts, wood and alcohol.  There must also be some fruit notes in there, because this beer is rich and complex, without sacrificing perfect crisp drinkability.  The soft carbonation brings out the flavors.  Of the BSAs Ive tried, this tops the list.
"
1," Pours hazy dark golden brown.  The yeast is strong with a hint of citrus and a bready undertone, very earthy and fresh.  Has a great flavor thats fruity, oaky hints and very complex a ful palate and many tastes of greatness some unexplainable only in the taste it can be described.
"
1," Belle rousse.  Odeur un peu faible mais caramel alcool.  Got un peu fum, caramlis, chaud et alcoolis.  Un Scotch ale acceptable.
"

"
1," Pours a dark, almost opaque brownish amber. Nose of roasted malts, dough, dried fruits. The dried fruits are there in the flavor, too--sweet with a mild hoppy counterpoint. Nice, full mouthfeel. Solid Trappist offering, but not stellar.
"
1," from bottle, nodescript concoction. Not sure it quite deserves some of the low ratings though. clear golden colour, definite malty aroma and flavour that lingers. Sessionable.
"
1," Poured a cloudy, dark, light milk chocolate brown with a slight red tinge. A frothy tan head dissipates quickly into a translucent tan film. Aroma is spicy with hints of fruit and chocolate.  Palate is light cream with a mild, soft carbonation.  Taste is incredibly complex, dark chocolate, dark cherry and other dark fruits such as raisin.  The sweetness is pervasive  maybe a hint of caramel.  Alcohol is present, but comes across as red wine.  There is a nuttiness, but it only emerges for a second out of the fruit.  Spiciness includes cloves.  I could contemplate this one for a hell of a long time.  An incredible beer.  As complex as Ive ever had.
"
1," On tap at Rock Bottom in Atlanta.  Poured a clear amber color with a thin whitish head.  Aroma of malt and nuts.  Flavor was caramel, malt and a slight hop finish.
"
1," NOV 26, 2006 0.33l bottle at home. Guys you described it well. I will just add that there is quite a difference if you drink it cold or around 12C. Do not rush, wait few minutes so beer can worm up a bit  and you will enjoy every sip of it. Such a nice creamy mouthful! One of my favorites. Very good trappist.
"
1," Pours a dark gold, hints of copper. Light tan head, ok retention, not much lacing...The aroma was really nice, lots of orange, super sweet, nots of pine and caramel on the finish...The taste was really nice. It was sweet enough to make it drinkable but balanced by some nice hops light pine.		Overall, a super solid ipa, worth trying but not actively seeking out.
"
1," Poured a dark brown-reddish color with nice creamy off-white head that lasted a while.  The attractive aroma is of caramel and fruit.  The flavor is malty up front with the taste of dark fruit and a slight bitterness at the finish.  Mouthfeel is rich.  Another one I have to thank my brother for introducing me to.
"
1," Dark Mahogony coloured beer with a deep complex array of flavours including raisins,roast malts, spices and a distinctive yeast flavour. Such an easy drinking beer for a 9%er. It shouldnt be hazey, its bottle conditioned, the yeast is supposed to be left behind in the bottle. Its all in the pooring technique.
"
1," Appearance is a very dark , rusty orange/amber in color.  Smells consists of slight yeast with some apparent spices.  Carbonation is above average, head is an white/tan in color, and lasts until the beer is gone.  Lacing is moderate.  A very smooth mouthfeel to it and goes down quite well with a slight aftertaste to it.  Overall a very enjoyable beer.  I have been waiting to try the Chimays and after sampling the Red I will try the other styles.  I will be going back to this and have some available for just sitting back and enjoying a really good beer.
"
1," Draft at Downtown Chattanooga location		About as standard a brewpub brown as you can get. Nice typical malt character, with nutty aroma and sweet toffee finish.
"
1," On draft at Seven Bridges in Jacksonville.  Pours a dark stout brown with a tan head.  Nose is a nice amount of roast, dark chocolate, hints of black coffee, and earth.  Flavor is similar with dark flavors all around- dark chocolate, roasted malts, and hints of earthy coffee.  Medium in body for a stout with such low alcohol, and nice overall.
"
1," (0.33 l bottle, BBE2010, at Kaisla on 2008-06-11) Orange and cloudy. Quite big white dense head. Yeasty and fruity nose. Full and quite dry palate, quite carbonated. Malts and hints of chocolate in taste. Bitter aftertaste. Bit harsh. Perhaps too young.
"
1," Tasty delicious stout.  Nutty, creamy, roasty, and smooth.  Nice hop balance too.  Yummy.  Good job.
"
1," This beer confused me.  I had trouble describing the flavor.  It did grow on me over time, however and I may edit this rating as I learn more about the style.  Initially, it reminded me of the smell of a red wine with hint of fruit and malt.  It was a hazy amber with a big head that quickly dissipated, but left nice lacing on the glass.  The flavor is malty with a hint of cherry and very little hop flavor or aroma.  Overall I did not enjoy this beer.
"
1," bottled, thanks to cavie, clear yellow with a sour lemon aroma, flavor is sour lemons also with a thin finish
"
1," draft. gold color.  prickly, zesty, assertively bitter hops - slightly cheesy / musty with a heavy dried grass character.  medium-bodied, a bit under-	attenuated for bitter, leaving it a tad too chewy and syrupy, but the malt is firm and snappy, hops are aggressive with bright acidity and the yeast is mostly transparent and clean.  clean, bright, snappy, well-made and delicious.
"
1," Th aroma was light chocolate and caramel with a slight bit of acidity and a fruity nature which became more toasty as the beer warmed. The beer arrived dark brown with a beige well lasting head which laced the glass. The flavor was toasty and a bit nutty with chocolate and caramel. The flavor was a bit fruity on the palate with a light sweetness and no notable bittering character. The finish eventually became dry without any real aftertaste. The body was medium with a moderate level of carbonation and a creamy texture on the palate. Just a tad sweet, but a decent brown ale. Pint at Rock Bottom in Charlotte.
"
1," 650ml Bottle purchased at Sailor Hagars. Beer has good body and hop bitterness. Pronounced grapefruit flavour. Overall, this is an enjoyable IPA and more than worth trying.
"
1," Pours the color of dark brown sugar with a thick head.  An opaque, ruddy appearance.  A thick head that rises like dough resting of a warm shelf.  Malty taste with a finish approaching a dry wine.  The 9% ABV gives a good warming effect, though its not a huge body ale like some other warming brews.  Very nice.
"
1," I fell in love with red, proposed to white, but im ready to settle down with the blue. From the lightly fruity aroma, to the pillow-like head, to the smooth fruit and maybe even slightly oakey flavor this is a classic! Perilously drinkable for 9%abv.
"
1," 50cl bottle from the Hogs Back Brewery Shop. A hazy gold colour with a fast fading white head; the aroma is full of tropical fruits; the taste is quite sour and fruity with a medicinal aftertaste; the alcohol is quite evident; and the whole effect is slightly disturbing. Not to my liking.
"
1," This was a very robust beer that should not be taken on an empty stomach as the 9% AC is something to be respected.  The essence of coffee was portrayed by the roasting of the hops.  Like the Chimay Rouge, this was a very enjoyable beer and I would recommend it to anyone.
"
1," I cannot possibly say enough good things about this beer.  It has now become my favorite beer.  The complexities are immessurable, and it hides the 9% alcohol well.  I love this beer, and highly recommend it to anyone who wants to have great, great beer
"
1," Dark brown and cloudy body with tan head. Yeasty aroma with raisin, caramel and some citrus. Sweet and toasted malt taste. Mild alcohol. Lightly dry and toasty. Very good beer.
"
1," Sweet vanilla porter.  Bitter and sour.  Slightly creamy flavors -- melted ice cream.  Tasted like too much vanilla extract -- fake, overly sweet, and artificial.
"
1," the quadrupels. I know its not really in the same category, but it feels like it shouldve been, particularly when the rest of the Chimay series (rouge = dubbel, blanche = triple) kinda promises a quad at the end of the series. It also seems to aspire to reach f.ex. Rochefort 10 in complexity, however failing to do so. Nevertheless, good value for your money and a very nice beer in general.
"
1," on tap-pours an off white head and gold color.  Aroma is medium malt, herbal hops.  Taste is medium malt-caramel, some herbal/spice hops.
"
1," Bottle at Melting Pot in Montgomery.  Obviously a very good beer but the aroma and flavor were a bit lacking - just never really came through for me. From the appearance I expected a bigger bolder taste.  All that being said - very smooth and rich in the mouth - velvety.  Beautiful appearance and a great looking foamy head.
"
1," Poured cloudy amber, beautiful frothy head. Aroma is very pleasant, wheaty, yeasty. Head lasts, with lacing. This beer is nice on the tongue. Taste is slightly bitter, but the aftertaste smooths to a wine like character. It is overall a pleasant experience that I will drink again.
"
1," the aroma is metallic and yeasty; the body is thin and dry; the flavor (some dry caramel and roasted malt) is metallic too. Wrong.
"
1," FEB 27, 2006 33cl bottle. Reddish brown beer with thin beige head. Yeasty malt nose. Good choc malt in mouth with acidic dry hop finish. Good length with choc flavours. Thought the White was the best of the 3 Chimays.		Re-rate.  Well not really.  I had a 1990 33cl bottle in The Kulminator 24/2/06.  Musty, sherry aroma.  Sour in middle and on end.  Sherry, raisiny and a bit thin in the mouth.  Very musty and a bit disappointing.  Sourness was a bit of a surprise.  Some toffee but the mustiness overrides the subtle flavours.  Glad I had it.
"
1," JAN 23, 2010 Colore nocciola/caramello,schiuma bianca spessa e durevole,aroma maltato e di lievito.Gusto complesso con note maltate,dolci di caramello,un p di luppolo,lievito.Non devo aggiungere altro, una birra paradisiaca.
"
1," 33cl bottle. Served in a Chimay glass. Pours orange tinted golden with a 3 fingered head. Slight haze with lots and lots of fine bubbles. Aroma is light fruit, honey, spice (pepper), and floral. Taste is sweet and malty pils malt, light fruits (pear), some mild alcohol, & black pepper. Finish is slightly tart & bitter, but balanced. This is a pretty tasty beer and a nice example of the style.
"
1," Pours dark brown with a small but attractive and long lasting head. Little aroma but I do have a cold!. Nice carbonation. Warming, malty taste with herbs, caramel and flowers. Raisins and scotch whisky also present. Alcoholic finish. No bitterness whatsoever. Would go for Rochefort 8 instead. Fair comparison though.
"
1," 12oz bottle-pours a disappearing brown head and black color.  Aroma is bourbon, vanilla, dark malt/oat, dark tart fruit.  Taste is bourbon, vanilla, dark malt/oat, dark tart fruit.  Occasional.
"
1," Ahhh, Chimay blue....  Somebody had me drinking this stuff long before I knew anything of belgians.  Great beer, dark reddish brown color with malty aroma and flavor, and some wine like flavors from the yeast.  Amazing.
"
1," Bottle from Morrisons (!) Attractive red brown colour. The head retreated into a thin covering quite quickly. Aroma of plummy fruit, bicuity malt, hint of cardboard. Rounded mouthfeel, spicy peppery finish. Not the beer it once was, but tasty nonetheless.
"
1," Wow.  Just realized I have never rated this beer.  Chimay was really my first introduction to Belgian beers... in Amsterdam 11 years ago.  Always a favorite, but one that I dont drink nearly enough.  Lovely bready, yeasty nose with strong apricot and almond paste aromas.  Really lovely.  Some darker fruits and malts on the palate, and a bit of alcohol considering its only 7%.  Often has some metallic notes which detract a bit, but I do love this beer.
"
1," Chimay Blue was one of my first tastes of what the Belgium Trappist beers have to offer. One of the most important rules for drinking this beer is to drink it out of proper glassware. It really releases the full flavor which is what its all about. Great beer when you want to sit back and enjoy some of the finer things in life.
"
1," 22oz bottle acquired in trade with Sephiroth (thanks!). Poured a deeper reddish brown color with an averaged sized off white head. Aromas of roast, some chocolate, toasted grains, and light coffee. Tastes of licorice, chocolate, caramel, chocolate, lighter roast, and some spices.
"
1," Thanks to decaturstevo for sharing this one at his Februmergency Tasting.	Deep gold body with a whit head.	Toasty, nutty (almost peanuty) malty aroma.	Nutty with a nice bitter balance.
"
1," Poured a dark amber color with a grand fluffy head and excellent lacing. Spicy aroma that almost reminded me of lemongrass or cilantro. The mouthfeel seemed on the thin side, but the flavor was good-toasty sweet maltiness, chocolatey and with a vague sourness. Finished short with a light hoppy bitterness. Growler from the Nashville location.
"
1," Had afew times but never got around to rating this...how odd..is this beer forgetable, well, no...just with white and the blue, this falls in between like all middle kids....?...anyway, looks nice in a glass, real respectable looking lad...gripes.....smell is all that and a bag of chips, like most doobes....taste is pleasing, grinnnninng like a bastard....this is a good beer. its also aval everywhere, but lower the price a couple bucks, then the world would jump and scream...well, even mark dell liked this stuff so, people if he liked and i liked , try it, not the best (vest) dubbel but it is solid and happy ....over and out..
"
1," 12oz bottle. Lots of malt, quite possibly lots of caramel malts because it comes off as overly sweet even with the large amount of resiny hops. The hop bitterness is there, but the flavor and aroma contribution seems minimal. Big mouthfeel, lots of carbonation. Not the way I like my IPAs.
"
1," Tap.  Brown sugar and toffee aromas mix with caramel malt and milk chocolate notes.  Pours mahagoney with a tan head and spotty lacing.  Hoppy and caramel malt flavor with chocolate notes.  Creamy and medium bodied palate.
"
1," Chimay Premiere is a hazy raspberry brown ale with a mostly-diminishing, splotchy, sand-colored head that leaves good lacing.  It has a tart aroma of straw, cherries, and perhaps dark bread, molasses, herbs, figs, butter, sweat, earth and cheese. It is dry, fizzy and medium bodied; sharp and dry like Champagne.  It is lightly sweet and bitter, moderately acidic and tart.  There is a musty quality that one would expect in a wine.  It is a well-blended and focused flavor thats hard to pick apart.  Great balance!  The aftertaste is clean and lightly bitter with possibly a hint of coriander.  A classic.
"
1," Weak aroma of malt and nut.  Taste is malty, with a little bitterness.  Smooth finish with a little spice.  Very nice non offensive Dubbel.  But it lacks the punch and character that the top ones have.
"
1," Of the three Chimays (rouge, blanche, bleu), this ale has the most malt.  It pours a dark brown with a fair amount of head that quickly dissipates (actually, a lot of the head moved to the center of the glass giving it an appearance of a giant nipple).  Light flavors of spice and fruit (raison flavors in all the Chimay ales) that are mostly masked by the roasted malt.  But for a high 9% ABV, this is a very drinkable ale.
"
1," MAR 28, 2004 light copper color, medium head with so-so last.  not as cloudy as I like an ale of this sort, yeast kind of playing it cool.  good drinking beer when you're ""having more than one"" and overall very mild for [a trappist ale] my liking.
"
1," Bottle 500ml. w. swing top.Clear dark amber color with a average to large, frothy, good lacing, mostly lasting, off-white to beige head. Aroma is moderate malty, grain, toasted - caramel, mash, sour yeast, wood notes. Flavor is moderate to heavy sweet and light to moderate bitter with a average to long duration, caramel, light chocolate. Flavor is total different to aroma ! Body is medium, texture is oily to watery, carbonation is soft. [20101214]
"
1,"  nice smooth	malty flavor, mildy fruity, but served	via nitro and thru a restrictor disc	(stout tap).  Thus, overly creamy and lacking	some of its original flavor.  I could tell there	was a pretty good beer in there.  Aroma difficult	to detect.
"
1," Small bottle from Press Club in Portland, OR--Poured a dark brown-aubergine body with a one finger white fluffy head that quickly dissipated.  Malty, spicy nose.  Rich, nutty, molasses, toffee, saccharine notes.  This is one of the all time greats!
"
1," Faintly cloudy light tan coloured beer with thin head.  Faint honey aroma but this is more prominant in the flavour.  Thin body, some fruitiness.  Could use some more bittering hops, but still refreshing enough.
"
1," Poured from 11.20 oz bottle. Poured a hazy copper color, very small head that faded quickly. Aroma of dried fruit. Slight carbonation. Taste of light apples, almost cider like, raisins, sugar...Slightly sweet up front, but not overwhelming. Slightly bitter tart finish that was really quite delightful. This is an excellent Trappist Ale. The best I have had so far...Flavors very well blended!
"
1," 33cl bottle. It was my first trappist and my first great beer. I loved it. I should retry it pretty soon.
"
1," Medium gold, decent head, tiny bubbles.  Aroma was hay hops and a bit of grain, actually pleasant, if not spectacular.  Flavor was grainy, grassy hops, and something oddly fresh I couldnt put my finger on.  Not bad at all, to my shock.  This apparently is why I keep purchasing bottles with lettering I cant read.  Every now and then you get a bit of a pleasant surprise.
"
1," On tap at Siboire. Amber color hardly any head. The aroma and taste of spicies.Also in the taste malt and sweet caramel. This is different as an Abbey Dubbel.
"
1," 75 cl	Brown/black	Beige/withe head	Spicy and fruity	Very good beer, with lots of taste.	My no.1 CHIMAY

1," with a little more hopping this could have been a nice beer.
"
1," Huge Head! Had a good clean taste to it. Very enjoyable.
"
1," Barley Island makes some of the best looking/smelling beers I have ever encountered.  Luckily they usually taste good as well.  This beer is no exception.  Very dry and hoppy with a twinge of a sour aftertaste.  Good stuff.
"
1," JUL 19, 2004 750ml bottle.  Pours reddish-brown with a large, lasting, fluffy head.  Aroma is mildly malty with some yeasty notes, but uninspiring.  Thin body yields simplistic flavours that disappoint.  The typical full, sweet, and fruity flavours that one expects in a Dubbel are only vaguely apparent, with more off-putting cardboard flavours in the background.  There has been a lot of controversy surrounding Chimay over the last few years concerning ingredients, recipes, and cost-cutting, but who knows where the truth lies?  Having enjoyed this many times in the past, I can only say that this is not the same beer that built Chimays worldwide reputation, nor the beer that will sustain it.  	Update (7/19/2004)"
1," ""Heavy cream scent with accents of cocoa and vanilla. Sweet with a big bitter push and ample creaminess. Roasted nuts, fudge, burnt toast and wood. A half inch head sits atop a dark brown body leaving good lacing. Nice one here.""
"
1," black pour with huge head...aroma is a little weak for a porter, with hints of chocolate, bourbon, and coffee....good mouthfeel....flavor was great (bourbon, cream, coffee, and chocolate with a touch of smokiness)....a good porter overall
"
1," Overall I was disappointed in Chimay based on its rating.  I had a bottle on July 10th, 2007.  The flavor starts off with a smooth, caramel sweetness but about mid-swallow the flavor fell off and left a bitter taste.  St. Bernardus was much better and followed through on the taste.
"
1," dandelion, liquorice, slight hints of peach. Fairly bitter in taste, full bodied and rich, I certainly noticed the astringency mentioned in the brewers description which makes this a beer to enjoy slowly.
"
1," <i<Bottled. Dark brown, very lively head. Light vanilla aroma. Medium sweet and fairly roasty, somewhat overcarbonated. Balanced barrel character, notes of honey. Fairly low bitterness.
"
1," One of my first coffee stouts. And its actually made with espresso, not coffee, from a local coffee shop in Chattanooga. Looks black with just a little bit of light shining through, not completely opaque. Smell is of roasted espresso(coffee) and chocolate, hops are barely detectable. Taste has a lot of espresso in the front of it with chocolate and malty goodness going on. Really good taste. Lots of roasted qualities. Moutfeel is definitely thin for this, especially for a stout, but its not weightless, just needs some more body. Even though the mouthfeel is lacking, I drank about 6 of these in a night and could have had more. I love coffee stouts. So if you dont like coffee or espresso, stay away, but otherwise, this a good choice.
"
1," APR 17, 2007 11.2 oz bottle. Last of the three Chimays to be sampled, I liked this one...much like the others. Very solid beer, nice aroma, great taste, nice alc 7%. Solid all around.
"
1," Dark rich brown beer with a touch of ruby and an off white head. Stunning sweet yeasty nose with complex fruit qualities. The flavour is full, doughy and perfectly balanced between sweet and bitter and the dry peppery finish is just lovely. A great dubbel.
"
1," pretty strong offering from a small outfit in SE Portland. Not their best beer, but a good start.
"
1," Black.  Medium palate.  Tall, lacing foam.  Light bourbon in the flavor and aroma.  No so much that it ruins the beer. Sort of delicate, and subdued flavors.  Enjoyable.
"
1," A 12-oz bottle shared by joebrew. Pours a golden pale blonde brew with a thin off-white head that dissolves to a fine film. Aroma of sweet corn, a touch of wheat and straw hops. Taste is lightly carbonation, medium body with loight wheat taste. No yeast flavor or even in the aftertaste. The palate is tingly on tongue with a smooth and thin character. Finish is clean cut, with a slight sweet aftertaste. A unique wheat beer that is more like a multi-grain with a lager character.
"
1," Clear, medium brown body with a thin ring of white bubbles on top.		Smell"
1," Almost no light shines through. Heavy sediment floating around, good lacing a the head starts large then dissipates to a 1/4 inch. Smells doughy with raisin notes and a light alcoholic lingering. Very sweet, good yeast and malty flavor. Probably my new favorite Belgian Strong Ale. Delicious.
"
1," Flowery, hoppy aroma.  Copper with thin head.  Flavour had mild fruit notes and hops were distinct, but had some soapy notes.  Bitter start to finish.
"
1," Bottle shared by IMtheOptimator.  Sweet, chocolate and coffee aroma with some vinousness and a bit of bourbon in the background.  Mostly opaque dark dark brown color with a HUGE tan head.  Very carbonated, bubbly and roasted coffee flavors to start with some sweet sugary notes to follow.  The bourbon makes some mild cameo appearances in the background.  This has just the right amount of barrel flavor.  This beer is too carbonated, though.
"
1," Pours an opaque dark orange color with a very thick head even after a gentle pour.  Very yeasty aroma with hints of fruit.  The flavor is very sweet at first, but tarter fruit flavors and the alcohol bite quickly take over.  A nice smooth drink.  Not my favorite Belgian, but still very, very solid.
"
1," 33cl. Nice colour, medium carbonation. Smells typical but tastes rather flat for a abbey dubbel. Not to compare with westmalle dubbel for sure.
"
1," FEB 16, 2008 Wonderful floral aroma.  Great balance of aromatic hops and rosted malt.  Subtle combination of flavors.  Clean smooth finish.  Beautiful, subtle, complex beer.  A nice change of pace from the hit you over the head with malt and hops American RISs and IPAs
"
1," This was an interesting find at a roadside liquor store in Kokomo, Indiana.  My first impression was that this is very reminiscent of the Dark Horse stouts- it pours very dark (but not so ""molassesy"" as Dark Horse stouts) with a large tan to light brown head.  Nice complexity in the aroma- licorice, toasty sweet malt, molasses, and bourbon.  Bourbon comes up big in the flavor too, with woody, vanilla notes that complement some sweet roast and licorice.  Also had a slightly smoky flavor.  Very good but needs a bulkier body and a denser palate to reach excellence.
"
1," Bottle.  Light yeasty aroma with some sour vacuum cleaner.  Clear golden with a white head.  Lightly bitter, lightly wheaten taste.  Medium body with a trickle of carbonation.  Doesnt really have any character or style features - on the order of BMC, but with fewer headaches.  Not a lot here!
"
1," bottle from el corte ingles, lisbon. Livey carbonation. Brown redish color. Light sweetness. Malt caramel and alcohol aroma. Thick head and texture.
"
1," From bottle, into my Chimay Chalice. Dark brown, very little light passes through, with a big fluffy head. Aroma is startling with dark fruits and yeast. Taste is rich with noticeable alcohol. Wish I could afford to drink this every day.
"
1," I like this. Its big, dry and grating. Definitely my favorite here tonight.
"
1," 12oz bottle via trade.  Very dark brown in color with a one-finger whiteh head that lasts and leaves some lacing.  The aroma is pretty nice, with HUGE bourbon, backed up by ashy roast and coffee.  The flavor is all right, but WAY too big on bourbon.  That dominates the flavor, and a dry and ashy espressoish stout hides behind it.  Medium-bodied with a rather dry mouthfeel, and a bit boozy for 6%, from all the bourbon I guess.  Overall, a bit unbalanced.  If they were able to fine-tune the -bal aging though, I could see this being pretty good.
"
1," Strong floral aroma with plenty of hops... dark copper colored ale pours with a thick white head... tastes refreshing with plenty of hops ... very smooth texture that lingers in the mouth...
"
1," Cask (GBBF 2008) - Copper brown in colour. Fruity and hoppy taste with raisins and grapefruit. Fairly rich and smooth with a bit of an alcoholic kick in the finish. Like a cross between a barley wine and an IPA in some ways. Interesting.
"
1," 12 oz bottle		Hiding in a mixed six pack in the cellar I pulled this out on a whim. The result was very disappointing given my expectations and the fact that it was aged on bourbon barrels. Honestly this beer would have been better if it had been released without any extra aging. Fortunately I only had the one bottle so I am not stuck with five more.		Aroma / Appearance - The thin feeble head was timid as if ashamed to be associated with the beer beneath. The color of weathered teak at least it did a good job of complementing the base which was on that thin line between deep brown and black. Cheap Hersheys chocolate coupled with a diet cherry soft drink and a scoop of vanilla ice cream give this a cheap feel. The oak is there but not with enough force to break through more than infrequently.		Flavor / Palate - Strong notes of roasted coffee kickstart the senses. The taste profile is otherwise on par with the aroma including an afterthought of bitter oak. The creamy mouthfeel is nice but when the heaviness continues into the finish it detracts from the rest of the experience. This is basically a one trick pony - dont be fooled by the label or the additional aging. I am sure Barley Island can do better though.

1," 750ml. Beautifully well rounded. The flavor, the body, the carbination, the aftertaste and the aroma rely on eachother to create a very well rounded, unique and unforgettable beer. The aftertaste reminds me of taking a deep breath of fresh, cold mountain air. A very good product all around.
"
1," overall very good. Small hint of alcohol aftertaste. Best flavor as beer warms towards bottom of glass.
"
1," The aroma was malty and a little yeasty with a bit of a staleness in the background. Caramel and citrus were notable but lurking behind. The beer arrived crystal clear amber golden with a low white head which was tight bubbled and lasted to lace the glass. The flavor was nicely malty and citrusy with orange and grapefruit coupled to caramel. The beer was well balanced with a nice bittering aspect which lasted long into the dry finish. The aftertaste was citrusy and pleasant. The body was medium with a moderate level of carbonation and a creamy texture on the palate. The aroma was a bit odd, but the flavor was great. Served a bit too cold, but a nice brew.	Nip glass (8 oz) at Quigleys.
"
1," FEB 26, 2011 12 oz. Darkish copper with a humongous head even with a soft pour. Nose is big caramel, resin, and citrus. Flavor is caramel, resin, wood and orange baby aspirin. Light-medium body is smooth and watery. Another two-note blast of West Coast hops. Nothing new, and nearly well-done.
"
1," Corked bottle is cool (could they get $7 abottle if it had a twist off?) Pours like a promise. All sorts of storied aromas call out to the nose like feast fit for a king. Smokey notes, apricots, and chocolates. The sediment rocks!
"
1," Bottle @ Metro. Clear, dark brown pour with a small white head, decent retention. Aroma is yeast, roast malts, and floral. Taste is extremely full bodied, not for the faint of heart, but extremely smooth finish and a lingering taste of sweet malt. Superb.
"
1," Larger bottle (750?).  Pours a deep amber color with a medium off white head with good lacing.  The aroma is yeast, fruit, vinous, caramel malt.  The flavor has more yeast, vinous, moderately sweet caramel like malt, and other fruits.  Dry, somewhat  fruity finish.  This is decent enough, but probably wont revisit anytime soon.
"
1," Tasted on 07-05-07 at 65 F in my trappist glass. Pours a nice opaque ruby brown with a 1 finger off white head that fades quickly. Light hops, malt, a hint of grapes, cherry, and a bit of oakiness to the nose. Taste is of cherry, grapes, and oak. Aftertaste of malt, dry yeast, wheat, and buble gum. A watery-medium body with a bit of a fizzy feel. This basically feels like a watered down version of Chimay Blue. Its alright, but not something I would search for.
"
1," Bottle.	Clear golden coloured with a small white head.	Sweet aroma of malts, grain and hay.	Sweet flavour of malts, hay and hops with grainy notes.	Hoppy finish.
"
1," Clear dark red colour, big white head. Fruity aromas. Sweet and fruity tastes as well. All in all, a nice, affordable beer.
"
1," JAN 16, 2007 On tap at the Chattanooga location. Light pale golden appearance, little to no head; bit of a wet paper bag aroma. Has a tad bit of a sweet honey flavor to it, otherwise typical lager flavor. About par for a brewpub light - brewed for the masses. Earlier Rating"
1," Bottle at Papss - Thanks. Cloudy golden - white head. Banana, berries, wheaty, sharpness, orange, yeasty,citrus, fruity, caramel, light acid. v.
"
1," At first whiff, dry and woody, but subsequent pulls reveal more sweetness and hints of considerable alcohol. Very dark reddish brown body with plenty of large, floating sediment. Color is very similar to the ""red"" color of the label, so close in fact that it must have been made that way purposefully. Average-sized to large, off-white head that is slow to dissipate. Not much lace. Initial mouthfeel tastes identically to the aroma. After a couple of sips I detected a delecatable buttery component. Wonderfully pleasant and balanced; my initial impression that this brew was pedestrian proved wrong; it is really nice. Not as carbonated a mouthfeel as a lot of Belgians. Nectar. This would be a great beer to replace the customary bottle of wine as a gift when attending a party.
"
1," 341 ml bottle from The Beer Store (part of Winter Mixer). Pours a clear dark orange with small white head.  Aroma is definitely mandarin orange slightly sweet, but with a little peel-like sourness as well as some cereal grains.  Taste is semi-sweet mandarin orange-like flavour not so sweet as to be classic soda pop-ish (the Orangina comment is bang on) with some grainy malt.  Fine, but strong carbonation.  Not great, but probably my favourite of the mixer in that it was at least a little different.  I have to say though if the Winter Mixer has a mandarin orange beer, a lime beer and a pale lager, what does the Summer Mixer have?
"
1, Fass 	Noten
1," 750 corked n caged bottle 2010 vintage- The cork popped out like a champagne cork, massively pressurized- Pours cloudy dark orange with a suprisingly thin head and poor lacework. The aroma makes up for the appearance, its Belgian sugar, yeast, banana, and tart. The flavor is also sugar, not too tart, figs, banana, clove, smooth and sessionable. The body is full to medium, carbonation is high. Overall I was kind of let down, there is no denying this is a world class beer, but I have to admit I had higher expectations.
"
1," On tap at the brewpub. Dark for the style - hazy caramel color, thin ring for a head. Weak nose, anise, caramel, some nutty notes. Seems under-hopped for an IPA. Light citrus flavors, some anise notes. Strange, but enjoyable.
"
1," Color is the dull red-brown of autumn oak leaves. Small but insistent ecru head. Promising aromas of candi sugar, spice (nutmeg/clove/anise), candied fruits, chocolate-covered raisins. Flavor is complex, but eludes an accurate description; the closest I can get is amber malts, dark rye bread, almost-chocolate, fig, mineral water, and a very light acidity. Some (noble?) hop bitterness rears its head and then fades away in the effervescent, fluffy mouthfeel. Finishes dry with an aftertaste that is vaguely chocolate, lightly peppery and nutmeggy, cocoa powder, and... fresh parsley? Tastier than blue or white label, in my opinion. I could imagine pairing this with turkey or pulled porked, with mole sauce.
"
1," From a plastic barrel at Reading Beer Festival, day 2, on 1 May 2009. Labelled as Oakwood Medium Perry but I guess this is the same stuff. Pale orange pulpy colour. Sweetish and slightly rubbery. Otherwise juicy and fruity. Pleasant drinking, if not very challenging.
"
1," Dark brown with a 1 finger head that dissapates in 5 minutes to a light glaze.  Zig zagged lace along the entire glass.  Raisin, smoked wood, fruity smell that has so much going on in this beer.  Just like the description; it tastes like it smells.  Raisins, smoked wood, herbs and spices.  It is very complex and smooth.  Feels just right as it hits the tongue and all the way to the finish.  This beer is a perfect example of why I love Trappists.  Outstanding!
"
1," The Zwickel is definitely this breweries best beer that is made on a regular basis.  A bit of hop flavor comes through that I have not been able to detect as much in their other beers.  There is not nearly as much diacetyl as the other beers, which really helps the overall flavor.  The diacetyl in fact is barely perceptible (I may even be imagining that I can taste it).  This beer has a slight haze to it and to my mouth is quite a bit rounder tasting than the corresponding pils.
"
1," Bottle 33cl. @ home.Clear light yellow orange color with a small to average, frothy - fizzy, fair lacing, fully diminishing, white head. Aroma is light to moderate malty, grain, toasted, sweet malt, perfume - spicy. Flavor is moderate sweet and light light bitter with a average duration. Body is light to medium, texture is watery, carbonation is soft. [20081117]
"
1," Bottle - Pours dark copper with an off white head. Smells yeasty with some light spice (cloves, nutmeg) and a nice, subtly sweet breadiness. The taste is lightly spiced bread, a touch of honey sweetness, and a dry, yeasty finish. Smooth, balanced, and wonderful, this is my favorite between Chimay White and Blue. I find the other two to be too bitter and sharp, but this is pure silk.
"
1," So mistaknly rated this thinking it was the Irish Red. Guess I should have paid more attention. Ooops. Well I cant figure out how to delete a rating....so Ill just give it the average.
"
1," Chimay (bleu) grand reserve smells of fruit ( plums, black cherries and raspberries) and spices ( clove and cinnamon). The head is tan and fades without leaving much lacing. The taste is rich, plummy, and wine-like. I detected no obvious presence of either hops or malt. This beer is less sweet than Chimay red. The 9% alcohol content is not  readily detectable in the flavor,  but is nonetheless felt as one slowly drains the bottle. This is definitely one to nurture and savor. I enjoyed it with aged cheese.
"
1," Bottle. Poured a murky copper with a tan head. Has a hop and fruity aroma. Has a mild roasty taste, with a hop finish.

"
1," This is a VERY well made beer. I need to try it again because I was so caught off gaurd that I paid 9.50 for one 11.2oz bottle at the beer. Definitely a QUALITY beer.
"
1," Pours brownish red with a bigh tan head.  Heavy bourbon aroma and lots of malt.  Heavily carbonated (too much so for this style).  Some bitter chocolate in flavor, but also has a slight medicinal taste as well.  Kind of thin on palate, but may be because overcarbonated and may be old.
"
1," Swing top bottle. Golden color. Soft grassy aroma with hints of malt. Grassy, beady, soft hopbitter flavor. Thinnish, with a soft but persistant grassy finish.

1," Thanks to Todd ( antzman ) from The KEG Liquors. Pours pretty much black with a small light tan head. Aroma is roasty, nutts, malts, light smoke. Flavor is very full for a low acl % stout. Bitter nutty malts and light smoke. Body is on the thin side but was still full of flavor.

1," I loved this beer.  Just got one in the new bottles.  Its actually called Beastie Barrel Stout but its right up there with Expedition for me.  Obviously different ..but one of my favorite stouts Ive ever had.  An absolute must try...amazing!!!

"
1,"  Complex yet subdued.  Wine-like aroma, with a bready taste.
"
1," Malty beer. I detected liquorice, chocolate and hops in the intense taste. Well hidden alcohol. Long bitter finish. Bottled in 2001, but the beer will develop for many years. In the 1999 bottled version is the alcohol even less prominent and a porto taste has further developed.
"
1," From the corked bottle... Pours a rich, creamy brown with a medium-sized light tan head with adequate retention.  Very pleasant to the nose with a refreshing flowery aroma that comes along with a fresh scent of yeast.  The taste is spot on.  Just enough spice and a dry finish that is just bitter enough.  One of the best there is.
"
1," GABF 2010.  Pours clear amber with a small, frothy cream colored head, low retention with light lacing.  Aroma is average malt (caramel, toasted), heavy hops (floral, pine, citrus), and light esters (apple) with notes of alcohol.  Flavor is average malt (caramel, toasted, meal), heavy hops (floral, pine, citrus), and light esters (apple/pear) with notes of peach.  Medium body, carbonation, and creaminess, low warmth with a dry finish.

"
1," Young bottle 9/01	A beautiful cloudy copper/red/brown. Moderate white, rocky, persistent collar. When I first uncorked, foam exploded! Not sure why. Was sitting stationary for a long time. Yeasty, fruity nose. Soft body, starts out yeasty, then a mellow maltiness takes over, smooth fruitness and an earthy character finishes it up, nice alcohol presence..subtle spicyness, slightly acidic, a great beer.  Has that divine chimay house flavor....recommended. The blue is still the champ though.
"
1," Draft @ GTMW.  Pours a jet black with a thin tan head.  Excellent lacing on the glass.  The aroma is of roasted malts, and strong coffee.  The flavor is great.  An excellent stout, with a robust coffee flavor that blends well with the creaminess of the oatmeal stout.  Very well done.

1," Bottle labelled 1999, from Metro Wines, Syston, Leicester. Very dark, probably black beer, with a shallow but firm creamy head. Strong grape and choc aroma. Smooth flavour with only a smidgeon of noticeable strength on the finish. Remarkably little flavour for such a strong beer - fairly watery with some smooth choc. Not outstanding, but does improve as you drink it. Would be very poor if served too cold - beware!

1," Pours (suprise) that usual red color of a dubbel.  Head is thin and lacing is minimal.  Aroma is dried fruit and slight wood.  Flavor is large and malty, very little hop presence, dark fruits, a little veggie, a dry spell with a slight alcochol note, with a mild bitter finish.  Mouthfeel is much better than in the blue, thank God.

1," 8/12 0.33 l bottle at Hopdevil. Poured bit murky, dark reddish brown body with medium reddish head. Aroma is very nice, caramel with dark fruits, quite yeasty and kind of specific from Trappist beers with sourish character. Flavor is almost as good, following the aroma, being somehow bittersweet now. Could have been a bit fuller regarding body. Nice long sweet fruity finish.  Delicious, simply the best dubbel Ive ever had.

1," In my mind Chimay is theepitomy of Trappists.  Deep copper in color with a porous, white head. Somewhat spicy on the nose with hints of fruit. Tangy/spicy on the palate, yet extremely elegant.

1," This is a palate destroyer, so make sure you rinses thoroughly after trying this one. Pours a dark brown body with a semi watery body. medium sized head with a pleasent lightly roasted coffee aroma. Mouthfeel is semi dry but also very light.

1," APR 24, 2007 Draft at the Seven Bridges Brewpub in Jacksonville.  Served in a dimpled pint mug on the evening of their their party to introduce this seasonal arrival for the year (11/30/2006).  As is their custom lately, the price was low and proceeds benefited the USO..  kudos for the effort!  Clear dark brown beer with a fizzy white head that soon disappeared.   Aromas of mild chocolate and malt.  Flavor was cold coffee up front and dark malt in the background.  Only a faint roasty bitterness.  Had an acidic sharpness,  and a little thin and watery throughout.  Average to decent flavor, and an OK drink.  Its nice for a change of pace, but its not impressive and if you are a stout drinker its not something you will want to drink for the whole night.

1," Swing top bottle from  MoritzF. Thanks. Malty, slightly caramelly aroma. Caramel flavor with some nutty and herbal bitterness. Malty, bready, medium bodied and well made dunkel.

"
1," prunes, dates, figs, and raisins. A dash more candied sugar and I move right into a vineyard of black grapes and fine ruby Porto. More brown sugar sprinkles and visions of Christmas cake, hold the sugarplums, bring me to canned black cherries. Oh yes, heaven is here once more and all is right in my world. As much as I could smell my Chimay all day long, there be drinking to be done. Some will pooh-pooh the effervescence brought on by bottle-conditioning, but Blue is a rich sweet heavy brew whose playful effervescence serves the very important task of cleansing your palate for a continually pleasurable quaffing session without being overpowered by cloying sweetness. Molasses and spice mingle with nutmeg while my tastebuds take in the fruit-felt bounty of raisins, prunes, black cherries (fresh and canned), and grapes before ending in licorice. There is a pervasive candied sugar sweetness which isnt overpowering thanks in part to her effervescent body. Her palate centers all immediate pleasures on the top of my tongue, though as we further our temptuous relationship, the back of my tongue and throat dries with spice and wood. For a brief moment, I have flashes of tropical paradise in the form of candied pineapple, and then she is gone. As my Blue warms, her flavors continue to melt into, with, and around each other in practiced Belgian Trappist artistry. As ruby Porto warms my body and soul, I find my Chimay chalice empty. Thats okay though; I still have the other half of my 750ml bottle to savor further.			I can definitely taste how with more age the Chimay Grande Reserve (Blue) would grow drier and develop richer ruby Porto notes. The potential was already there and growing with just a little over a year in the bottle. A beer to enjoy fresh and laid down, never buy just one.

1," This bottled brew poured a small head of fine to large sized brown colored mostly lasting bubbles that left behind a good lacing.  The head was notably weird in that it had large sized bubbles on the left side of my mug and finely sized bubbles on the right hand side!  The body was opaque with no visible carbonation and light black in color.  The aroma was very nice with malt molasses and brown beer notes and a mildly vinous coffee scent.  The mouth feel was initially very thick with malty and mild coffee notes and a lingering mild coffee malt bite in the finish.  The flavor was thick with malt and coffee notes.
"
1," Wow, take that Budwieser, Ive discovered the real king of beer!  Been wanting to try this for a while... wish granted.  Nose is nutty rosted malt with a light floral/fruity scent.  Fantastic looking beer with a coppery brown hue posessing a nice toasted marshmallow head.  The mouthfeel on this beer is fantasticly perfect.  The flavor profile is as complex as I had hoped.  The yeast imparts the floral/fruity hints to a slightly nutty profile with a full roundhouse kick of malt.  Theres enough hops present to keep the beer balanced, but I couldnt really detect anything the hops may have added to the flavor profile.  Overall this is a fantastic beer.  Something to be drank daily if youre the son of a wealthy Texas oil man, but for a simple man like me, its a fantastic treat to be savored when I can ""treat"" myself.  Im a HUGE fan of pairing beer with food, this beer would seem to be great with alot of fare depending on what youre trying to accomplish; suggestions would be Dim Sum, well spiced seafood dishes, and something as rustic as an openfaced sandwich or stew.
"
1," Unlike the commercial description, i found the red to have a light, quickly dissipating head.  The aroma was rich and inviting.  The taste was slightly bitter, but very smooth and full.  I was able to taste the fruit, and was left with an overall pleasing, and clean taste.
"
1," a thick head with good carbonation.  a slightly bitter aftertaste, but still very pleasant.
"
1," NOV 22, 2010 750 ML bottle in Germany. Golden orange hazy colour. Medium beige head. Good lacing. Aroma of sweet ripe fruits, malt and alcohol. Very good mouthfeel. The flavour has a pleasant fruity sweetness with yeast, some wood, malt and a nice mild bitterness. This is a great Triple, and its from Germany which is very rare.
"
1," This is a good brew for sure, but its just not mind blowing. It just seems standard when compared to other Belgians. It pours a nice and cloudy copper color with a beautiful head. If you have had the blue then you have pretty much had this one, except this one is slightly less complex. With a huge abundance of better Belgians out there, I really dont see myself picking this one up very often. Still worth a try though!
"
1," I just opened a 750 ml bottle (2-2002 vintage) and I'm sampling it from a tulip glass. It pours a thick, tan head, and has a definite yeast aroma, with the beer itself being an opaque dark orange-brown. There's a complex grain flavor to the beer, with a bunch of yeast and other overtones. All in all, a very sophisticated and enjoyable Trappist ale, one I find superior to the Chimay Red by far.
"
1," Earthy. Malty. Good. A standard/great high quality Beligain Strong Ale. Not the best, but the most accessible of those available. Still a fantastic brew. Pick em up, drink em or store em. Good stuff!
"
1," Its all been said.  I very glad I tried it.
"
1," Bottle. Pours a clear amber with a reddish tint and a white head that lasted for a bit. Aroma is malty for the most part, has a bit of a musty wood note. Flavor is hoppy with a combination of citrus and wet pine notes.
"
1," Clear golden with a fizzy white head. Grain and vanilla aroma and taste with citrus notes to the finish.
"
1," Dark hazels brown with a half inch of a nosily bubbly head, lots of small chunks float everywhere, very tasty looking beer. Sharp yeast, smooth banana, a touch of alcohol, and cherries fill the nose, beer smells better and better when beer warms to proper temperature. Banana, and sweet malts comprise most of the flavor, there seems to be a slight smoky aspect to it as well, the flavor is very good but seems slightly watered down. Its strange this isnt getting the lowest marks of all the Chimmays I have drank but its my least favorite, it is the most mild tasting but still dam good.""
"
1," Bottle from the LCBO. I cant believe that I havent gotten around to rating any of the Chimays yet! Heres where I start to rectify that. It pours a slightly murky reddish-brown with a small tan head. Aroma of dark malt, icing sugar, caramel and spice (notably clove, and something else I cant quite place). Body is lighter than I recall - this bottle has been aging for a couple of years in admittedly less than optimal conditions, so perhaps that had an effect? Flavour is quite restrained, but also complex - dark fruit, barley candy, licorice & herbs. Lovely stuff indeed, and much too easy to drink for a 9%er!
"
1, Pours a cloudy copper color with a nice foamy head. Pretty good retention with some spotty lace.		S
1," Poured from the bottle, ruby red with a frothy head that subsided quickly. An alcoholic cherry aroma. Alcohol and fruit again in the flavour, combined with a carbonated mouth feel and a strong tangy and sour finish.
"
1," 2003. Sweet & malty in aroma. Some hoppy sourness and floral tones. Dark cloudy root beer brown with off-white foamy lacing head. Body is medium watery with vibrant carbonation. Deep, rich malty taste. Carbonic bite. Alcohol, plum, chalky yeast with dry finish and light bitter nutty after. A slight weizenbock character to it.
"
1," Tap @ GTMW 2006.  Lovely, hazed and muddy golden orange in color with a creamy white sheaf and clinging wrung.  Sweet and bitter orange peels abate the nose, along with cloves, banana, orange zest, lemon seeds and buttery vanilla.  Sugary refreshment hits the tongue and reveals a touch of fusel burn and a hopped up anthem.  Effervescence meets husks and coriander thats been dashed far too liberally.  Orangey stream teams with green buds and dry bitterness.  Medium-bodied with curtailing pils malt and a lemon juice flavor shine on grapefruit rind shavings.  Harsh bitterness is never dormant, and quite dominant especially in the end, meeting up with bitter orange peel for the last goodbye.
"
1," Poured a frothy, whitish head that dissipated, and left a thin rind.  Beautiful deep ebony, but lots of suspended sediment, that detracted greatly.  Lack of yeasty nose, in fact little nose at all.  Sharp bite up front that stings, but softens on the palate and lingers wonderfully.  Biscuits and figs with a bit of caramel. I think this wasnt the greatest bottle, may have been poorly handled, or old.  Still a classic.  I believe previous bottles have had more yeastiness.  Id love to have this on tap.
"
1," bottle, indeed less complex than the chimay blue, also not as long a finish. But a very nice beer nonetheless, and even might be easier to drink than the blue one.
"
1," Fredagsbaren p Biologi, Aarhus	Bottled	Den Tatoverede Enke, Kbenhavn	On tap	Complex - fruity and flower hops	Nice bitterness
"
1," On tap at Disneys Boardwalk. Reddish brown pour. Nutty malty chocolate malt aroma. Thick malty taste with a touch of hops. Very much done in an english style and very subdued, but underwhelming.
"
1," Bottle. Huge thanks to Yespr for bying this for us at Tivoli christmas market 2009, finally we got to it. Dark warm yellow wonderfull colour. Moderate nice apple aroma. Vinius. Almost close to nice whitewine. Powerfull intense apple flavor. Long fantastic finish. medium dry, with a nice suttle sweetness. Creamy palate. Very expensive but a great experience.
"
1," Cellared for two years. Brown color with a ruby shine. Thick tan head. Very complex aroma of dark fruits, toffee and vanilla. Wonderfull flavor of dark fruits and toffee, maybe vanilla. Medium body, creamy mouthfeel, the carbonation was lively at first but after a while it became softer. Great beer, a ""must have"" in a cellar !
"
1," Pours a deep gold body with a disappointingly small, quickly diminishing, white head.		Smell"
1," very good fruity flavor but it has to be drank ice cold or the alcohol is to strong	Looks great and smells great.	The bottle has to be litely shaken before drinking or youl get a mouth full of yeast.
"
1," solidly roasty, sharp, and well defined. Some ashtray notes and slightly sour cream ar noted as well. The mouthfeel is slightly prickly and of pretty average density. The coffee carries over well into the flavor, distinct, genuine, and sharp. There is a faint creamy sweetness and a touch of mocha and something just a bit sour in the finish. I really enjoy drinking this beer. I cant say its the best coffe stout Ive ever had, but I can drink a lot of these and have no qualms with it.
"
1," Poured a strong red/brown with a nice head. Aroma was yeasty and spicy. Flavor was rich. Full of spice fruit and honey flavors. Alcohol was mildly noticeable at the end.
"
1," You can tell that its bottle conditioned from the head (very bubbly and disapates quickly).  Bouquet has the characteristic Belgian beer smell; very gentle flowery/fruity smell, with a punch of a smell that is acrid.  One writer calls out ""caramels"" and at the suggestion its hard not to notice.  Color is a nice a warm brown nutty color, but the beer being unpasteurized/unfiltered and bottle conditioned is pretty cloudy.  It is very drinkable and smooth, flavor is understated and not all that memorable.  The high alcohol content goes right to your head ;)  Definitely a top-notch beer, but not my favorite
"
1," Has a pretty nice oatmeal and chocolate aroma.  Nice black color with a little brown head.  Has a coffee flavor, slightly bitter, although it seems a little off somehow.  Nice body and carbonation.    Overall, its OK, but nothing I would seek out in the future.
"
1," Bottle. Blindtasting @ Thewolf. Cloudy orange with a small creamy head. Sweet malty nose. Caramel, toffee, roast, vinous, smooth. Nice.
"
1," This is a keller/land/Zwickel style. A classic kellerbier easy and nice to drink. Quite malty.
"
1," SEP 29, 2008 Jeckyl and Hyde, Yin and Yang, Good and Bad.  This was that beer.  While it carried with it a really inticing aroma of chocolate covered espresso beans,  treacle, and toffee, the flavor really was a let down.  It had a nice coffee/dark chocolate beginning and then, bam...nothing.  It just dropped off the palate in an instant and what was left reminded me of drinking a seltzer water.  A nice black hue, medium bodied with a one-finger thick tan head.  I think if the beer had more depth of flavor, it would score much higher with me.  Decent beer, but could have been much, much better.
"
1," Cloudy dark red appearance.  Nose is fruity with hints of sweet malt and light chocolate.  Body is smooth and chocolatey with a touch of light hops towards the end and a good roast building.  Very nice beer, huge ABV that doesn't distract.
"
1," 11.2 oz. bottle from Kellers IGA.  Pours a cloudy plum-red-amber with visible yeast sediment.  Aroma of Belgian yeast, spices, banana, apricot, candi sugar, caramel malts, dust, nuts, and a hint of alcohol.  Flavor of Belgian yeast, nuts, spices, mixed fruits, pepper, caramel malts, and candi sugar.  Medium-bodied, smooth, with moderate carbonation and a dry yeasty finish.  Tried in red-white-blue order with the other two main Chimay beers, this was right up there with the other two.
"
1," Tastes a little like Westvleteren 12 only not quite as complex.
"
1," Pours dark red amber.  The aroma is fresh and earthy yeasty and amazing with spicey undertones. Very bready and heavy great paired with cheese and apples.  Rich with a toffee and choclate almost like hint.  Amazing.!!
"
1," Bottle. Small white head, fair lacing, carbonated, Malty, sweet, citrusy, banana, orange, and some spicy notes. Flavor was sweet, tart, spicy, malty, and somewhat dry. Smooth and somewhat dry mouthfeel. Very drinkable IMO. Worth a try!
"
1," Pours a deep golden almost orange with a good head and some lace. The aroma is hay and noble hops with a mild biscut character. The flavor is very crisp with a nice hoppy bitterness and some grassy mild earthiiness. One of the best pale lagers Ive had.
"
1, Poured from bottle into Snifter.		Appearance
1," bottle, bought at the former brewerys Getrnkemarkt. Clear pale yellow colour with a decent white head, hoppy-grainy nose. Medium-bodied with a shy malty background and some nice herbal hops, which are rather fragrant and aromatic at first, fading out on the way to the lingering finish. I would have loved to try the original version brewed in Ergenzingen, but, unfortunately I was a few years too late.
"
1," 03 magnum thanks to biggreen opened at the Houston BA Tasting.  Pours a brown with a nice tan head.  Nose is of raisins and malt.  Taste is of raisins, malt and some spice.  Mouthfeel is medium with carbonation and some alcohol.  Very nice.
"
1," Bottled. (BB 051028) Clear, golden with a minimal white head. Sweet and malty aroma with alcohol and some sour notes. The flavor is malty and sweet, with some sourness and alcohol. Full-bodied with a cloying sweetness. A very sweet finish with a long bitterness and alcohol-notes. Nice, but one bottle is too much. (060928)
"
1," Tasted 8/11/10. Sampler from the Brewpub. Pours filtered with a dark golden hue. Layer of white head. Aromas of bright citrus hops. Medium bodied with a crisp and flavorful body. Well done! Typical flavors of grapefruit and citrus. Good lacing head. Solid grapefruit bitterness from mid-palate into the finsih. Nice and nicely done!
"
1," This was a beer i always wanted to try and was not to sure about but now i tried it and it was great with a dark pour and all kind of flavors very tasty and will try more.CHEERS!
"
1," Refigerated bottle poured into a trappist glass.  Pours medium brown with nice off-white head.  Head goes away fairly quickly for a trappist beer.  Taste is dark fruit and has medium carbonation.  Not the best double I have had, but good.
"
1," Beautiful color and flavor... carmel and plum.  Hurts the old pocket book though otherwise would drink it regularly.  One of my favorites so far.
"
1," Draught.  Poured black with medium beige head.  Much lacing.  Not much aroma, a bit of coffee and a bit of malt.  Full bodied flavour, roast malt and coffee.  Lasting finish balance of hop and roast.
"
1," Draft sampler at BRB. Dark amber with a moderate white head that diminished slowly. Moderate balanced aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture. Moderate balanced hoppy sweet flavor with a medium finish.
"
1," 750 ml bottle from LCBO.  Pours a very cloudy, dark, brownish orange with large off-white head.  Nice big aroma of yeast, sweet fruit (banana, pear), and light spiciness.  Strong taste with lots of fruit notes, both light (banana, pear) and dark (raisin) and a pleasant spiciness.  Body is fairly medium.   Nice beer.
"
1," Medium brownish-red color, lots of carbonation, but head fizzled out quickly with no lace. Smells of ALCOHOL and nuts. Malty and nutty, and even at just 7% ABV, there was obviously no attempt to hide the alcohol, which after a while, became overwhelming. Watery palate and too flat for me.
"
1," Pours dark copper with off white head. Aromas of bread, dough and dark fruits. Flavor is slightly sweet with lots of Belgian yeast and caramel, brown sugar. Medium body with lively carbonation and a slick mouthfeel. A very good abbey dubbel.
"
1," Dark brown with red edges and a nice dark milk chocolate colored loose foam.  Aroma is very nice, molasses, burnt sugar, coffee, loads of bitter chocolate, faint oak and red wine, holy shit this is lovely.  The taste is different but still fantastic, the red wine is more forward, light oaky dryness, and finishes with sugar, and a light roast.  I must get more beers aged in red wine barrels.
"
1," Market Porter, Southwark. Golden lager appearance. Cidery nose. Soft caramel. Herbal. Cider finish. Very pleasant.
"
1," 12 oz bottle, via Sephiroth.  Pours a clear flat black body under a foamy one finger plus brown head.  A good amount of visible carbonation and lots of lacing.  The aroma is full of dark roasted coffee, black patent malt, and roast.  The flavor is a little too heavy on the burnt malt, lending an ashy chalkiness that overpowers the coffee and roast notes.  The coffee does come out nicely on the finish.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, watery in texture, but not thin, with moderate soft fizzy carbonation.  This was OK, but not up there with my favorite coffee beers.  A far cry from Bells Java.
"
1," had one of the big corked bottles ... i loved it ... might swith my preferred style to belgian strong ... wasnt as sweet as some of the other's ive had which was too my liking ... felt and tasted as dark as it poured
"
1," Simply excellent to drink.  I love this beer due to its drinkability as well as its pedigry and lineage.  It is more affordable and lighter than the Blue and as such offers better value for the serious drinker.  I still prefer the Blue as an ale to sit back and enjoy, but this is a really enjoyable, easy to drink, trappist ale with an interesing history.  Very nice.
"
1," Bottle from Acknud. Thank you sir. Pours a golden amber body with a smallish, off white head that quickly fades to a ring of foam. Spotty drip lacing. Nose of sweet malts, toasted grains, muted spice, hops, vegetal and floral notes. Not nearly hoppy enough on the nose for an APA. Flavor is more of the same, malt and grain sweetness dominating, with the hops cowering in the background. Light bodied, low carbonation. Watery palate. Finish is short, watery and bland. I hope this wasnt fresh, because it was pretty bad.
"
1," Bottle from La Mesa Market. Dark golden in color on the pour. Very grainy aroma. Very grainy flavored. Some maltiness as well. Not all that bad.
"
1," 750 ml. big 'ole brown corked & caged Belgian bottle. Bottling date of 1/02/03. January 2, 2003 was a good day for bottling Chimay, because mine is wonderful. Poured out a hazy, rusty orange color.	The cork shot out of the bottle first. Very effervescent, highly carbonated. Huge head at first, mocha cream in color. Slowly slid back to a thick matting, and even more lacing down my Chimay chalice. Huge island of yeast floated in the middle of the beer.	Aromas are of caramel malts, lactic wheat tang, fresh cut hay, slight earthy & slightly musty aromas as well. I could go on describing this beer all day, because it is so complex, and so well made. Only 1 point off for cloudiness. Other than that, it was perfect. Tastes the same as it smells. Slight lactic wheat tang, enormous malty backbone supports the hops very well. Noble hops make an all too brief appearance towards the end. Bready, yeasty bite, and smooth mouthfeel make for a great beer.	I wish I lived down the road from this Abbey.
"
1," Pours a very nice copper color with nice head. A fruity, spicy aroma. Sweet taste with nice fruit compliments. Very nice dubbel.
"
1," Bottle. Slightly hazy golden with small white head. Flavour is malt, sweet and hops.
"
1," APR 19, 2007 2001 Vintage"
1," Served the first glass at the broad ripple location in a goblet.  The appearance is very deep/muddy brown. Think  murky muddy waters. Much more brown than black but clearly darker than an IPA with alot of ""stuff"" going on in it and NO opacity to be found. Slight fading white head that leaves decent lacing. The initial aroma is mostly sweet citrus hops with faint sugar. The flavor is very smooth and sweet. Citrus and juicy fruit hops come through as well as dark malt and chocolate. The smoothness adds a nice milk chocolate accent that rounds this out nicely. The finish stays sweet and reminds me of a hopped up orange creamsicle with an alcohol punch. By far the most impressive offering Ive had at B.I. to date. Get it while you can!
"
1," 31.08.2008, 0,33l Bottle. The beer is lively carbonated. The colour is redish brown. Aroma is well balanced. Very nice.
"
1," Draft sampler at BRB. Dark amber color with a moderate white head taht diminished quickly. Moderate hop aroma. Medium body with smooth texture. Moderate flavor with medium bitter finish.
"
1," April 2004. Deep red copper lager with a sweet caramel aroma, and butterscotch. Watered down caramle and boiled corn in mouth. Still good malt character , and if it is was fresher, would make a great Eastern europe dark beer.
"
1," Tap @ Big River Chattanooga.  Clear amber color with a thin off-white head.  Sweet toffee flavor and aroma.  Light finish not a whole lot going on here.  Lightly bitter finish and semi-dry.
"
1," Bottled.  Pound to a penny I bought this from the same place as hughie.  He could have written my words for me.  Infected for sure.  Vinegary, and I like the aspirin analogy.  Mine is probably less muddy but certainly not nice to drink.  Couldnt finish it.
"
1," MAR 19, 2004 (Pizza Port Belgian Beer Party in Carlsbad, CA) Sweet like a tripel, but much more malty; Mildly bitter; Sweet, spicy finish; Cloudy and medium brown in color; Spicy nose; Off white head has good retention, eventually fading to a sheen, and lacing is present but minimal
"
1," This was a strong beer, but the complex flavour compared to most beers makes it quite unique and delicious.
"
1," Thin wheat ale.  Pale yellow with a small white head.  Aroma of wheat and lemongrass.  Taste is crisp enough but has no real body.
"
1," Has a appearance of a mix of a dark cider and caramel.  The head dies quickly to about 2-3 mm and then lingers on to the end.  Smells like a mix of spices and apples.  The taste pretty much resembles the smell; a sense of spice mixed with a fruity and slightly sweet flavor.  The flavors stand out more after sitting, so dont drink this right out of the fridge.  It has just the right thickness and carbonation, not feeling too thin, and the bubbles tingle when you first drink it.  No lingering bitterness to it either.  Overall, one of my favorites.
"
1," Pours out a nice reddish color with a large fluffy white head. It has a good fruity aroma with a good amount of carbonation. It is a very smooth brew with nice sweet fruity/malty taste with a slight alcohol/hop finish.
"
1," Dark brown pour with a beige head.  Aroma of lightly roasted coffee and semisweet chocolate.  Flavor is nutty with notable hints  of roast and bittersweet chocolate
"
1," A wonderful dubbel. Very smooth and full to the palate, with the mixed fruit flavor that Belgians do so well.
"
1," Sweet, nutty and dominated by chocolate malt and molasses.  Velvety palate with a medium finish. Slightly hazy chestnut brown  Medium bittering. Complex and sweet.  Nice fizz.  Quite good.
"
1," one of the best beers ever, due to the yeast in the bottle, the high alchoolic presence, i trying to vintage some bottles...
"
1," Poured with copper body and slight head.  Flavor was sweet and malty, like maple syrup and fruit.  No bitterness.  Some hops could really help this beer out.  Good, but not something I would drink regularly.
"
1," 33 cl bottle. Pours a cloudy medium/dark brown with a moderate, fizzy off-white head that dissipated quickly. Pleasant aroma of sweetgrass, rock candy, and very light roasted malt. The roasted malt is a little stronger in the flavor than in the aroma. Sweetgrass, caramel, and rock candy are present in the flavor as well. A bit of an alcohol burn at the finish, but by no mean excessive. Very solid brew.
"
1," A hazy yellow ale with a thick lacing white head. A pleasant mix of cloves, bananas and catnip. In mouth, a crisp malt with good residual hops, a bit of creamy notes. nice. On tap at brewpub Dec. 30 2008.
"
1," Bottle 330ml, 2008. Hazy copper colour, small light brown head. Fruity aroma, citrus and kiwi in it. Pretty light body, taste has fresh fruits, raisin, hint of nuts; yeast in the finnish.
"
1," 750ml bottle in a Chimay Trappist glass.  Pours brown with a lingering beige head.  Aroma of cereals, caramel, Belgian yeast, and a touch of hops.  Flavor of caramel and yeast on top of the grainy malts, with some underlying hops.  Slightly citrusy on the finish, but mainly the caramel flavor with a little alcohol.  Good carbonation and a full body.  A great beer, but it just doesnt have the drinkability of Rochefort 10 or Duvel.
"
1," From a bottle, this beer smells of cherries and perhaps caramel, with the cherries lasting into the taste along with some serious malt. Not bad.
"
1," Poured with a decent head with some lacing.  Had the color of a dark apple cider.  aroma was only slightly noticable at the temperature i was served it, but opened up as it warmed.  Spices, fruits and some sweetness were detected.  Taste was lighter than I expected.  Sweet with spices and some fruit notes as well.  Rather carbonated, but not to the point of annoyance.  Its definitly somehitng Id like to try again.
"
1," pours a reddish color with a decent fluffy heady aromas of fruit,  belgian style spices and sweetness, taste is of smoothness, carbonation, fruit, and spices a very nice abbey dubbel.
"
1," Rating is somewhat low because I am not a fan of the aroma and the somewhat muddy appearance. Otherwise a classic beer.
"
1," [Bottle] Tawny orange in color with a dense off-white head on top. Nose is of crisp citrus hops and lighter pine notes. Moderately hoppy taste includes orange/grapefruit. Caramel and toasted bready malts provide a reasonable balance in here. Average mouthfeel and palate. Pretty standard.
"
1," Thanks to JK	Dark gold pour	Aroma is golden fruit, spice and light biscuity malt.	very lively carbonation/mouthfeel	Flavour was dry-ish biscuity maltiness, dried apricot, floral bitterness.	Interesting.
"
1," Subtle. Faint sweet aroma. Clear copper-brown, wonderful but fleeting head.	Banana esters, sweet spices (eg cloves), ripe stone fruit (apricot), apple pie. Yeasty, bread and toffee in the mouth. Slight alcohol warming in the finish. Exquisite if unchallenging. I want to drink a lot of these.
"
1," Its dark brown with a huge, creamy head and the aroma has notes of roasted malt, syrup and fruit. The flavour is sweet with notes of syrup, roasted malt, caramel, and the finish is dry with hints of alcohol.
"
1," Large beige long lasting thin head. Dark brown color. Aroma is fruity with dried fruits, spicy and vinous notes. Flavor is initially balanced, turning in the middle into a sweet and fruity (raisins), slightly caramelly taste. Finish is long and fruity. Full bodied.
"
1," Very good all around trappist-ale. Nice pour (in proper glass) with a nice fruit smell and light bubbly head.  Sweet taste, but a little weaker than the blue (the preferred brew).  Overall a nice, light-ish, widely available belgian ale.
"
1," Bottle.  Pours an opaque chestnut color with a nice, fluffy tan head.  Aromas of bread, fruit, and malt.  A bit of an alcoholic burn on the way down with some bitterness.  Medium to heavily bodied.  Overall, a very nice product from those crazy Belgian monks.
"
1," very nice highly carbonated, dark and rich.  a great great beer.  its availabilty only helps it too.  bravo!!!
"
1," The most overrated beer - ever. Granted this beer is good, but its a waste of money unless youre a beer snob. Guinness still beats the ever-living sh*t out of it.
"
1," As clear as it gets, golden hue. Not very complex straight apple, fruit skin nose. Slightly tart, not that sweet at all, very thin..A rather disappointing bottle. Il try again Todd!
"
1," brown/reddish color,nearly no head at all.malty semi sweet aroma with a very faint hop presence.Nice flavor of malt,sweet,mild hoppiness,but the malt is the main player here.Kind of a thin feal to this brew to the point of almost being watery,just a small step above it though.Nice carbonation that i can only figure gives life to this brew that if it where lower would rank even lower then it does.The after taste is malty and semi-sweet,with a light hoppiness thrown in to break up the monoteny.is this a good beer,No but it is definatley a decent brew and well worth trying again.
"
1," Bottle. Light sweet smell, malty brown sugar. A normal white frothy head, which disappeared rather fast. The body is cloudy and dark orange. The taste is light bitter and a little bit sour. The finish is bitter again. The beer is dry and rather soft with a normal carbonation. The finish is a little bit metallic. A normal beer.
"
1," 750ml Bottle. Pours a cloudy brown with a fluffy off-white head. Nuts, oxidized apples, figs and spice in the nose. Full creamy body with fine carbonation. The taste is sweet with yeasty spice, fruit with an overall impression of oxidized apples. Just a bit of bitterness and spice in the finish. Good, but not great.
"
1," 11.2 oz bottle from Costco, 11/21/11			Aroma"
1," 50 cL bottle. Pours cloudy yellow with a lacing white head. Mild cornish and light hoppy aroma. Mild bitter and cornish flavour. Mild biscuit malty base flavour. Bitter finish with a light cornish dry note.
"
1," ottle. Yellow. Lasting thin white foam. Smells like a bag of lime taco chips with the addition of pepper. Compared to other lime beers which are like soda water and lime this one is drinkable with a creamy texture. Kind of intriguing peppery beer with lime. Not a lot of hop or other flavours.
"
1," Hazy yellow pour. Aroma is dominated by citrus and lemon. Very strong fruit notes in the taste. Has a nearly juice like quality.

1," Chestnut-amber coloured, small and stable off-white layer; delicate caramelly nose with a metallic touch; moderate bitter-sweetish flavour, light bodied; metallic traces, again, in the slightly bitter and sweet finish. Brewed in a brewery very close to the bohemian border (""Bhmisches""), but far away from an average bohemian ""Tmave""............

1," Very watery. Balanced malt/hop flavours with a light maple flavour which is more prominant in the aftertaste.

"
1," Had on tap at the brewpub. Has a nice copper colored appearance, off-white head with a little bit of lacing. The aroma has a twinge of caramel to it. Solid malty flavor with a bit of candy-like sweetness to it. Turns a tad bit artificial on the back end though.
"
1," Pours dark reddish brown with a thick foamy tan head. Initial aroma of raisin, sweet malt, and toffee. Not nearly as fruity as I remembered. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and slightly sticky with foamy carbonation that stings a bit more than a typical Belgian, perhaps its just the fresh alcohol. Enjoyable, but not terribly impressed considering my impression of previous bottles. It has been at least a year since my last bottle of Blue, and while I remember it being considerably more tasty,  I think it is more likely that my perception of taste has evolved.
"
1," DEC 5, 2011 2004 0,75cl bottle. Nice aroma and color. Fruity taste. Those 9% are well hidden. Left me with a great aftertaste. Best of three chimays that I tried. Propably my favourite beer so far. 4.6		2011"
1," 750 mL bottle from my local Farm Fresh, purchased 1 year ago.  Reddish-brown pour with a huge, foamy off-white head.  Aroma of pear, apple, grape, brown sugar and Belgian yeast.  Flavor is mostly raisin and apple peel with some Belgian candi sugar.  A good beer but probably my least favorite of the Chimay beers.
"
1," Tried this one at the Belgium Beer Cafe. Served in a small glass with a large head. Aroma seemed very faint to me, but of fruit and yeast. Complex tasting beer, with fruit, alcohol, yeast and malts in mixed in. Has that high alcohol warming to it. One I definitely want to try again.
"
1," Draught at the Charlotte, NC Rock Bottom location. Clear copper color with thin off white head. Big flowery hop nose. Flavor is distinctly hoppy, but well balanced with malty caramel flavor. Dry and bitter throughout. Bitterness lingers.
"
1," MAR 11, 2010 12 oz bottle from US Liquors.  Milk chocolate color, thin tan head that dissipates quickly.  Aroma and flavor is slightly yeasty, I get a lot of dark fruit in both the aroma and flavor with some sweetness and caramel coming through in the flavor.  Finish is sweet and smooth.
"
1," 330ml bottle, 9% a/v		From Chimay christmas pack at LCBO stores. 		Pours a cloudy dark brown with a nice tan head which laces very well. The aroma is floral, boozy with some roasted malt and nut. Taste is sweet and spicy at once, Very boozy warming feeling as well. This is an incredible beer but its hard to accuratly describe the taste. Its diffrent every sip. Orange, cloves, cinammon, roast malt, toffee, chocolate, raisins and liqorice. Pretty much any flavour you can imagine is in there. There is also a very noticeable changing of the flavours as the temperature changes.		Damn Good Beer.
"
1," Bottle.  Pours a very hazy yellow with a thin white head. The aroma is full of citrus, coriander and a bit of malt.  The taste is very sweet, with just a touch of coriander, but mainly citrus, with a slightly tart finish.  Start up the lawn mowers, because this beer is perfect for summer sipping.
"
1," Bottle from Csakajosor.hu. Poured murky, dark burgundy-brown color and a beige lively foam that eventually became a lacing one. Plum, caramel, cinnamon, mints, cellar, hops in the aroma. Not as dense as I expected, with pretty high carbonation. Sweet taste, which becomes even sweeter in the aftertaste. Good one.
"
1," Enjoyed a small bottle of this in a proper Chimay glass thsi Easter. Murky reddish brown with the thinnest of heads sits nicely in my cup with riseing carbination. The aroma is that special yeast as promised with some dark fruit or palmagranite in there as well. Flower aromas confussed me since i was drinking outside and was not sure if it was just coming fromt he beer or the budding flower garden. The taste was a lil bit booze but had a pleasent soft matliness to it. Great silky mouthfeel with a just right carbination level.
"
1," MAR 25, 2010 One of my all-time favorites.  I love abbey dubbels, and this has got to be the best one Ive ever tried.  Simply delicious and something every beer drinker should try!
"
1," (bottle)poured into a chimay glass.  good beer, I like this better than the more popular blue.  more on the front, better in the finish.  a great beer to enjoy with a meal, as I did.  I was suprised to like this better than the blue.  cheers...
"
1," One of my favorite styles of beer; however, I was disappointed with this particular one as it was too mild for a Scottish Ale in my opinion.It poured a large tan head with small bubbles.The body was cloudy with no carbonation observed.The hue was orange and the lacing was fair.The flavor was mildly malty and the mouthfeel was thin and smooth.
"
1," Huge, beautiful off-white rocky head that leaves a nice lacing. Hazy brown body with small and fast bubbles ascending to the head. Spicy aroma with honey, cinnamon, bread and coffee notes. Light to medium body very sweet.
"
1," Darker gold with white head and visible carbonation.   Malty nose but I also smell something akin to rotten fruit (very very faint), or could it be a Bret influence?.   There is a toasty malt flavor, almost dry flavor upon first taste.   Its almost smokey and a bit odd, although I can appreciate this unique twist.   Some citrus/lemon flavor (the hops?).   Doesnt really go together but separate it makes an interesting experience.  Given you dont drink flavors in silos I find this a bit of a confusing beer.   Upon further tasting, this really does seem to have a bit of a sour Bret side to it.  Not sure what to make of that interpretation.
"
1," This is a good vintage ale. Try to hide some of these in the back of your cupboard for 2-3 years.. You will experience a new beer, quite different from new chimay bleu. The sharp ""edges"" will dissapear end the ale will get a more port-like feeling with heavy notes of dried fruit like raisins or plum. A direct tasting between old and new is always exciting. 	PS be careful with storing corked version too long as the cork can ruin the beer
"
1," Courtesy sprinkle. Black with brown edges and a small, tan cap. Hiuge roasted coffee and burnt malt in the nose. Same flavor. Overpowering, simple but good. Medium, balanced body. Easy drinking. Solid coffee stout.
"
1," A yellow beer with a small white head. The aroma is malty and hoppy on a slightly sour background. The flavor is sweet malty with a light touch of hops.
"
1," (bottle) pours a clear ruby-amber colour with a small off-white head. aroma of roasted malts, barnyard, caramel and sweet spices, a tad musty. flavour is mostly strongly roasted malts with a hint of coffee, finish is like hamster-urine though. medium body and carbonation.
"
1," 750ml bottle. Rich mahogany hue with short lasting brindle (tan with flecks of various browns) foamy head fully diminishing, murky body with a thick density of medium sized particles. Moderate to heavy malty aromas - caramel, Maltexo, toffee, bread, with a plethora of complex fruity and spicy aromas - vinous, stone-fruit, banana, cloves, and some yeasty aromas - dough. Taste is heavy sweet, some mild bitterness makes a brief appearance then the sweetness dominates again with a long duration. Body is medium, texture is oily almost syrupy, carbonation is mostly lively leaving a tingly tongue, pleasant warming alcoholic finish. 	This was a really nice beer but may have suffered from high (97th percentile) expectations. Didnt quite live up to the hype for me. Still very enjoyable though.
"
1," MAY 19, 2010 Pours a deep dark brown and somewhat ruddy complexion.  The head is a little off-white and doesnt hang around very long.  Rich dark fruits like plums, figs, and raisins come through in the nose.  Maybe a touch of caramelized sugar, and molasses coming through as well.  Rather rich in the aroma...The fruits are rather strong in the flavor giving a dark fruity aspect to this beer.  Very bubbly mouthfeel and a rather light body.  The finish is somewhat sweet and complex.  Again, maybe a touch of browned sugar in the finish.
"
1," Small bottle, poured brown with full frothy light-brown head.  Head dissipated, but left nice lacing.  Aroma of mild hops, caramel, apple, and a slight hint of dark fruits (dates), with a touch of smoke.  For a dark beer, is surprisingly light/medium bodied, and quenching.  Flavor lightly hoppy, and light/moderately sweet.  Sweet finish, and soft carbonation.  When compared to other Belgian ales like Rochfort 8, not as sweet or aromatic, but is lighter and is one that I could drink a couple of.  Great beer!
"
1," JUL 21, 2007 Very smooth with just the right amount of flavor and alcohol.  So far my favorite Trappist.  Pours dark with a beautiful long lasting lacy head.  Aroma is a tease of what is to come once you pour this heavenly beer down the hatch.  Flavors are a perfect balance of fruit caramel and a bitterness end.
"
1," Bottle from IN. Light hazy brown ale, with a smalle big bubbled off white head.  Light malty aroma with a hint of nuts and hops. Very fresh malts, grainy and some grassy german style  hops.  Nuts come out as beer warms up. Lighter bodied. More like a Vienna.
"
1," Bottle shared by GMCC2181. Pour was brown to black w/ some reddish hues to it too (when tilted). The head was 1cm and had good retention, steady bubbles rising to the surface. The aroma was coriander spices, oranges, light yeast, some dark fruits. The flavor followed the aroma, nice fruity esters, phenolic spicing, coriander, oranges, mixed dark fruits, and light chocolate and faint smoke/roast in the aftertaste. This sucker had some nice flavors going on, and the only knock was the light (filtered?) mouthfeel combined with seemingly high artificial carbonation. Fix up the latter, and weve got ourselves a very fine beer here - enjoyable as is, though. Thanks, Gabe, for sharing!
"
1," Hazy mid brown beer with a sweet, caramelly aroma.  Fairly malty and with some flowery hop character and a strange wheaty/bread like character lurking in the background.  Rather sickly sweet finish, a bit too sweet for me.  Beware if you do the little train here from Ljubljana, it's opposite Rodica station not Domzale - it's a 20 minute walk from there (as we found out).  (sampled on draught in the brewpub)
"
1," A great trappist, but not the best Chimay definetely. Has an extravagant taste but yet with not a variety of flavours. The aroma is of a roasted alcochol something like a barnyard-if you know what I saying (yeah you do since you are in a beer loving site).
"
1," Clear light copper color with a tall lasting ecru head. Pale malt with earthy hops undertones. Some citric hops in the background with a sweeter tint, oranges and rudy red grapefruit. The scents seem a bit thin with no real depth. Lots of citrus flavors with tang and just a hint of butterscotch. Finish is lightly sharp with some pine tar and biting citric pith.LInger has a touch of malt and caramel to help smooth things out. I find this closer to an APA.
"
1," Catching up on old notes. Dark brown with head.  Dry woody aroma.  Chocolate coffee dry woody vanilla with clean woody finish.  Pretty good.
"
1," My first Chimay, poured from a small bottle into a glass.  Dark amberish in color, with a thin light head, followed with some lacing.  Aroma isnt too distinct at first, but comes out as it rests a minute.  I notice lots of nutty malt, maybe a little coffee, and a lingering very light licorice.  The real treat is the taste.  Very creamy and smooth on the palate, and lighter than I was expecting.  I will definately enjoy this exceptional brew again.
"
1," Finally got to rate this after drinking numerous times. Large bottle. Dark brown with ruby glow, bit white head. Yeasty/banana aroma with some spice, maybe cinnamon and clove. Not as complex as I remembered (still complex though), firm body with malt and more spice, some bitterness, dry malty finish. Nice.
"
1," MAY 29, 2008 2007 1 pint 9.4 oz bottle. Dark brown color, light red hue. LOTSA head, as expected. My tulip accentuated the head more than a wine glass. This my third time with this beer. The flavor is  complex yet evenly balanced. The malt, some roasted, strong hops and yeast and floral. Mouthfeel so smooth the alcohol will surprise you. Ive purchased this beer a dozen times now, Mmmm..
"
1," A pale yellow slightly cloudy well laced beer. Solid banana aroma and flavor with tartness from the wheat malt and yeast. A nice summer brew.
"
1," Nice amber red color with creamy white foam. Theres a distinctive taste of caramel in this beer. A nicely balanced alcohol percentage pumps up its taste. Very nice beer.
"
1," namely chocolate or some kind of darker, harsher flavors to balance the palate. Sure theres a breadiness from the malts, but Id prefer something stronger, maybe even burnt-like to negate the sourness from the fruit. At least theres no bitterness or watery texture to the palate, so even the most inexperienced n00b could tell Chimay Blue is a beer with chutzpah. DRINKABILITYIve never been a big fan of bottle-conditioned beers since their abundance of yeast tends to make for extremely carbonated beverages. Chimay Grande Reserve is quite bubbly from the initial pour to the last drop and never shows signs of relenting. Therefore, its a very gassy beer which means its difficult to drink except in sips. The mouthfeel is rather heavy as well, although its actually quite smooth as goes down.I made a point of drinking Chimay Blue after a large dinner in order to prevent the 9% ABV potency from overwhelming me. However, I was quite surprised at just how quickly the alcohol went through my system. After less than one glass, Chimay Blue really made its mark. Additionally, the sheer density of the beer cannot easily be shaken off as its a brew youre going to notice for quite a while.FINAL THOUGHTSConsidering the reputation of this beer Im actually a little disappointed that I didnt jump for joy over Chimay Grande Reserve. I genuinely enjoyed the taste and appreciated its complexity, but was a little distracted by how much of a challenge the beer was to drink. Regardless, I can honestly say I liked it and would highly recommend it. At $10 for a 750ml bottle its a good buy, and if youre a beer connoisseur its practically a steal.NOTE"
1," 2008 Bottle from West Lakeview.   Pours a thicker near black with a small soda-like tan head.   Big crass aroma of bourbon, chocolate and coffee grinds with notes of vanilla and leather/dirt.    Flavor is actually pretty smooth, bourbon forward but has balanced supporting notes of chocolate, light roasted coffee, burnt molasses, touch of raisin, oats and creamy vanilla.  Quite earthy, especially the aroma.  Very fluffy but fine and smooth carbonation, medium body with a full mouthful.   This is like the standard brewpub bourbon-barrel stout, good but generic.
"
1," I was not very surprised of this beer. Though it has a fine colour and a creamy head, the complexity is not very high. I found some notes of fruit and yeast and that the alcohol is mild. Nothing extraordinairy.
"
1," bottle, Danke pivnizub! Golden yellow colour, medium-sized head. Full-bodied, bitter-sweet with some fruityness and hints of herbs.

"
1," NOV 10, 2006 Bottle. Let me preface by saying Im not the biggest fan of the style. Pours ruby-dark brownish, with a big tan head that dissipates swiftly. BIG - no HUGE  fruity aroma that yields to a slight malt ending. You would think such a powerful and vibrant whiff of fruit would be overbearing, but it lingers only momentarily and is balanced perfectly by the malt ending. A feast for your nostrils! I know thats a lot of words to waste on a simple smell - but this beer really smells great. On to the taste"
1," Attractive  oily black pour with rich rocky head.  The nose is roasted barley malt and chocolate.  Somewhat thin in texture, surprisingly in light of the thick viscour pour.  The flavors are roasted grain, chocolate, vanilla, but no wood, no bourbon, no barrel qualities to speak of.  OK.
"
1," Bottle. Brown color with a big white head. Fruity aroma with some malt and yeast. Light bosy, a little carobonated, but flavoir had some fruit, malt, and a touch of yeast. Easy to drink.
"
1," hmm. this used to be way up in the high 4s in my ratings for a very long time but now it has to be banged down a bit. hadda  99 magnum for xmas day by myself and it wasnt nearly as good as the 99 750 i had last xmas - maybe a bit corked? not much head, or only one that lasts 60 seconds, mahogany with heaps of floaties. woody vanilla + salt choc & tang flavours. very mellow deep malt flavours but thin and unexpectedly light otherwise, and strongly alcoholic (probbly way over 9%). finish had heaps of spearmint and peanut butter and wasabi plus strong alcohol. just not as velvety or mouthfilling as i remember. still a goodun though
"
1," Black in the pour; light brown head;  Chocolate and coffee flavor, creamy ans thick.
"
1," Sample at brewpub. Pours a dark brown colour with thin ring of off white foam. Aroma has some prominent malt but lacks a nuttiness. Taste is reasonably malty but again the nutiness is lacking. Okay.
"
1," 750ml bottle. 2008 vintage Id been saving to drink on my birthday, did not disappoint. Very lively when poured. Ruby, cooper colour with a thin head of almost tan foam. Aroma of wild fruit and berries with a hint of spice. The flavour moves through the mouth from top to bottom and front to back and leaves a lingering port aftertaste.
"
1," Not bad.  it is a dark belgian.  has the typical belgian phenol nose.   has some dark fruit in there to.  totally decent.
"
1," Great beer with a small touch of alcohol in the aroma.  Just enough alcohol to warm the senses and a wonderful taste to match.
"
1," 500ml swingtop bottle at Sokol resturant, Ljubljana, Slovenia 	This is considered their ""house beer"", and was very much looking forward to trying it.	Hazy orange body, with small inpersisant ring of white foam.	Aroma is bit towards the odd side; honey sweetness, clove, stewed apple, and overly ripe banana.	Low carbonation, soapy texture, body is a bit on the lean side.	More honeyish malt flavours on the body, odd peppery phenolics and clove. Overly ripe banana and pear esters linger on a drying finish.	Certainly a unique beer, im somehow reminded of a homebrewed wheat beer of sorts; its part one thing, part another. I have a feeling its could inconsistant in quality/flavour but well worth a try.
"
1," 50 cL bottle. Pours clear and golden orange with a small off-white head. Aroma is fruity and slight roasted malty. Yeasty, caramelish and fruity. Sweet and caramelish into a mellow and fruity finish.
"
1," Bottle, 33cl. Pours an unclear nutbrown beer with an offwhite head. The aroma is yeast and fruits. The flavor is fruits and yeast, with some alcohol. The palate is bold and balanced. Overall a good beer.
"
1," Pours a murky dark brown, with a large foamy head.  Aroma is very malty as is the taste.  I also get a caramel aroma.  Not bad but just not for me.
"
1," Pours a dark brownish amber color with a creamy tan head. Aroma of raisins, plums and caramel. Flavor is mildly sweet and mildly bitter, very well balanced. Creamy texture, lively carbonation. Good beer.
"
1," Pours a muddy brown color with a beige head that has good retention. Forceful yeast aroma with some notes of grapes. Vinous flavor with dark molasses and prevalent yeast. Some dry fruitiness along the lines of figs. No alcohol taste whatsoever.
"
1," Thin head with with little lacing. Murky dark brown in color. Aroma typical of belgian strong ales with a good amount of malt, fruit and a little bit of spice.  Good amount of alcohol taste. Slightly sweet but smooth little warming finish. A nice strong ale, but as nice as many others.
"
1," Bottled. Strong skunky scent, very bland. I may have to cut back on lagers!
"
1," Bottle. Sour/apricot aroma.  Hazy amber/brown body with Tall fluffy head.  Sweet flavor with hints of bitterness. Taste of citrus and malts, very creamy.

"
1," Draught at the brewpub.  Amber-brown without much head.  Rich nutty aroma with earthy dark sugars.  A full-bodied brown ale, with lots of deep, rich sugars and an underlying earthiness.  This is a good brown ale (not a mild).
"
1," Hazy amber coloured beer with lots of carbonation and a huge white head. Herby light malty hinted aorm awith some bitter and hoppy touches. Full light creamy palate. Finish is full malty, light herby with a sweet bitter balence. Dry yeasty ending. Not bad;
"
1," Not too bad for a light beer - have to satisfy the budmillercoors crowd.  Hopefully thisl get those b-m-c goobers to try REAL beer...
"
1," Deep red copper with a creamy off-white head that slips away pretty quickly.  Instantly the aroma of hops, spice and fruit fill your nostrils.  Sweet from the fruit and a pinch or caramel, bitter, wheat, and a silky finish coats your mouth.  Slight flickering of spice, I think clove and I picked up apples and raisins at some point.		Super stuff !
"
1," JUL 25, 2003 Call me silly, but this is my preferred Chimay. I find it the most complex on the palate and the most varied as it warms. It also offers one of these 'plus fours' ala Shulgin more often than any other beer for me. Unbeatable creamy mousse over an amber-brown chalice. A unique well-blended harmony of malt and hops -- perfume, tobacco, tart, alcohol pepper, creamy feel and very easy mild bitter finish.
"
1," A great Belgian ale, a bit hazy deep brown, not to much carbonated or to much sugar. A rich complex taste that is very rewarding. A rather smooth beer of high quality.
"
1," Deep golden to light amber coloured, small, lacing and persistent off-white head, distinctive fruity (dark berries) and dark-malty nose with a tinge of molasses and hops in the wings; medium to full bodied, full sweet-bitter flavour; solid malty-fruity finish with hops and warming alcohol in the aftertaste. A moreish strong brew.....
"
1," Pours a hazy brown color with a 1 finger tan head. The head fades quickly on this one. Slightly red around the edges. There is a little bit of lacing on my snifter. This looks very similar to the others, just not quite as nice.		Aroma"
1," Cloudy unfiltered and capped with a small white spritzy head. Light banana in nose, but lacking and clove hefe character. A slight lemony tartness added to its thirst quenching ability. but overall a rather run-of-the-mill American wheat entry.
"
1," JAN 28, 2005 On Tap at the Chattanooga Big river (1/05).  Slightly sweet and very malty aroma.  Nothing special about the appearance (what you would expect a brown ale to look like).  Flavor was not as good was the Vienna Lager but had a distinct nutty brown ale flavor (toasted malts).  My second choice while I was at their establishment.
"
1," Pour is a dark red with a large white head.  Aroma is some dark fruits but not much else.  Flavor is malty and again dark fruit but nothing again stands out.  None of the usual yeastyness that i would usually get with a Belgian.  For being one of the six trappist brews this is one kinda of bland and boring.
"
1," Quite unceremoniously, this was my first growler purchase ever. What a better way to hang at the beach than to grab a growler of a brewpub beer. This was much better than their IPA. Poured an opaque brown colo. Nice nutty almost strangely sweet aroma. Big almond flavor. Medium body, decent carbonation and a pretty dry finish.
"
1," Draught at the Charlotte, NC Rock Bottom location. Black opaque with bubbly brown head that laced the glass. Roasty chocolate nose with pleasant milk chocolate flavor with coffee undertones. Sweet throughout with smooth finish. Very good stout.
"
1," Bright light gold brew sitting in the clear bottle noisy short lived cap produced during pour, looks ok for the style. Lemony lager aroma with hints of skunk and corn. Malts come across as sweet and grainy, mild mild skunk on the tongue. Flavour is more of a lime then lemon, no bitter at all. Crisp and relatively clean. What ever if you try to compare this to most other ""Beer Geek Beers"" its horrible and it will fail, but if you judge based on what it is a pale lager this very good and well above average. GOOD JOB DEAD FROG!!!
"
1," A pleasant belgian ale with contemporary flavors, color, and palate. This is quite a good ale overall, but lacks anything new in character that cant be found elsewhere commonly. Still recommended.
"
1," Brown colour, very licorice, too sweet aroma and taste. Some bitterness. Chocolate and carmamel and too malted, almond and vanilla flavour but more confesction essence flavour than quality natural, sweet in attempt to disguise that it doesnt all hold together, unfinishable.
"
1," Thanks DougTicket for the bottle. Poured a dark amber with minimal white head. The aroma was very weak to me and I had a hard time picking out much. There was a touch of gingery spice. The taste was full of spices with a solid malt base. I get a good dose of cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger. I found the spice a little overpowering by the end of the bottle. Mouthfeel was smooth and quite highly carbonated. Decent christmas beer but too heavy on the spices for my regular enjoyment.
"
1," (Bottle 0,5l)	Sweet, light honey(?) aroma. Clear light golden color. Quickly done white bubbly head. Medium sweet, light honey(?) taste. Medium body. Very light bitter finish.
"
1," The bottle poured hazy dark brown,about the color of the bottle, with dissipating off white head and good lacing. Sweet yeasty aroma, like honey, with some pungent notes of fermented roasted malts. The flavor is only mildly bitter,roasted, with balanced acidity, and spicy like corriander without losing that sweetness. The palate is full to medium with approachable complexity and the alcohol is not overwhelming. Delicious and admirable.
"
1," Dark brown pour with a beige head, strong notes of fruit and some hops, flavor is fruit, yeast with some bitterness, finishes dry with presence of alcohol.
"
1," This beer was the only one offered at a ball game other than BMC, and for the same price, I was in for a treat! Orange, wonderful aroma -- floral.  Nicely hopped with a citrusy and malty finish.
"
1," Nice copper color with some white head. Not much though. Some malt in the aroma and flavor. Smooth and enjoyable. On tap at the brewhouse in Chattanooga.
"
1," Bottle. Deep dark brown colour with a beautiful big off-white head. Aroma of toasted malts, yeast, fruits and some spices. The flavour is very much malty and spiced with a good fruitiness, yeast, alcohol, nice sweetness and flowery hops. A great great brew! Several years tasted after being stored for some years.
"
1," FEB 17, 2004 dark brown pour, some red. Aroma of sweet fruit. Again fruits in the flavor with some malt, with a slight alcohol finish. Very nice belgian.
"
1," Bottle. Golden color, frothy head. Cole slaw aroma. Grain and apple in the flavor, with a light character of skimmed milk and old hops.
"
1," Bottle, thank pivnizub. Fairly honeyish nose. golden, fine pearling bubbles, lacing off-white cream. Honey, light hay, a hint phenolic, metallic hops, slightly oxidized, but I think its a older bottle. Medium body, sparkly mouthfeel. perfumed finish.
"
1," An orange appearance with a very malty flavor. Some nice bitterness in the aftertaste.
"
1," Bottle. Dark amber colour with a off-white head. Dusty, corn, light caramel malt aroma and a light sweet caramel malt, straw taste. Medium body with a sweet light dry finish.
"
1," Smell is coffee - but almost a sour note in the background. Flavor is pale and non-impressive. Just like drinking a weak coffee at Dennys.
"
1," Bottle courtesy of sigma23...THANKS TIM!!!  Really enjoyed this one...poured a deep dark brown with a creamy latte head that left spotty lacing.  Cocoa, roasted marshmellow, and toasted malt on the nose.  Flavor is extremely well balanced and exhibits strong chocolate, oak, and just a hint of bourbon.  A tad thin but highly drinkable.

1," Bottle.	Hazy amber coloured with an off white head.	Fruity aroma of caramel and bananas.	Flavour of bananas, spices and fruits with acidic notes.
"
1," About a half inch thick head of rather large fluffy beige bubbles.  Light milk chocolate, roasted malts. a hint of dark fruit and a bit of musty wood.  Color is a very dark brown.  Flavor is a little weaker than expected but what is there is quite good.  Dark roasted grains, more cocoa, pasty malts, some burnt biscuits and an underlying tartness.  Little bit dry on the palate.  Light alcohol presence and warming.  Finishes roasty and malty.  A decent Belgian Ale.  Thanks to **** for this one.

1," 37.5 cL clear bottle. Pours a clear and pale yellow, no head. Aroma is sweet and dense apple. Sweet almost dextrose dense flavoured. Intense sweet apple flavour. Lasting sweet and apple concentrate finish. Citric finish, shivering citric. Lasting dense apple flavour impression. Lovely ice cold.
"
1," Reddish coppery colour. Big quickly dissipating head. Very nice medium sweet and spicy aroma. Flavour is spicy, but less fruity than the other Chimays. Finish is only lightly bitter and quite refreshing. However, the body is too thin and watery in order for this to truly be a top beer.

1," Medium orange-amber in color.  Thick off-white head (not lasting).  Cinnamon, belgian yeast bright scent, some kind of fruit too.  light bodied.  tastes like sugarless fruit, maybe grapefruit (citrus hopps).  highly carbonated.  Thanks Chuck...
"
1," On draught at the brewpub. It pours a cloudy grapefruit hue, with a small suds head that leaves light lace. The nose is of heavy yeast and sours. Lots of dough and yeast flavors, a hint of citrus, and a slightly grainy finish. The body is smooth with a creamy palate. Not very complex, and a bit underwhelming.
"
1," AUG 6, 2004 Yeasty taste on my tongue; after tasting.. Clove? Need to try this again.
"
1," Strong malt aroma, somewhat fruity toffee flavor.
"
1," Dark red brown beer with nice head.Malt,yeast,caramel,bitter hops,light fruity,dry finsh.
"
1," 1999 bottle at Kulminator. Deep russet brown color with a creamy off-white head. Vinous aroma with raisins soaked in dark rum, chocolate and port. Also dust and old books which sets me off a little. Taste is dry but with a slight alcoholic sweetness. I think I would like this better when its a little younger, not having those flavors of dust and old books, but this was still a very solid beer.
"
1," On cask at The Bow Bar. Pours a red - orange colour with a fair beige head. Aroma of caramel, treacle, candy sugar and clotted cream. A big alcohol hit with other flavours of treacle, caramel and yeast. Mild carbonation and an oily mouth-feel. A long alcohol hum also. Alcohol overpowers here with no real sense of balance.
"
1," 330 ml bottle @ home. Rated @ 17.6.2009.	Hazy brown colour with a medium head. Loads of sweetness on the nose; fruits, caramel, licorice and chocolate. Very warming mouthfeel with notes of dark fruits, caramel malts and hops. Medium bodied, thick mouthfeel and lively carbonation. Classic trappist beer.
"
1," Bottle. orange colour with a white head. Malty, straw, hoppy aroma and a sweet malty, grainy taste. Medium body with a light dry finish.
"
1," Rich amber pour with a whitish head that disappeared remarkably fast. Sour oranges, grapefruit, resiny aroma.  Flavor has some great citrus peel bitterness, earthy hops, light honeyed malt flavor.  Very good beer.
"
1," 12-ounce bottle left over from WBC 06. Very nice red ale but not distinctive in any way. Straightforward balance of malt and hops, good red color. Well made but unexceptional.
"
1, dark amber.	Aromas
1," fruits, brown sugar, caramel, bit touch of roasted malts.	Medium body.	Taste full, sweet, caramel, bitterness, little roasted malts.	Good.
"
1," Draught@brewpub (Portland, OR)	Pale amber color, small white head. Light papery maltyness in the nose. Like their ESB - very weak and watery. Lacking malts and hops! Flavor has some hops and light citrusy notes.
"
1," scent is of belgian yeast and some floral aspects as well.  taste is of yeast and citrus.  nice medium carbonation makes for a pleasant experience.  I would purchase this again.
"
1," Cobwebby and musty smell with lots of caramelly malt notes, some nuts. Alcohol extremely well-masked, but it has a helluva kick. I was expecting something incredible, instead it's just a very drinkable and perfected version of the Belgian strong style; none of that nauseating aftertaste I've come to expect.
"
1," Bottle, thanks to NachlamSie. Pours thick and black like tar, with some mahogany only at the extreme edges; brown, slowly-fading head. The aroma has a lot of sweet chocolate, nuts, and some coffee and toffee. Come to think of it, it reminds me a lot of chocolate biscotti. The flavor is very nutty with some roastiness and bitter chocolate. The finish is mellow and toasty. Has a nice oily oat texture. I like it.
"
1," 11.2 oz. bottle. Pours an exuberant head which completely disappears, lovely rich brownish color, nose is hard to identify with multiple layers flowing in, spice, malt, yeast, taste is similar, with yeasts dominating, finish has malt with a bit of hop. I am beginning to think Belgian strongs are my favorite brew style.
"
1," Pours thick hazy brown with a foamy tan head. Light floral aroma with hints of yeast, caramel and malt. Round, rich flavor of perfectly roasted malt, sweet fudge and raisins in total harmony. Finish is slightly vinous with a touch of alcohol. Very well balance with a thich, full mouthfeel with bubbly carbonation.
"
1," Poured a deep hazy brown. The aroma was sweet with hints of ripe fruit (grapes/raisins), alcohol, and maybe caramel. The head was medium thick and brown. The flavor was sweet and tasted of ripe fruit with alcohol showing through. The palate was very full and well carbonated. The finish was warm from alcohol. Overall not as impressed with this as I thought I would be. Then again I have yet to be blown away by a Trappist.
"
1," pours a clear yellow with a small white head. notes of corn, grass.  crisp hops.  subpar.
"
1," Bottle. Pours a dark, somewhat hazy, burnt red color with small white ehad. The aroma is oranges, wildflowers, and a bit of spice. The flavor is semi-sweet malt, bitter hops, yeast, and a touch of cloves.  It comes together pretty well, but doesnt linger at all.
"
1," 12 ounce bottle, little stamp on the bottom of the 4-pack container says best if used by 7 15 12.  Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown with about a half inch tan head that went away quickly.  Theres a decent amount of lacing.  Aroma is weak (but nice), the beer smells like dark fruit, molasses, and a bit of coffee and chocolate.  The brew tastes like dark fruit (figs), red wine, roasted malt, coffee, dark fruit and a little bit of honey and tart berries.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, its creamy and coating and is well carbonated.  The soft carbonation makes it easy enough to drink.  The longer I drank this, the more and more I liked it.  Worth a try.
"
1," 330ml bottle served in a chalice. Bottle conditioned. Poured a hazy dark amber with a thin off white head. Fruity aroma with some peppery spice. Medium to full bodied with some malt sweetness. Rich mouthfeel. More fruit in the flavor. Spice in the finish and the signature Chimay yeast flavor. A little hop bitterness in the finish as well.
"
1," Draft. Amber with an off-white head. Bitter hop aroma and flavor as expected. Very drinkable IPA.
"
1," Very nice beer.  The 9% ABV caught me a bit off-guard.  Great head retention and malty, spicy aroma.
"
1," Golden copper with a thin off white foam.  Aroma of caramelized malt, toasted malt.  Taste is the same caramel and toasted malt but feels watery.
"
1," OCT 24, 2008 75 cl bottle, Grande Rserve (2007 vintage). One of the best beers I ever had. A nice taste of raisins, soy, chocolate and coffee. Sweet and warming alcohol. (4,3)		Jan 25, 2008, 33 cl bottle at Pitchers Pub, Karlstad, Sweden (2007 vintage). Dark brown colour with at thin white head. Malty aroma with chocolote, coffe, raisins and sugar. Sweet flavor with fruit in the background. (4,5)		Jan 31, 2008 (1999 vintage). It was a very nice experience. Matured plums, portwine/madeira, some brown sugar, raisins and some soy sauce together with broth(?). Very, very nice experience but to be honest I think it was better a couple of years ago.		June 18, 2008 (2007 vintage). This is still a very good beer, but unfortunly I didnt find it that amazing this time. I prefer a Rochefort 8 every day over this one. I dont say this isnt high quality though. Probably need too store a couple of these, even though I like the fresh ones.  They need to rest standing a couple of weeks before drinking though... otherwhise they explode spreading beer all over the appartment. (4,3)		Oct 24, 2008"
1," Bottled. Dark brown beer with a big, light beige head. Complex aroma is a mixture of sweet fruits, spice, yeast and a hint of alcohol. I noticed at least bread, syrup, caramel, roastedness and some chocolate. Lovely vanilla notes too. A hint of alcohol in the finish. Flavor is syrupy sweet. Silky soft palate with hardly distinguishable alcohol in the finish. Amazingly easy to drink. One of the best beers that Ive had.
"
1," Thanks, JCB, for sharing a bottle.  Near black pour with bubbly off white head.  Chalky palate. Roasty malty flavor with not much yeast action.  Similar to dubbel.  Somewhat thin.  Okay.
"
1," Not bad at all.  Actually, I thought it was similar to Chimay Blue.  Where I live, this is a very common beer, so I know bars where I can get it regularly.
"
1," Clear dark copper in color with a medium light tan head. Mild malty aroma. Taste is slightly bitter and malty with a bit of a metallic aftertaste. I was not all that impressed.
"
1," Very light copper with a fizzy white head. Earthy barley aroma and a sweet malty taste and a clean finish.
"
1," 12oz bottle into a pint glass.  Black with a one finger mocha head. Aroma is sweet dark roasty malt, coffee.  Taste is similar with roasty dark sweet malt, dark bitter chocolate.  Very soft and milky texture perfect for the style. Not a bad oatmeal stout.
"
1," At Seven bridges Jacksonville.  From the tap poured drak brown with a good head.  Nice sweet malty flavor with a quick finish.
"
1," NOV 20, 2008 0.33l bottle few occasions		Pours a deep, dark muddy brown with an beige dissapearing ,head. 		Smell if fruity, malty, yeast and some alcohol, flavour is much the same, quite sweet, lots of yeast, bread, fruit, cherry and peach, and some alcohol but well hidden. Enjoyable and very easy to find which is a bonus.

"
1," Bottle from MiP, thanks! Golden color, hazy, big foamy head. Somewhat spicy aroma with banana. Thinnish, grassy, wheaty flavor with banana and mandarin. Strong aroma, but not really impressive.
"
1," Golden colour with a small head.  Aroma is light honey and malts.  Some hop flavour but mostly thin and sweet.
"
1," Pours a hazy light yellow with a thin white head. Aroma is light coconut little sour. The buttery coconut taste stands out the most at the start but fades to a bitter dry finish
"
1," Because of the wonderful, sweet, yeasty aroma and deep ruby color, I was expecting a lot when tasting this beer.  However, after tasting, I was a bit disappointed.  I dont really sense any complexity in the flavor at all, just a slight bitterness on top of minute malt characteristics.  And boy, did this beer have a lot of fizz.  The finish is very dry, but not entirely unenjoyable.  The bottle was only a year and a half old, so I sincerely hope that I didnt like it because it hadnt aged enough.  I will have to search for an older bottle, or buy another and let it sit around a year or two.
"
1," 22oz bomber-thanks to vyvvy for sharing this one.  dark brown with a huge soapy kacki colored surface.  big bourbon aroma, almost burning at first when cold.  as it warmed, vanilla, whisky and light chocolate came out with a light note of roasted nuts.  flavors are pretty one-dimensional.  mostly bourbon and light chocolate sweetness.  body is very thin and not really a good canidate for barrel-aging if you ask me.  needs to be a higher gravity beer for this one to be better.
"
1," (Cask conditioned). Sampled at the Wear Valley CAMRA Beer festival, where it was served at room temperature with no carbonation whatsoever. Dark ruby colour, exquisite aroma, a bit thin mouthfeel, pleasant mild spicy flavour. Recommended! Would love to try it again, preferably slightly cooler at a Hebridean pub.
"
1," Amber hued with a creamy small head. The aroma has notes of pineapple, mango, biscuity malts, and a hint of salt and minerals. The taste starts with acidic fruit and moderate bitterness. Light malt background leads to a metallic finish. Balanced true enough but also lacks the hop punch I expected. The mouth feel is sticky and lively, actually pretty refreshing for the size and nature of the beer. By the end I still was left wanting more from this beer but it appears that the keg at the fest is better that some people have had lately.
"
1," Draught @ Gasthaus Spreewlder, Dorfstrae 53, Schlepzig, Brandenburg, Germany 15910.Unclear matt medium to dark amber colour with a large, frothy, good lacing, mostly lasting, off-white to light beige head. Aroma is moderate to heavy malty, roasted, nutty, caramel, licorice notes. Flavour is moderate to light heavy sweet and bitter with a long duration, chocolate malt, nutty. Body is medium, texture is oily, carbonation is soft. [20110919]
"
1," AUG 30, 2003 This is a really great, smooth Belgian ale.  The flavor isn't as complex as the Rouge, however.
"
1," A very typical example of this style.  Has nice balance, with some bitter chalky aftertaste that was highly annoying.  Other than that, clean crisp and drinkable.
"
1," Murky brown in colour with a small beige head. Aroma is bread, brown sugar, pear and raisins. Robust taste with brown sugar, malt, dates with a good balance between the sweet elements and the subtle hop bitterness.
"
1," An unexpected surprise at The Wyndhams wine and cheese party. Pours mahogany with a thick beige head.  Aromas of brown sugar, citrus, caramel, and some red fruits.  Tastes a bit yeasty, peppery, lots of red fruits.  A perfect balance.
"
1," Has the look of a homemade beer.  Dark orange-brown with a thick thick tan head.  Yeast, caramel, dark fruit i.e. plums or raisins in nose.  Very creamy somewhat sour palate with a bit of malt in there.  I can see why this one is a highly rated beer here.
"
1," NOV 13, 2007 The best beer I have ever tasted.  No beer in the world gets a perfect score, but this one is as close as it gets.  A perfect Trappist Ale is this Belgian Dark Strong Ale.  Too expensive at $13 for a 750 ml, but I still drink a bottle every couple of weeks if I can !!
"
1," Bottle--I dont know, I guess my nose hasnt been up to it lately, the only aroma I detect is some plum.  The beer is dark, almost a mahogany color, with a small head.  Good full flavor without anything overwhelming any other flavor.  Perhaps the malts are the most dominating flavor and perhaps theyre not.  The finish had a touch of alcohol, but the finish was smooth.
"
1," AUG 1, 2006 I have had this several times, but I ended up getting this at the Music City Brewers Festival. After standing in line at Catawba Brewing to discover that they were out of beer and we were not even half way through the day (they were obviously more concerned with selling stupid Tshirts). Big River Grille was next to them and had no line...and beer! Pours brown with a thin beige head. Brown sugar and nutty aroma. Medium thin body. Sweet caramel, nutty, and graham cracker flavors. Very smooth finish, with enough hops to bring it into balance. This is a session brown ale, and a solid one. Great crossover beer for those wanting to explore craft beer.  Its not barrel aged, imperial, high ABV, or whatever. Why knock it?
"
1," A beautiful brown color with a  brownish foam. A nice aroma. An excellent sweet and spicy taste, with a nice almost bitter aftertaste. A must try beer.
"
1," Bottle 33 cl. Poured brown colour with off-white head. Aroma is fruity mixed with some spices and raisins. Flavour is a bit sweet, some fruitiness. Quite nice beer.
"
1," Looking forward to this at the Troon Beer Festival in September 2004 and was bitterly disappointed. Cask, handpump dispense. Ruby black in colour with a very poor open buff head. Strong sulphurous aroma with notes of rotting seweed on a summers day wafting through. Thin watery mouthfeel and poor to non existant lacing. Dark malt gives a very poor insipid weak base with a slight note of burnt toast and diluted ribena juice. Poor hop content in the weak aftertaste, can just about make out a dusty bitter note. Weak malty watery finish, one of the worst bodies I have come across, completely lacking in depth and complexity. An Old Ale in style but failing on all levels. One to avoid.
"
1," Pours a dark coppery color with a thin off white head.  Aroma is mainly of yeast with some dark fruit.  The beer is actually relatively sweet with some sweet malt and fruit.  Light carbonation feel.  Decent beer, but I dont like it as much as others I feel.
"
1," This beer is wonderful, not as strong as the grand reseve but still has full flavor.  You have to have a glass for this, the sedement is rather bad at the bottle of the bottle
"
1," 12 ounce bottle from Blue Max in Burnsville, MN (June 2007, consumed a bit above fridge temperature from a Unibroue glass.  Largish, frothy off-white head decays slowly above the dusky, murky walnut body.....light hazelnuts and vanilla are almost subsumed in a somewhat off sour grapiness that muscles into the nose....the body is quite dry, lightly tart in the middle and rather burnt/toasted at the finish, with again a bit of grapy sourness that just doesnt work; the nutty, dark malts are there, but barely so....body is on the thin side, carbonation is strong and soda-like; quite dry on the palate.  Not terribly pleasant.  Nice label, though.
"
1," Draught at the brewpub. Its murky, warm golden with a creamy head. The aroma has notes of malt, or rather actually more newly harvested grain, a little caramel and yeast. The flavour has a light sweetness and notes of malt, newly harvested grain, light caramel and it ends on a slightly dry, citrussy note. The balance is quite nice.
"
1," Bottled.  Golden colour, average head. Sweet and buttery with notes of plastic and vegetables. Medium bodied with mushy mouthfeel. No bittetrness. Heineken-y.
"
1," Bottle, bought in Massachusetts, USA.  Light yellow colour with a small head. Grainy skunky aroma with some hops. Flavour is grainy, thin, little sweetness, little maltiness and some hops. Not really that god but worth a try. So far the only beer I have tasted from Armenia.
"
1," A light bodied double that strangely has hints of rice in it...reminiscent of a Kirin or Sapporo.	I swear I did not have any sushi or Japanese beers tonight.  Shaka Tamasna Kata Frata Brada!!
"
1," very sweet and fruity at first, then sour and spicy, with a strong and lingering candy-like finish. Aftertaste somewhat bitter. The 7 % abv will weigh you down easily, but theyre well integrated into the taste fabric. However, this is a very sweet-ish Belgian double, and if you dont like that kind of taste, steer clear of Chimay (also of the ""Bleue"" variety). You should drink this cool IMHO, otherwise the sweetness may become too penetrating. While this is clearly a well-crafted brew, I still favour the more bitterish English ESB equivalent. Still, good beer!
"
1," very rich flavored and fresh. spicy and delicious. Very highly appreciated. No doubt.
"
1," 12oz bottle from 2008 [been in my fridge the whole time].  Rating #100 of this brew.  Pours a gorgeous thick creamy shinny very near black with a great fine fizzy mocha creamy froth.  Aroma of nice creamy roast, seemingly woody from the oats, some sharp dark chocolate syrupy sweetness, faint touch of butter and molasses.  Flavor follows aroma exactly, woody dry roast, creamy dark chocolate, fairly bitter, seemingly quite dark, still some nice hop presence, off-dry feeling mouth-feel.  Medium bodied, creamy smooth with spread-out sharp fizzy carbonation.  Pretty good.
"
1," ...my favorite Chimay.  Light, balanced hop flavor, with a hazy color that complements it in the glass.  Fruitiness blends well with the hops to make a well balanced, beer that has a nice alcohol kick.  Another great from the master Trappist Monks.
"
1," tried in the 33CL bottle. nice creamy head, very fruity aroma, reminiscent of a dry red wine..also detected mild aroma of wood. dry from beginning through the finish
"
1," Bottle. Clear golden with no head. Flavour is apples, intense, sweet, little acid and citrus.
"
1," 12oz bottle from Marianos single rack. Pours hazy brown with tan head. Aromas of caramel, nuts, and a little fruity citrus. Flavors of caramel, light chocolate, good amount of malt, and a hint of citrus and brown sugar. Has a nice soft biscuity malt presence to it. Thought this was going to be another boring brown ale, but this one is at least sessionable at the very least.
"
1," 750 mL bottle.  Pours a light brown with a nice white foamy head.  Aroma and flavor are both sweet with the distinctive banana/cloves undertones that you expect out of this style.  Very tasty, and strong too, but you couldnt tell it from them taste.
"
1," Bottle, 33cl.  Pours an amber brown with a large lacy head.  Slight hint of bananas and spices.  Has a fruity slight yeasty flavor.  This is my favorite of the Chimay, and it tastes even better in the Chimay glass.  Great.....
"
1," The flavor has a mix of fruity (plums?) and spicy (corriander? cinnamon?), abit of faintly smokiness, and a big alcohol taste, blended seemlessly. Supposedly the crown jewel of the Chimay line ( I actually prefer the White), the is is a very complex and tasty brew.
"
1," Pours a hazy and murky brown-tanish color with a robust white head that leaves nice lacing.  Aroma is very fragrant--bananas, spices, yeast, citrus.  Start is sweet with some citrus/banana taste turning into a smoky/rose flavor, finally ending in just a mild bitterness.  A very well-balanaced beer.  I prefer this over the white.
"
1," Served in my goblet the appearance is party translucent (but not transparent) amber / brown, with a decent head and nice lacing. 		Smell"
1," Poured out a light clear amber with a big light tan bubbly cap that takes a couple of minutes to die down. Wow! This has incredible aroma - huge and sweet citruses that is very sharp and almost sour, massive peach, rrgf, apricot and candy - the usual suspects but the intensity and the lemony citrus is quite an eye opener. Hella sweet and potent, oranges everywhere and somewhere buried beneath is a bit of caramel. The blend of citrus things here is different than Ive smelt before. I taste things... things like huge citrus and brutal bitterness that strike within milliseconds of the first sip. Orange, tons of rrgf, lemon, more bitterness, peaches, caramel and a very long bitter finish. Sweetness and candy. Nothing new here but holy shit is this bitter. The aroma wins in this one. Decent carbonation. I dig this beer but got bored - this would have been more enjoyable if it was only a small bottle.
"
1," Bottled.  Pours dark, of course, some very delicate aromas including fruits, etc. Yeast and malt, actually finishes pretty clean for what it is.
"
1," 75 cl bottle. Grand Reserve 2001, sampled 2006.  Dark mahogny. Licorice in aroma. Flavor of chocolate and licorice. Carbonated palate
"
1," OCT 1, 2007 Bottle 0,33 Cl. Amber color with a persistent beige head. Fruity Aroma, the flavor is bitter and fruity. Mouthfeel is bitter and good		Portugus "
1," Bottled from the local supermarket. Murky brown color, foamy thick head. sour nose. Aroma is alcoholic with malts. Flavour is dominated by yeast. Very nicely composed. The BEER
"
1," Sparkling clear mahogany ale with a small, fizzy, off-white head.	The aroma is of milk chocolate, maple syrup and just a touch of evergreen. Perfectly balanced, malty, tangy and acetic flavor. Too light-bodied with a watery mouthfeel and lively carbonation. Short, crisp, clean finish. Refreshing. Doesn't really meet my criteria for an excellent brown ale, but I'm in Florida, the home of hot, humid Summers. This brew matches the climate nicely.
"
1," JAN 2, 2007 wonderful ale, a so subtile taste and flavor. Sweet and srong, its definitely a must.
"
1," Very balanced brew with a hint of sweetness.  Beautiful amber color, creamy head with a slightly dry finish.
"
1," SEP 1, 2004 havent had this for some time. It was my favorite some years ago, before I ever tasted the other Chimays. Its not the best Chimay but it is a very very good beer. Very rich aroma, taste is a bit bitter, very malty and slightly fruity.. good stuff!	re-rate. After one year of no Chimay Rouge I decided to have on.. and let me say, I was hugely dissapointed, somewhat in my memery this was a very nice brew, but now I see nothing special about it, it looks good, the aroma is slightly sour and a bit complex. The taste has that same sour stuff as in the aroma, I dont know how to explain it, but I dont like it (re-re-rate) the bottles now are quite good, that awful sour taste I found last time is gone and this is quite the nice dubbel
"
1," 330mL bottle.  Pours a slightly hazy copper with a creamy cream-colored head that lasts for quite a while.  Leaves decent lacing.  Aroma is sweet dark raisin with strong yeast and apricot.  Flavor starts off with spice, moves on to dried fruit (raisin and apricot), and finishes with astringent toasty fading to a long dry finish.  An excellent dubbel.
"
1," JAN 24, 2005 When I first had this beer, it was one of the first strong Belgians for me.  It blew me away.  Over the years, Ive felt that while it is a complex, tasty beverage, it has been eclipsed.  Whether it is me or the beer is debatable - and indeed the topic of the perceived decline of Chimay beers over the past decade is one of the most heated in the world of beer geeks.  Well, I finally decided to sit down and give this a proper re-rate.  Ive got a small bottle of 2004 from my local liquor store. The colour is kind of unusual in that there is a big disparity between the colour - under the light its a golden brown but in the glass its dark chestnut. The head is very light mocha.  The aroma is plummy, slightly bubblegummy with notes of honey, pears, sweet dark malts and a little bit of yeast.  Nice.  It has a sweet palate with pear, orange, and sultana notes.  A strong alcohol presence cuts through dusty yeastiness.  Flavour notes are well-fused, save for the obtrusive alcohol.
"
1," SEP 28, 2008 Bottled.  Clear golden, minimal head. Grassy and lightly buttery. Mildly sweet, well rounded and lightly fruity with dense, well defined malt and low bitterness. A well made beer without any surprises.
"
1," Thanks to my buddy Crazy E for leavin this beer around my house. Pours a darker brown color with a nice off-white head. Strong spice smell. Excellent trappist beer, with a great spiced and fruit flavor. Nice and carbonated with a nice spice aftertaste.
"
1," The filterless nature of this brew is probably one of the most interesting things about it. Smooth, clean, easy to drink with just a hint of bitterness.  This is a good dinner beer to augment a nice steak, although, a very rich meal would probably bland out the taste of the beer.
"
1," Bottle.  Pours deep ruby/brown, small tan head with good retention.  Aroma of sweet malts, yeast, brown sugar, and caramel.  Thick mouthfeel; crisp, tart, and dry, with sweet dried fruits, sugar, yeast, and well-hidden alcohol.  Nice lacing.
"
1," Deep, hazy ruby.  Fruity nose. Tasty yet not as complex as the blue label.  Red must get tired of living in Blues shadow.
"
1," This pours a golden color with a 1 finger white head that falls to a lingering cap, it has some small spots of lacing.		On the nose, I am getting a little hints of citrus and some faint pine, I can say not what I was expecting.		In the flavor, I get some carmel notes up front and some real maltiness. This is all washed away by some citrus notes(lemon and grapefruit) and a ton of spicy hop notes. It does have a little warmth from the alcohol but It does seem to be a little one sided.		It finishes with just a huge lingering bitterness and a hint of lemon zest. It is a little unbalanced but still worth a shot.
"
1," Bottle 330ml. clear bottle.Clear medium orange yellow orange color with a average to large, frothy, good lacing, mostly lasting, white to off-white head. Aroma is moderate malty, toasted, citrus - lemon, tequila. Flavor is moderate to light light heavy sweet and light bitter with a average to long duration, artificial citrus, tequila. Body is medium, texture is watery to oily, carbonation is soft. [20110128]
"
1," Bottle (kindly delivered by Quack-Duck!) Deep golden coloured, small foamy layer; sweet malt, a bit toasty in the aroma with a mineralic papery touch; sweetish flavour, light to medium bodied, a bit sticky; short sweet malty finish with a light bitter touch. Not too pleasant.............
"
1," I have not been able to find this stuff in Toronto for a while but I remember that it was the first trappist ale that I had ever tried, and I enjoyed it. My wife also enjoyed it and she is not a beer drinker.  It was very malty and had the taste of rasins. Would definitly buy it again if I could find it
"
1," Handbottled from trade wth Sprinkle. Pours a nice dark copper color with medium size off white head. Aroma of bourbon, malt , hops and oak. Slight smokey flavor with a bourbon taste in the initial sip. Flavors of malt, vanilla and hops still remain although none dominate the brew. Taste is still very enjoyable with a smooth and balanced finish.
"
1," First Iced Cider thanks to Maltzilla. Since this is my first encounter with this style I have nothing to go on really. Fruity aroma, apple  of course and possibly some cinnamon and spice. Just lovely
"
1," Bottle-poured a dark brown color w/a slight tan head. Deep rich sweet aroma of a classic Belgian. Sweet flavor of yeast, candied sugar, raisins, dates, figs, ...very complex w/a lot going on. Very smooth w/a rich mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden. Good effervescence. Long finish.
"
1," 33cl bottle. Deep orange colour, thick white head. Initial aromas are floral & spicy.  The orange rind flavour leaves a strong bitterness to the Blanche, a nice balance to the spicy and hoppy finish.  IMO not quite on par with Orval but a still a nicely balanced ale.
"
1," Not a big fan of this.  Maybe Barley Island didnt classify it correctly.  Really spicy ale.  Im a simple IPA guy....gimme the hops, citrus and caramel.  Leave the rest out of it.
"
1," Deep reddish brown color with a large pillowy tan head. Bready/oily aroma with no hop nose to speak of. So much smoother than the Red. A cavalcade of sensations to placate the palate. Out of the fridge I was tasting prunes, raisins and cocoa. As the beers temperature began to rise I was tasting curacao and nutmeg. An awe inspiring beer at any temperature!
"
1," Pours a small head that lasts forever over a cloudy red body, a smooth creamy palate. Cloves and banana. Flavor is pretty much a one hit of the same with malt.

1," Unimpressed. Not what I expected at all from a beer that I heard a lot about. The palate was confusing. Wasnt sure what it was all on about to be honest. Aftertaste was gunky. Too much $ for not enough reward.
"
1," 330ml bottle into a Chimay Trappist glass. A cloudy amber-tan beer with a medium sized off white head providing good lacing all the way down the glass. Generous aromas of cherries, oranges, caramel  and gentle spicy hops. Quite sharp palate with fruity flavours (again a hint of cherries), brown sugars and alcoholic warmth. Finishes with a pleasant gentle spicy hop bitterness that lingers in the mouth. It is medium bodied with a smooth drinkability. A fine Dubbel that is now widely available Down Under thanks to Dan Murphys and First Choice liquor outlets.
"
1," Bottle out of the Pond. Dark Brown and clear. Nice malty flavour with limited hops. Decent enough.
"
1," It poured a very dark red hazy liquid with a medium sized light brown foam.		It had a smell of yeast, ripe fruit, apples, oranges and nuts.		The mouthfeel was smooth with a thick body and a medium amount of carbonation. It had a taste of caramell, ripe fruit, plums, yeast and something sweet. Complex and nice beer.
"
1," citrus, raisin, spicey aroma, some sulfur presence, deep dark copper color cloudy with frothy white head, some sediment visible, light sweetness, some fruits, mild alchohol presence,medium body, lively, long finish,
"
1," Deep brown color, large head. Deeply malty and hoppy. Complex taste, blend of malts, spiciness (nutmeg, peppers, sandalwood) Nice flavor. Smooth and mellow. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean. Aftertaste has a definite alcohol bite (9%) and is rather dry. Taste mellows as you drink.
"
1," not the best tasting dark beer.		will have to try again to see if i notice any change.
"
1," This bottled brew poured a medium sized head of fine to medium sized white colored mostly lasting bubbles that left behind a transparent orange brown colored body with small sized floaties and a thick lacing.  The aroma was of mild hops and the mouth feel was also hoppy and tingly from start to finish.  The flavor was a good mix of caramel and strong hops.  Just slightly on the yummy side.
"
1," A bit disappointed with this one, taste is dominated by malty sweetness and yeast. Dry finish though, quite drinkable. Id like to try a bigger (and older) bottle of this.
"
1," from the bottle into my trappist glass, 	brown in color light bitterness, however not overdone. this is an exellent beer to just sit and enjoy.
"
1," bread, roasty, caramel, resin, citrus, dough, raisin, brown, red, hazy, cloudy, frothy, tan foam, minimal head, medium sweetness, medium bitterness, lightly sour, medium body, sticky, lively, astringent, - pours with a nice head, frothy, but dissipates rather quickly. dont see much lacing in my chalice. drank 5 minutes from fridge and finished my first glass as it was starting to warm up, seems more enjoyable as it warms, smoother, with less bite, can sense the ""boozyness."" Second glass confirmed. Tasty, but maybe a tad overrated?
"
1," Bottled. Amber colour, small off-white head. Aroma is fruity, grassy, mildly bready as well as some mild herbal and wooden notes. Flavour is floral and grassy with some sweetish malts. Quite British IPA like IPA, but also a bit bready.
"
1," 75oml. A great Belgian strong ale. its amazingly easy to find, and considering its a trappist product, thats very impressive. Pours a dark amber with a moderate tan head that dimishes somewhat quickly. Smells malty, flowery yeasts, and effervescent, with nuts, yeast, and a bit of dark fruit/plum sourness. Taste is similar, sweet, a bit bitter in the finish. the mouthfeel if pretty good, though not terribly active or creamy when swished around. Minimal lacing with a moderate release of gasses. cheers!
"
1," Bottle. Poured a hazy mahogany colour with a thick beige head. Clear malt and yeasty aromas with notes of apricot, dried fruits, spices and chocolate. Sweet malt, spice and dried fruit flavours with some astringency from the dusty yeast in the background. Quite a lively beer but not as satisfying as  the Chimay Bleue.
"
1," Pours copper with rich thick head...smells very dry with a hint of alcohol...very wine-like...tastes of caramel and dark fruits...a bit tart...beautiful...
"
1," Burnt orange with an ample tan head and big malty nose, this Oktoberfest is medium bodied and flavorful, but somewhat unrefined. A bit of harshness in the finish makes this one less than perfect. Quite hoppy for the style as well. A good brew, but could use improvement.
"
1," Definitely a much lighter beer than the bleu.    The head is exceptionally thick, but dissipates quickly.  A good beer, but id probably stick with one of the other Chimay offerings.
"
1," Bottle, dark brown with red tones, medium dark brown head, smells of molasses and bourbon, sweet and bourbon taste, mild bitterness at end.
"
1," AUG 9, 2007 Ah les trappists, ils sont si mchants avec nous pour produir une dlice comme a. Un arome lg de fleur, une saveur dlicieuse de malt roti. Un vrai pch. Et pour dire que cest des catholiques qui font a.
"
1," Copper color with no head.  Musty hop aroma.  Dry grain flavor with nothing else.  No bitterness at all.
"
1," bottle.  decent IPA.  good hop flavor...not overly strong but pretty smooth.  Id call this average overall
"
1," This beer is called Ice Pick Ale now... And they are going to stop making it... Good thing. Hoppy and citru nose(smells better than it taste) Pour light orange but a very watery body and mouthfeel. Flavor had no balence way to bitter
"
1," Bottle courtesy STFun. Pours black with hints of red and a thin white head. Sweet malt, roasty grain and dark fruit aroma. Smooth crisp malt, sweet dark fruit taste. Hard beer to classify, but tasty nonetheless.
"
1," I attended the 1st annual Beer-b-que yesterday.  The IPA was very good, and amazingly full.  I could definitely taste the caramel in this on.  I am more of a citrus guy when it comes to IPA, but it still was very good.  It made there lager taste pretty weak.  I had a great time by the way, could you throw something like that more than once a year.  I was a little disappointed they didnt have certified evil available.
"
1," If this isnt contaminated, its terrible.  Overly carbonated (contamination?)...poured 1/8"" beer and the rest head in a pint glass.  It smells like pizza crust.  Very hazy amber/orange color.  Large bubbly head that left some lacing.  Taste is sour, earthy (dirt) and oily feeling.
"
1," 500ml bottle bought at GBBF 08 and drunk at home.  Orangey gold with some floaters and a thin off white head.  Slightly malty and hoppy aroma.  Toasty malts.  I was worried about the floaters would mean it was off, but it was fine.  I drank it with some poached salmon and celery which went very well with it.  A malty lager.  Decent.
"
1," Slightly cloudy, warm. Approaching a barley wine in style. Sweet sticky finish with moderate bitterness.
"
1," 330ml bottle. Pours a brown colour with a thick, light tan head. Aroma of Belgian candi sugar, caramel, treacle, yeast and light black pepper. Nice flavour of Belgian candi sugar, treacle, caramel and yeast again. Little fruitiness with blueberry and raisin notes. Foamy mouth-feel and a spicy, peppery linger. Nice.
"
1," 750ml bottle best before 2013. Pours a dark hazy amber with a quickly disappearing head with no lacing. Smells of sweet belgian yeast and bread, prunes, some spices.  Sweet on the palate and can definitely taste the yeast - what a delicious beer!!
"
1," black, off white head.  toasty toffee-ish bourbon aroma with some chocolate.  flavour is sweet and boozy, but the body seems thin for the style and the barrel aging.  finishes roasty and mildly tart.
"
1," Bottle 75cl. @ yespr blindtasting. [ Bottle #26. ]Light unclear medium to dark orange color with virtually none lacing, fully diminishing, none head. Aroma is moderate to heavy malty, caramel, orange, overipped orange, moderate to heavy, overripped fruit, mandarin, phenol. Flavor is moderate to heavy sweet and modersate bitter with a average to long duration, phenol, fruity, apple - mandarin, overripped fruit, candy sweet. Body is medium, texture is oily, carbonation is soft. [20110219]
"
1," Deep amber, lasting off white head.Roasty malt nose.Nutty choc malt taste with slight cloying yeast
"
1," One of the best beers Ive ever had. The aroma is slightly sweet and roast-y, with a creamy mouth feel. The taste is almost like eating dark chocolate and fruit at the same time. Chimay Rouge is further proof that the best traditional beers come from Belgium.
"
1," Poured from a bottle 22oz. into a Chimay wide rimmed glass.		The color is a cloudy brownish/orange with a nice foamy white head.		The smell is of baked bread, and some really nice floralflavours.		The taste is a bit spicey, a mix of hops, floral and citrus. A hint of black pepper and rain flavor are evident at times.		This beer is the stuff of legends. I have heard many this about Belgian beers and this comes through much better than expected. It is clear that this beer copied and cloned but never surpassed.
"
1," Virginia Beer Fest 2007. Slightly hazy amber body with a small white head. Banana and caramel aroma. Sweet banana flavor but slightly syrupy in the end.
"
1," Bottle shared by joetheyounger.  Pours oily black with a dense tan head.  Aroma is roasty and chocolatey for the most part, maybe a bit of barbeque and toasted almonds.  Flavor is quite smoky and maybe some mesquite characteristics, along with a good deal of coffee.  Full bodied with soft carbonation.
"
1," Beautiful reddish-caramel color with a smooth fruity aroma. Warms all the way down with alcohol reminder in your mouth. Its never overwhelming with just the right amount flavor and bitterness. Spicey sweetness builds the more you drink with none of the cidery notes that the white label carries. This is truly the Champagne of Beers. Those monks out did themselves!
"
1," 1 PT. 9.4 oz. corked bottle. Nice pop when uncorking the brew. Made my dog jump a little. Sweet aroma came up from the pour. Light brown in color with a tan head. Taste matches the aroma. Nice malty sweet aftertaste. Nicely carbonated. Would like to get another to see how it ages. Worth every penny.
"
1," I first discovered this beer in a small hidden-away bar in Ambleside in the Lake District, England, and it has to be one of my favourites, with Leffe running it close for top spot. The white and blue are also good, but the palate of the red is delightful. Serve semi-chilled with a generous head, preferably in a wide goblet-style glass. The corked bottle adds a touch of class to a beer-tasting evening! The only down side really is the somewhat prohibitive price.
"
1," AUG 16, 2003 A dark honey color with a large frothy off white head. A small amount of sediment floating. Aroma is malty and sweet with hints of fruit. Lively carbonation. A smooth lightly bitter finish

1," From bottle on 05/11/09		Pours a dark amber with moderate creamy head.  Fruity, spicey aroma.  Wonderful taste and a very smooth beer that is excellent with dinner.  Slight bitter finish and a great beer to enjoy a few of in an evening.  First class in its category in my opinion - Cheers!
"
1," Bottle - June 06		Pours a beatifull mahoganny color with some red hues and a nice bubblybeige head that leaves some lacings. Aroma is fruity, plums, raisins, dried fruits maybe some green apple and a hint of alcohol. Taste is rather sweet, medium to full mouthfeel, swift carbonatation. Tastes of caramel,  port, vanillas, leaves a winey aftertaste. Not so complex and maybe even a little unidimnetional, taste doesnt stands up to the aroma. Drinkability is amazing for a 9% brew.
"
1," Dark brown body with a medium, receding tan head. A floral, and fruity aroma with sugar, a hint of alcohol, and roasted malt. The flavour is sweet, has dark fruit, pepper. Alcohol is evident but subtle. Some nuttiness in the aftertaste as well as fruit. Medium to full bodied and carbonaceous.There is a lot to it, but it is very balanced.
"
1," from a 75ci bottle. cork popped with a little umph behind it.  pours a beautiful dark brown with hues of red throughout. head starts out a little thick, with a lovely velvet texture to it. it keeps the velvety head through out . flavor is malty with a little roast character to it. very nice. also has slight hints of caramel throughout, but nothing too in your face . very well done. also has a semi dry finish that sneaks up on ya, and leaves your palate with a sort of dancing sweet sourness. awesome, very different then the first time I tried this.
"
1," 750ml Bottle. Pours a dark red with a nice fizzy beige head. The taste is a light fruit, hops, and good bit of yeast. It seems a bit dry sometimes, especially after awhile on the shelf. A light and easygoing drink, but really good. Much like a good wine.
"
1," Dark straw; relatively hoppy nose - grassy; crisp, moderate bitterness (~23 IBUs); sweet in finish; light pear esters as well (probably due to use of sugar); decent lager.
"
1," Awesome..............................	Wood fruit nose.  Dark in color.  Nice standing head.  Big wood sugar taste with warm alc feeling at the end.		Awesome...
"
1," ( 12oz bottle) Pours clear yellow with decent head. Nose of citrus hops, pine, and sweet malt. Tastes lightly bitter hops, oily body and not bad overall.

"
1," Dark brown pour unfiltered aroma of lightly sweet of dark fruits and yeast .... a smooth tasting brew dark fruits and light roasted malt .... sweet when you get to the bottom with the sediment .... a perfect job of hiding the ABV in this beer aged for a year ......... was just an excellent beer
"
1," 500ml bottle at Quinns, 26th April 2008 with Mes and renffisch. Pours cloudy amber with a vague malty aroma. Starts malt, but then theres a sourness and it leaves a nasty aftertaste on the roof of your mouth. I wont drink this again.
"
1," Spicy aroma. Sweet spicy flavour, too, similar to a pumpkin ale. Cinnamon, finger. Too much sugar and spice here.
"
1," Bottle.  Red brown pour with nice head.  Brown sugar, bread, coffee, cereal, liquerish, flower, tangy charbonation and some bitterness.  A fuller body would have made this a better balanced beer.  Pretty good beer.
"
1," From Koelschtrinker via trade.  Poured a cloudy pale brown color with a nice off-white head and spotty lacing.  The aroma was tons of sweet malts, spicy cloves and some yeast.  The flavor was clove, malt and yeast with a touch of unchecked alcohol.  Thin mouthfeel.  Drinkable.  Not bad.
"
1," A nice beer, but I expected something a bit more complex. Seems like a more flavorful version of the Chimay Red to me. Nice dark brown color, sweet malts and yeastiness. Has some dry fruitiness to it and some alcohol burn.
"
1," Once, an older relative produced a bottle of Chimay blue he had smuggled back from France - it was a mighty 9%!!! Of course we tried and hated it. Now of course its like a nectar of the gods - A murky chocolaty body, swirling with fine bubbles, a fine tan head. Flavours of port wine, sweet Arabian spices, autumn fruit and rich dark cocoa. The alcohol works well with these robust flavours, warming the palate gently. Its always reassuring that a beer as readily available as this still lives up to its reputation as a world classic.
"
1," Bottle from Cavie.  Orange brown pour with a small white head.  Aroma is earthy, caramel, and a little citrus.  Taste is bread, hops, very bitter, and caramel.
"
1," Bottle.  Pours dark brown with a small, fast disappearing head.  This is very aromatic stuff, with -get this- grape Big Chew bubblegum strongly asserting itself (and by no means does this mean it smells in any way cheap; its fantastic), then some raisin, sugar.  The flavour is of grape, raisin, dark cherry, with alcohol, more bubblegum.  Mouthfeel is medium with very little in the way of carbonation.  A keeper.
"
1," Pours a perfectly cloudy dark brown, with a nice light head.  A great looking beer.  Aroma is mainly of fruit, and typical of the Dubbel style.  Taste is similar, but with a bit of yeast to complement the sweet peachy flavor.  Palate is a bit fizzy yet slick, especially at warmer temperatures.  Overall a VERY good Dubbel.
"
1," A fantastic beer. I prefered this slightly over the Red mainly because of the finish. Due to the higher alcohol content, I was expecting more of a bit in the finish but it never came. Wonderful flavous of brown sugar and plum, with woody overtones. Cinq Cents is my favorite Chimay, but this is a close runner-up when in the mood for something darker.
"
1," Pours very dark brown, with a decent head and a fairly carbonated body that settled down after a little while, and with it the head.  Aroma contained some caramel, pear(?) and yeast, with some malt character coming out with tasting. Slightly bitter and a bit soapy on the palate. I was expecting a lot more from this beer, but Il definitely be tasting it again, though, so wel see what happens then.
"
1," AUG 28, 2010 Re-rating 27.08.10, as my old rating was far from the RB Average, (3.0) but apparently I just dont like this beer as much as you other do, since it ended on low 2.9 points this time  		It is an opaque red-brown beer with a dense head. The aroma is wood, alcohol, sourish hops and anonymous hops. Flavor is wood, menthol, much alcohol and a medium bitter finish. A bit thin palate, especially for the ABV. Medium carbonation.
"
1," Hazy amber ale covered by a tight and proud off-white foam. Good looks. Biscuity, toasty (and quite cerealic with a certain depth in that department) malt base supports the hop show going on above it all. While not the most perfumey IPA, this boasts a confident sprucey carnival, adorned with orangey notions aplenty. In mouth, their importance is magnified. The hops grow by the sip, entangling the back of the tongue with a rich bitterness, resinous, citrusy, insisting at length. Fresh, tasty and balanced by a full, engagingly carbonated palate. Exemplary IPA, possibly better than any bottled Qubec IPA.
"
1," JAN 25, 2005 Bottle. Hazy brown color, Sweet spicy fruity aroma and taste, Medium body and a light alcoholic finish.
"
1,"  over a decade ago, my friends and I would regularly visit Chattanooga, and would inevitable end up getting snockered at Big River off their house beer.  However, over the past few years as Ive become a horrendously unapologetic beer snob, Ive learned that pretty much everything I drank in my college years was utter crap.  So Im very, very pleased that Big Rivers Iron Horse Stout is so damn tasty after such a long interval between trips to this restaurant/brewery.  Sufficiently bitter and roasty with a smooth, chocolatey middle, this beer never gets mired in the metallic fruitiness that plagues so many smaller American stouts.  Plus, you get rich stout flavor without a daunting ABV, which is always welcome.  And I have no clue when it comes to beer-and-food pairings, but this stout was pretty good alongside my meatloaf.
"
1," Bottle.  Black beer with a light head.  The aroma is very fruity, airy and quite thin, the flavour is a mixture of grassy and sour elements with a watery dry finish.  Overall a poorish beer.
"
1,"  Pours a red coppery body, with creamy head.  Aromas of fruit, and hints of vanilla.  Tastes of fruit, and somewhat sour.  slightly feel the alochol on the finish.  I enjoyed this one!
"
1," 750mL --> trappist glass @ 47F.  Pours hazy brown. Medium white head sticks to glass.  Nose is cherries and prunes; earthy and musty.  Taste is sweet but not cloy and a little tart.  There is enough earthy hops bittering and roasted malt to balance the sweetness.  Almost no alcohol flavor is present.  The liquid is medium body with prickly carbonation.  Excellent.  One of the classic Belgian strong ales.
"
1," Great beer. Reddish-brown in colour with a thick head that lasts right through the drink. Just the right about of sweetness with caramel notes, mainly malt but nicely balanced by hops and some fruitiness as well. Splendid.
"
1," Pretty light yellow/orange.  Smooth and dusty on the nose mainly hop based. Pretty bitter with a honeyed cereal finish. Makes my teeth feel a little chalky. Some light green tickles of hop but relaxed overall.
"
1," 11.2oz bottle poured into Chimay trappist glass. Pours a nice brown color with a medium-thick, lingering head. Barely any lacing for a beer this thick. Very malty taste and aroma with the yeast clearly detectable. Creamy mouth feel that mirrors the look of the head. A truly delightful brew
"
1," A little bit of taste and aroma, with a hint of malts.  What else would you expect, it's a light beer.

1," A dark and very hazy pour with a lot of visible sediment.  A plethora of malty flavors, highlighted by coffee and a spicey plum taste. The changing flavors make each sip a pleasurable experience.
"
1,"  brown, with mild flavors of sweet malts, a hint of hops, and nuts.  Quite thin.
"
1," Tap (Big River - Nashville).  Pours a nice amber/coppery color.  Trace amount of head.  Aroma is mostly malts, with some citrus and yeastiness.  Flavor is mostly the same.  Medium body.  Average mouthfeel.  Very drinkable.  Would try again, but would not search it out.
"
1," Enjoyed from an 11.2oz bottle in a tulip glass.  The beer pours a deep ruby-colored/brown color with a nice off-white head.  The aroma brings fruit cake, raisons, Belgian character malts, and some yeast-derived dark fruity esters (which I found surprising, given the use of the Chimay house yeast).  The palate is deeply and complexly malty, showing some Munich at first, Special B, and perhaps a touch of aromatic malt.  The malt gives way to a deep and pleasing note of dark fruit.  The finish is semi-dry, and brings just barely a touch of alcohol that is more warming than present from a flavor perspective.  Overall, one of the best Belgian strong darks out there.
"
1," a weird and messy beer. lime rind and left over porridge. very citric bitterness in the finish makes it drinkable enough. a real oddity
"
1," Davanti a un mostro sacro dellarte birraria belga, bisogna portare rispetto. Laspetto  splendido, davvero invitante, color marrone scuro con una bella schiuma bianca soffice e cremosa. Nellaroma il caramello ha il sopravvento su tutto, sentori anche di frutta. In bocca  ancora un ottima birra, corposa, resinosa e con un finale caldo e lungo.
"
1," 12oz bottle.  Darkest brown pour with a huge tan head.  Nose of whiskey and roasted malt.  Flavor is malt and roasty coffee with a bit of whiskey and oak in the finish.  They didnt overdo it on the booze.
"
1," Poured a cloudy ruby/amber color with two fingers of head that quickly shrunk to a thin cap. The nose was of toasted malt, cherry and a mild yeastyness. The taste malty sweet tempered with some toasty grain notes. Cherry and alcohol contributes to the flavor creating a nice balance with the malts. The finish was bold and yeasty with light fruity esters. This was tastey and easy drinking. A little pricey but worth it.
"
1," On draft at Seven Bridges.  Pours a light brown with an off-white head.  Nose is sweet malt, nuts, and light tobacco.  Flavor is similar- sweet malt, light nuts, and a hint of molasses. Light to medium in body and ok overall.
"
1," JAN 31, 2005 I drank this shit while I was on mushrooms, so that I could fully appreciate the aroma and flavor.  The goblet glass was in full effect.  Damn.  I think that the gods spoke to me through this one.  My whole face was filled with hops and spices. I love it.
"
1," If ""sweet love"" had a flavor, this would be it. The monks have done us a solid with their Chimay products, this one in particular.  Smooth like velvet with hints of rusty figs and smooth pine cones.  This stuff is always on sale at Trader Joes.  Love it.  Perfect Belgian ale.
"
1," 12 oz. bottle courtesy of a trade with BBB63.  Pours a mostly clear dark brown with a very thin off-white head that had completely vaporized before my first sip.  Pleasnt aroma of lightly roasted malt and some floral hops.  The flavor is similar with light roast up front and moderate hops bitterness at the finish.  The aroma is perhaps a bit sweeter than the actual flavor.  As others have mentioned, not deserving of its low percentile rank - should probably be around 50 percent.
"
1," 330ml bottle. Yeasty aroma which translates largely into the taste. Slightly heavy body. Overall, a very good tasting beer.
"
1," Cask (gravity dispense), Reading Beer Festival, April 2006. Bright pale amber colour with lively condition. Cant say I picked up any of the off flavours that others did. That said, the beer didnt really capture my attention to any great extent. A light, fairly dry bitter with a slightly smoky malt character and restrained bitter hops. Lacked depth but went down OK.
"
1," What can I say?
"
1," 2007 Bottle thanks to bu11zeye. Pours with a deep brown body and a fading tan head. Aroma of brown sugar, light meat, fruity esters and chocolate. Taste is estery wheat, wet dog and vegital. Light bubbles.
"
1," (bottle) Murky brown colour with a big foamy beige head. Yeasty and clovy aroma with banana and sweet wheat malts. Sweet and fruity flavour, medium body, lively carbonation. Moderately sweet wheat-malty initial taste with loads of banana fruitiness and a note of bubble gum. Clovy and fruity crispy finish with a well integrated and warming alcoholic note. A good and tasty, even refreshing Weizen Bock.
"
1," FEB 24, 2008 11.2 oz. bottled poured into a Chimay goblet. Very deep tan head that fell to a thin layer that lasted throughout. Beautiful ruby color, almost opaque.	Aroma is of cherries, burnt sugar - almost like candy, and hints of alcohol.	Cherries and burnt sugar came through in the taste as well, along with other dark fruits - raisin, plum, fig. But also some hoppiness - this is a very complex beer.	Medium bodied, with high carbonation, although not the type that dances on your tongue like some other Trappists.	This is a great beer that really challenges you to find out whats inside - I imagine our oenephilic brethren would have fun with this one.
"
1," Pours to a hazy copper body with tons of large particulate and a tall lasting slick off-white head.  The flavor is full of toasty bread, interesting specialty malts, bitter herbal grassy hops.  Overall, pretty decent.  The flavor is toasted specialty malts and light herbal hops.  Quite toasty but also, that makes it more APA-ish.  The palate is bitter and medium bodied with a nice malty texture.  Very drinkable, but not overly superb.
"
1," Poured a redish brown color out of a bottle.  Havent had this in awhile, nice to return to it.  Very well put together beer, smells of grain, candi sugar, distant dark fruit.  Taste is caramel, candi sugar, some nuttiness and grain.  The carbonation is different than most, very fine, champagne like.  Classic beer.
"
1," skunky and adjunct flavored.  why, i dont know but id steer clear of this garbage unless you like BMC
"
1," 750ml bottle poured into a Trappiste glass.  This classic is always a treat.  It pours river water brown with a modest thin head that settles quickly.  The aroma is nicely balanced with dates, apricots and brown sugar.  There is a subtle but enjoyable fermenting fruit alcohol bite in the nose as well.  The dates translate to raisins when you taste the beer.  There are light wood tones, faint traces of banana and sweet malts as well.  The finish is cloying and warming and lets you know youve been drinking a beer and not summer ade.
"
1," Bottle 0.33 l (bb 2010). Hazy beige yellow with bigger particles falling to bottom of glass. Nose is a bit clayish, grassy, sharp and yeasty. Flavor is bitter, spicy and a bit weizenlike. Mostly just stingy bitter. Strangely unattractive and sparkly. Supposed to be served cold, but turned out to be much more pleasant after warming a bit. Sour, sparkly and bitter, cant say I enjoyed enormously.
"
1," Just like the rest of the world states...not as good as the Blue.  Very similar IMHO though.  Less carbonated then the Blue which I am not sure is good or bad.  The flavors of the red are toned down a little from the Blue.  I liked this Chimay a lot though.
"
1," There are so many reviews of this beer, what is there to add?  Chimay Blue is so classic its almost cliche.  Great beer.
"
1," On tap at Big River  Chattanooga.  Poured clear lighter caramel with a short cap of off-white head.  The aroma picked up candy-like sweetness with lighter fruits and grapefruit represented.. not too good, but somewhat intriguing.. seemed stronger than it actually was.  The flavor found sweet grapefruit and lighter other fruits accented by pine and grapefruit bitterness on the edges.. a bit sharp at times, and not very well-balanced.  Grainy and very sweet on the palate.. moderate carbonation left some sharper boozy notes on the finish.
"
1," JUL 24, 2009 The best chimay makes, flavor is better than the blue , in my opinion. Seven percent abv is unnoticeable. This beer goes with any dinner or by itself is a great beer.
"
1," (swing top bottle) Clear golden colour with a medium foamy white head. Aromatic nose of malts and floral hops with a touch of citrus and cake dough. Medium sweet flavour, medium body. Initially bready malty taste with a lasting smooth hopbitter finish. Nice.

1," pours opaque brick red with a bubbly head. aroma is raisiny and and nutty. flavor is bright and fruity, stone fruits and berries. buttery and malty finish. a fine dubbel is ever there was one.
"
1," Wonderful beer, Very solid, but probably my least favorite of the Chimay beers. Still has great taste and body. The last sip from the last glass is just as tasty as the first one.
"
1," JAN 3, 2008 Pours in color very much like pomegranate juice. Rocky, froth head that stays well. Alcohol, grapes, wet wood, malts come through in the nose to. Flavor is alcohol sweet up front and a light, pleasant fruity sweetness in the finish. Much lighter than I was expecting on the palate which, to me, is a great surprise. So many of these overwhelm with an alcohol  bitterness. Its a great beer. No hiding or covering anything up here. Just damn good stuff.

1," One of my very favorite beers. Beautiful red color, not much of a head. Complex aroma reminiscent of dark fruits, somewhat peppery. Flavor is the same, malty, tremendous estery character provided by the Chimay yeasts. Hop flavor barely evident, the malts and candi sugar dominate.
"
1," Draught@brewpub (Portland, OR)	This is an oak-aged version of their Hanso Stout. Dark, almost opaque black color, small beige head. Coffee, caramel, licorice. Light to medium bodied. Funny papery licorice powder flavor. This is an oak-aged beer but has only a tiny amount of woody flavor. Palate is watery, much more than 6.4% indicates.
"
1," Big River Disney World-Sweet Magnolia Brown Ale(Gordon Biersch)-on tap-pours a light tan head that laces.  Color is deep amber/brown.  Aroma is malt.  Taste is deep malt, roasty, sweet.
"
1," 330 ml bottle from a trade with hogtownharry. thx harry ive wanted this one for a long time. pours beautiful dark brown with a big tan head. just the way youd expect a big dark belgian to look. aromas are amazingly complex. sweetness, yeast, dark fruit medly, rich maltiness. yum. the flavour cant quite live up to the aroma but is still amazing. a very enjoyable brew. thanks again harry.
"
1," Weak date and yeast aroma. Brown color, thin head, full of sediment. Phenolic flavor of dates. Caramel appears during warming. Decent hop finish. Harsh mouthfeel, underachieving sample of a trappist ale. What a drag.
"
1," 750ml bottle. Pours a lightly fizzy brown color with a small white head. Nose is nuts and caramel, light belgian funk and a yeasty doughy scent. Taste is more of the funky and dough notes, some light sweet malt and caramel. palate is lightly playful and fizzy.
"
1," cranberries?
"
1," deep rich brown body.  Fairly cloudy.  Dark spices with hints of ripe fruits.  great roasted nuttiness.  Hints of yeast in there as well.  Holy moly man! this is something of everything that is beer.  great stuff.
"
1," Malzig-wrziger Antrunk, mitelintensiv. Die Aromen bleiben, wirken im Mittelteil aber etwas verwssert. Eine herbe Malzigkeit ist nun vorherrschend und verstrkt sich im Abgang. Hier nur wenig herber und kaum wrzig. Mildes Festbier. 9/8/9/8/9/8
"
1," For beer number 300- I went back to a beer I havent had for awhile. I used to order this at the Dubliner in Omahas Old Market district. The Dubliner was an Irish style cellar pub with a Blarney Stone (every St. Paddys Day youd see inebriated revelers drunkely embracing and smooching it) at the top of the stairs leading to street level, traditional Irish music and an Irish board of fare. 20 years ago, the Dubliner was my preferred bar in Omaha so I revisited this brew to see if was still the way I remembered it.	The aroma is sweet-plums, pears, yeast with a hint of rose or  maybe lilac-Im not sure cant really pin it down.	It has a moderate sweetness with carmelized fruit notes and the alcohol lights you up without a noticeable taste. Velvety mouthfeel and delicate carbonation.	A very fine complex beer (why did I wait 20 years to drink this?)-maybe Ill start bringing it when I tailgate at Arrowhead.	GO CHIEFS!-(see Im an optimist).
"
1," Bottle. Pours clear caramel amber. White head. Nose/taste of sweet malt, caramel and hops. Light pine finish. Medium body.
"
1," Thanks to my brother-in-law for brining this back for me. Clear bright copper amber, moderate off-white head. Sweet caramel and apple juice aroma. Sweet grainy palate, some caramel, faint nutty quality, low hop content (tea leaves). On the thin side.
"
1," I love the beer! It's aroma and taste both remind me fruit and spice. I could make a night of drinking just this one!
"
1," brown pour with ruby highlights, light offwhite head.  aroma is of dark malts, raisins, chocolate, roast, cinnamon, and some light fruitiness.  sublte notes of toasted malt, plum, chocolate, some light nut, nice boozy sweetness.  warming.   mouth feel is medium with significant  effervescence.  truly a delight.
"
1," Bottled. Golden coloured.  Malty aroma. Mild malty flavour with some sweetness. Quite pleasant and soft.
"
1," Bottle.  Pours with a creamy/fluffy light tan head.  Murky, dark brown hue. Prunes and some candied sugar at first in the aroma.  Faint bit of alcohol and spice as well.  Not nearly as sweet as I remembered other samples, dark fruitiness dominates, some light sweetness at the end.  Prunes feature along with some toffee.  Medium body with vibrant carbonation, warming at the back of the throat.  Classic brew, and luckily its pretty readily available in a lot of places.
"
1," Bottle 50cl, a clear yellow beer with low head. nose has lemony notes ! What an horrible beer, just water with intense bitterness and dusty hops, just undrinkable.
"
1," This brew poured a large head of fine to medium sized off white mostly lasting bubbles that left a fair lacing and a uncarbonated hazy light brown colored body behind.  It had a medium strength malt hop aroma and a smooth thin malt flavor in a somewhat thin mouthfeel.
"
1," A deep brown color, cloudy, and a small white head.  Cant see through this one at all!  There are grapes and raisins in the aroma, and sweet malt. Flavour is also fruity but a bit of caramel and peanuts as well and alcohol is apparent.  Its smooth but not necessarily creamy but approaching that point.
"
1," Tasted 8/11/10. Sampler from the Brewpub. Hazy with a golden hue. Aromas of citrus and cereal grains. Mild and light bodied. Simple and straight forward. The finish is a mix of sweet wheaty malts and mild pepper.

1,"//www.ratebeer.com/Place/indiana/highlan Liquor Stop, Highland, IN and shared at a small meeting of the <a href=http"
1," Thick, fizzy, and long lasting head.  Looks like a merangue.  Pours a cloudy, dark brown with an aroma of bananas, apricots, peaches, and sweet bread with a hint of carmel.  Full-flavored and mellow at the same time.  Goes down smooth after a quick fizz on top of my tongue.  malty finish.  Irie Dub.
"
1," Bottle pours a dark brown, almost black, large foamy off-white head, strong carbonation, with hardly any lacing.  HUGE Bourbon aroma, with hints of molasses, raisins, and oddly enough, Tang.  Fairly heavy Bourbon up front, but it slowly turns into a nice roasted malt flavor.  However, that then subsides and you get more of a vanilla bourbon flavor on the finish.  Okay body, but a tad thin on the mouthfeel.  Could stand to be a bit heavier, but good nonetheless.  Thanks goes out to atpayne for the trade! 
"
1," A very overrated beer. It has a great color and texture, but the taste is very lacking. I think I was unimpressed mainly because it is so hyped. I will try the Bleu and see how overrated it is.
"
1," sweet, light yeasty, light alcoholic, no particular finish. Medium body, the alcohol is felt.
"
1," Aroma is malty, sweet, thick. Taste is the same, not as much yeast as expected from a trappist beer but very balanced indeed.
"
1," TheDM and Hotstuff vacation brew 10.  This draft brew was enjoyed at the Big River Brewery in Chattanooga Tennessee which was hosted by a pleasant accomodating staff.  The manager paid for our samples and even bought us appetizers to help clear our palates.  This brew poured a medium sized head of fine to medium sized off-white colored bubbles that left behind a fair lace and a transparent red brown colored uncarbonated body.  It had a strong IPA like biting mouthfeel, a mild hop  aroma and the flavor was all hops.
"
1," APR 24, 2007 Pint at the Seven Bridges Brewpub in Jacksonville, a big party for the arrival of the Oktoberfest with some of the proceeds going to charity. This years brew was excellent.  Pours clear dark amber, with a nice big white head that slowly diminishes. Light aroma of sweet malt.  Flavor has caramel and malt and a slight sharp bite from the alcohol and carbonation and hops.  Very well balanced and drinkable.  A solid session brew.
"
1," Chimay red is such a great treat.  Yeasty rich aroma, followed by a warming alcohol presence, make this a classic cocktail.  Try it with paper thin slices of imported Reggio Parmesana cheese. 	Chimay is health food.
"
1," Pours dark, dark brown and murky with a modest off white head.  Yeasty aroma - similar to the Red.  Banana, sweet syrup, roasted malt.  Full bodied.  Mild, but long finish.  Easily paired with a Punch, Cohiba, or other spicy cigar - or food, if youre into that.
"
1," Thanks tytoanderso.  The color was dark chocolate/black.  The aroma was coffee, espresso. chocolate, and roasty malt.  The flavor was strong coffee, some hops, and roast.  The palate was average.  The finish was roasty.
"
1," PSSSSSSSH! Wow, a bit too carbonated, this one! A gusher, and I have to clean my living room table before continuing the rating. The gushing caused the dark amber brownish body to end up very hazy, almost cloudy. The medium-sized off-white head is quite long-lived, and laces the glass very well. A bit faint, moderate sweet malty aroma with noticeable hoppy and yeasty notes. I get caramel, yeast, fruit, honey and spices. Medium sweet and light to medium bitter taste with a long-lasting yeasty dry finish. Flavours are yeast, fruits, honey, spices, caramel and alcohol. Good mouthfeel, but it actually feels a bit thinner that Id expected from an abbey dubbel. Still a very nice beer, may I have another, please? 	[33 cl bottle, from Vinmonopolet Storo, Oslo]
"
1," Bottle thanks to thirdeye11. Pours a dark brown color with a light tan head. Nose is ammonia, herbs, and dusty gravel. Taste is slightly more sweet version of these things. Thick sauce, I think it says?
"
1," Not as good as Chimay Bleu, but the Rouge version is also a wonderful abbey ale.  Beautiful to smell and taste, the big bottle is great for sharing.
"
1," Bottle, bought @ YNWA, Kolding.	Deep chestnut brown with a small, creamy, beige head. Stays as a thin film. Aroma has light metal, some dark chocolate and roasted malts. Highish carbonation, a bit thin mouthfeel. Flavour is mildly roasted, some limited chocolate. Good, long aftertaste with light piney hops and roasted malts.
"
1," Not a bad beer but not a great IPA either. The hops are there full force on the nose. The palate and mouthfeel just dont feel quite right. I didnt like the balance and found myself wanting a different beer while drinking this.
"
1," (bottle) Clear, golden colour with a big and quite persistent slightly off-white foamy head. Sweet malty biscuity nose with a touch of marzipan and subtle fruity accents. Sweet flavour, medium to full body with a smooth carbonation. Strong pale and Pilsener-malt character, a bit cookie-like with a moderate residual sweetness and faint fruity compounds; sweet malty finish with a whiff of balancing hoppy bitterness. Not a great achievement but a pleasant to drink pale Doppelbock.
"
1,"  poured a amber brown with off-white bubbles, dark malt, some fruit and cola fragrances, faint caramel aroma, dark malt flavor with some spices, a lot of carbonation on the tongue which makes this ale real light on the palate, faint pepper or hop bite in the finish, light on the palate,	with all of the talk about this ale I was expecting a little more.
"
1," Purplish brown with a medium brown head.  Aroma of coffee, roasted malts, cocoa and sour milk.  Taste is malty and sour with a mild coffee aftertaste. A so-so effort at best.
"
1," Bottle from Sainsburys. Dark brown colour, beige head. Aroma is roasted malts and chocolate. Light flavour of roasted malts, chocolate, maybe dark fruits. Watery.
"
1," Big Rivers attempt at a light pale lager is just that...a light pale lager.  Little taste, no body.  Need not drink.
"
1," Absolute the best of Chimay, a dark brown colour, with a good foam. Big aroma of dried fruit and hints of tobacco. Taste wonderfull, and have a good balance with malt and bitterness, and the alcohol are good hidden. Also try to store some bottle for 5 years, then this beer taste amazing......
"
1," Tasted 04/07/2005.  500ml bottle from Rumbles, Wellington.	Murky ruby, still, with a pocketed, collapsing, lacey, light tan head.  Plums and prunes on the nose at first, followed by wood and smoke.  Flavour is sweet and smokey up front with a strong tea-like astringency through the middle.  Some woody hop notes in the background.  Quite velvety mouthfeel, low carbonation and a dry finish.  More a wee heavy than a pale ale, in fact its almost false advertising.  I can, however, certainly imagine 19th century beer tasting like this....
"
1," (1pt 9.4oz) poured into a Chimay Tulip (short)  pours a dark cloudy amber with some carbonation present.  has a full frothy head that slowly receded leaving the film that is to be expected.  Aroma is of a belgium trappist, YEAST.  some fruits present, bannana fromt the yeast.  taste is smooth with some tingle on the front from the carboanation, a mild middle, with a yeasty and fruity bannana finish.  has a good aftertaste of the yeast.  more mild than the other trappists, but obviously still very good.  I dont know, but if you talk to long time drinkers of Chimay, they say that it has lost some of its quality over the years.  probably the most ""commercial"" trappist.  always a good drink, and you have to scrutinize the trappists because they all are very good, and are held at a different level.
"
1," FEB 23, 2003 8/8/02"
1," A pretty standard porter. Aroma was faint with some coffee and nutmeg detectable. Appearance was black with a generous head a good lacing effect. Flavor was fairly weak with coffee and chocolate and a little spice to make it slightly different than other porters Ive had. Mouthfeel was a little thin. Not a bad beer but not a great one either.
"
1," dark fruits, roast, toffee, nuts, cherry, tobacco, leather. I dont care if I cant tell them apart without thinking really hard, I dont care how alike they are or anything else--these big bad BSAs are one of the great pleasures in the beer world. But, then, I do like me my sugar, so there ya go.
"
1," Tap @ Coalition. Hazy orange pour with a brief, minimal white head leaving coarse lace. Pine, grapefruit and malt nose. Medium body and moderate, very fine carbonation yielding a somewhat creamy mouth feel. Grapefruit, tea, biscuit, cereal and a light sucrose sweetness. Finish is long and bitter, with more citrus rind and cereal. Bettered by several other of Coalitions offerings.
"
1," Bottle, thanks pivnizub. Golden, fine carbonation, gigantic creamy head. Light cracker-malt body, light fruityness like a berry jelly in the middle, good grassy, light metallic hop profile. Light sulphury note retronasal.
"
1," Cloudy dark bronw beer topped by a thin off-white head. Pretty strange roasty nose reminds me of burnt buckwheat galettes which is not a particularly pleasant smell, but reminds of fond memories and hits the spot. Besides that, it stays focused on rather sweet, biscuit meets toffee sugary malts. Fortunately, the carbonation does the necessary cleansing job to reduce the sugary feel from that surprisingly frail body	. Far from perfect, but still one of my favourite Slovenian dunkels from possibly my favourite brewer in the country.
"
1," medium head, red brown rich colour. balanced flavour, just the right amount of hopiness. smoothest trappist ive had. fairly carbinated. very mellow.
"
1," On tap at the brewpub. Dark brown color with no head.  Aroma and taste of coffee and chocolate, really dark for a amber ale.
"
1," (750ml bottle) Pours rather deeper in colour than the average cider - appears to be an orange-amber like you would find with an English Bitter. No carbonation yet it has very tiny sedimentation everywhere. The cider carries a very pleasant and sweet nose of MacIntosh apples and a white wine undertone. The flavour is extrordinary - a good balance of sweet, tart and alcohol with a spiciness to boot. A tad dry and thin for my liking but a very good cider all-round. Very enjoyable for a cider prices as agreeably as this one - $12.95. Would go nicely with a chicken or lamb dish.
"
1," Can.  Hellbilly.  amber pour, frothy head.  Aroma has biscuits, bready notes, earthy hops.  Flavor is maltier than hoppy.  Crackers, light dusty hops.  Meh.
"
1," 33cl, from De Hopduvel Gent, complex, yet easy to drink Trappist, cloudy, rocky head, good brew
"
1," Not a big fan of wheat beers.  Exception is Gumballhead but thats because it is over-hopped into an IPAish wheat beer.  This didnt have that advantage.  Golden body with small white head gave off aroma of breakfast cereal and orange juice.  Weak and watery and totally forgettable.
"
1," One of my favorites. Very nice dark color with a decent head. Gets better every taste. Especially the last part of the glass is fantastic. Its not too sweet, not to bitter, not too fruity. Just a perfect strong ale with just the right amount of alcohol.
"
1," Pours a deep brown color with a large white head.  Aroma is yeasty and malty.  Flavor is very much the same with a bit of fruityness to it.
"
1," This beer poured a medium sized off-white head that consisted of fine-small bubbles.The body was clear with no carbonation.The hue was orange and there was only a fair amount of lacing.The nose was malty and also of apples.The flavor was bitter, hoppy and it left an aftertaste.The mouthfeel was smooth.
"
1," MAR 8, 2005 Pours dark brown with a good sized tan head. Flavor is spicy with hardly any alcohol taste in it. This stuff makes your tongue tingle in a good way. I love it.
"
1," A good and beautiful trappist beer, but a little too bitter and sparkly for my taste. You can taste the alc in the afterburn, but the taste itself is great with malt, caramel and sweet herbes. Overall a good Belgian ale.
"
1," I've been impressed with Big River beers so far and this is no exception. Granted this beer is not as good as Spaten or Paulaner Oktoberfests but it's still quite good. Dark amber appearance. Flavor is a little carbonated with a heavy malt profile and a slight bitterness. Faint fruit flavors are present. Another good brew from Big River although I do prefer many of thier others to this style.
"
1," Bottle 330ml.Clear medium yellow color with a large, frothy to creamy, good lacing, mostly lasting, white to off-white head. Aroma is moderate malty, grain, toasted, light to moderate hoppy, grass. Flavor is moderate sweet and bitter with a average duration. Body is medium, texture is oily, carbonation is soft. [20100613]
"
1," Bottle. [Tasting session @ Papsoe] Huge thick creamy off-white head that really lasted. Excellent display of lacework. Cloudy orange-golden color with particles in flow. Aroma of wheat, citrus, fruity, yeast. Over the palate came spice, grain, floral notes. Medium bodied with an average carbonation and dry texture. Moderated bitter and sweet flavour in balance. Nice dry light bitter finish. Quite nice!
"
1," Dark red appearance.  Nose is of smoked malt and somehow a touch of fruit.  Body is nicely smoked with an oily mouthfeel.  Touches of roast are also prevalent.  Good amount of alcohol, but overall comes up a bit light.  Nice smoked beer nonetheless.
"
1," Bottle. Pours a light golden with a frothy white head. The taste is a smooth malt, decent hops and something else, maybe citrus. Not bad.
"
1," I sorry guys your IPA won me over, but this did not.  The sweet taste just does not fit this beer.  It hits your taste buds at a weird time while drinking it.  I will stick with the IPA.  I still need to try certified evil, I really looking forward to it.
"
1," Looks good but to me, lacks flavor. The finish is short lived but sure is nice to pound back on a hot day.
"
1," Tap @ The Portland Art Museums Shine A Light...  Poured golden/orange with a white head.  Clean, dry, light palate.  Hops played a lot of citrus with some piney-ness.  Mildew, cracker malts, and a big hop finish.

"
1," JUN 24, 2007 red brown with creamy white head. Like the other chimays it has a lively carbonation. Defenetly a bit like the bleu but not as complex. It feels like a  little bit less of everything. Ok finish!  Re-rating june 07"
1," JAN 7, 2006 amber/copper amber color; thick head and lacing - heavy carbonation.  The taste seems to start off sweet and fruity and ends with  bitterness (coffee and nuts are evident as is banana).
"
1," Pours a dark brown with a medium, but well-retained light tan head.  Big dark fruity aroma, dark malts, some candy sugar.  Nice, mlaty, fruity flavors.  Nice carbonation, not too much, not too little.  There definitely is some candy sugar in there, but not as much as their other offerings.  The dark fruits really are the dominant flavor throughout this beer.  Sweet, long finish.  The aftertaste is fruity and sweet as well.  Very good.
"
1," Great stuff.  Rich brown-red color.  Very inviting, fruity scent.  A nice, hoppy brew, with plenty of grapefruit in the taste.  Nicely balanced malts.  Pleasingly creamy, with good, fizzy carbonation and a dry finish.  Eminently quaffable.
"
1," GTMW 08 on cask - Pours bronze orang with a minimal head.  The aroma has lots of vanilla and some bourbon and toasty malt.  Medium sticky body with light carbonation.  The flavor starts with the aroma traits with more caramel malt and earthy hops.  The finish has vanilla and okay dominating everything.  This kind of beer is just not down my alley.
"
1," (bottle, from pivnizub) Clear, pale golden with a foamy blonde medium-sized head. Sweet grainy aroma with a touch of hay and herbal, slightly grassy hoppy notes. Soft malty, slightly grainy initial taste with a upcoming herbal hoppy taste, leading to a dry herbal hoppy finish, light to medium bodied with a smooth carbonation. A Helles, which is rather on the hoppy side. Not bad.
"
1," I think this ale is very overrated. Although better than the white or red (I tried them all vertically), this one would be the best. I love malty ales and the sweetness was great. Makes an excellent presentation.
"
1," Jumpin Jehosophat, what a beer!  Thanks for the gift pack Bill C.  Bottle to Trappist glass.  Pours dark mahogany with a large beige head.  Really wonderful complex aroma, with many sweet and spicy notes.  Taste is malty sweet with toffee and black licorice.  Well balanced palate that is nearly chewy, but gives way at the right point.  Just a tad bit of hops in the finish.  It will also kick your ass.  Now I know what the deal is, God smiles on monks and makes their beer good.

1," good stuff.

"
1," bottle from the Morag hostel bar in St. Augustus - Pours near black and smells of roasted malt and coffee.  The flavor is much the same with the coffee playing a fairly minor role.  Its medium bodied and overall fairly average.
"
1," Large, dirty white colored head w/ an amber body. Nice smooth taste, its alcohol level sneaks up on you.
"
1,"  	Tantalizing candied grapefruit meld into honeyed malts, aided by the pillowy nitrogen-induced mouthfeel, before delving into a levelled spicy, green hop bitterness. 		Further Personal Perceptions "
1," Floral hoppy, good and dry, with pronounced bitterness. Reddish, then Very lacy. An average beer but certainly Decent for its style. More of an American red ale
"
1," But a shadow of its former self. After the recipe was changed in 2001 to use wheat starch and hop extract this beer has lost the wonderful complexity it has been known for.
"
1," Nice dark brown color with thick cream and tan head.  Besides the expected dry fruit and malt aroma, their was a hint of brightness, floral or raspberry, and little overt alcohol taste.  Well balanced flavor, smooth with a sweet finish that seemed unbeerlike, but enjoyable.  Happy to serve again.
"
1," Bottle @ Southern/Western Denmark Tasting, Ulfborg. Pours cloudy yellow with a small off white head. Hoppy and hayish flavor. Dry and crisp. Clean. Medium bodied. Dry end.
"
1," nice, big and hoppy. funny that this is explicitly made for beer geeks (so it says on the beer menu). interesting? maybe not but straight forward beer goodness. bushy and light carmel sweetness. beauty.
"
1," Dark amber appearance, with a thick, but airy, head.  The aroma is mildly apricot/caramel, but only mildly.  Every sip is like champagne -- lots of tiny bubbles conspire to tickle your nose.  Its flavor is light and, surprisingly, slightly toward the bitter end of the spectrum.  Its got some mild fruity flavor and a finish that sort of renews the flavor.  In other words, just as the flavor is fading, the finish kicks in to keep it going, but slightly more bitterly than the original flavor.  A great beer thats worth the trouble.
"
1," sweet malt with fruity notes, later becoming dry with light hop bitterness. Very nicely balanced. A very satisfying abbey dubbel on par with Westmalle.
"
1," Bottle. No yeast in the bottom. Golden colour with a weak head. Hoppy aroma with also a hoppy flavour with notes of malt. But overall very dull and uninteresting lager.
"
1," sample @ the pub, thin beer, no fruit flavour at all the presentation and all with the blueberry in the glass was exciting at first but the taste breaks it all.

1," Clear yellow with a fizzy white head. Multigrain bread aroma and a malty doughy taste with a smooth vanilla finish. Really good for the style.
"
1," SEP 11, 2008 The taste is just pleasant...caramel, some fruity notes, not overly complicated. Sweet but not too sweet. Its nicely carbonated, like fizzy bubbly champagne tickling your tongue. Surprisingly easy drinking.
"
1," starter kit for chimay, great belgian dubbel. smells of dried fruits, brown sugar and malts. sweet and malty with hints of dry fruit (raisins and prunes) also some caramel, kinda yeasty too. good stuff, but as most know and agree... the blue and white are better.
"
1," this was a pretty good IPA, although i not really sure if it is truly a micro or not.  Has a nice hop aroma as well as taste and a good bitter finish.
"
1," Has a cider look and a wheat smell.  Taste is wheaty, but slightly bitter and finishes with an alcohol like flavor.  Overall not bad, but not my favorite.  I dont like the alcohol aftertaste that it has.
"
1," Bottle as a rare find in TN for a new state!  Pours a deep amber/almost copper.  A few bubbles float around on the surface, little carbonation.  Aromas are English IPA-like... lots of caramel malt, herbal hops, a little resin and spice.  Flavor is similar... I like the West Coast-style IPA description, but this is more of a hybrid between West Coast and England.  Flavor is OK... but again, its more herbal and spicy hops instead of citrus and resin.  Its good, but not quite as advertised.
"
1," JAN 3, 2010 Poured from 750, kind of a dirt brown with smallish tan head that disappeared quickly.  Nose of fruit, seemed highly carbonated.  The taste was a blend of fruits, malts, spices, finishing off very dry. The alcohol is decieving, sneaking up on you.
"
1," Bottle @ Paps. Thanks. Pours unclear amber with a small creamy head and lacings. Nose is quite vinous with notes of caramel and fruit. Flavor is tart and fruity with brett and a bit of caramel.
"
1," I recently tried a Chimay for the first time, a 2007 I think of the blue and found it to be miles different from a 2006 I tried later, so I am thinking the same that the bottle of red I tried may have also been a little young. Lots of fizz out of the bottle but seemed to lose the head very quickly indeed and it evaporated to nothing. A great deal of aroma, very fruity and sweet but like the young blue it just seemed to me that it was more fizz on the tongue which seemed to lead onto not a great deal
"
1," Bought this highly touted Belgian in a 0,33 cl bottle. Pours to a nice off white head that was long lasting. Appearance of the beer was dark brown to almost burnt orange. Flavour was yeasty and fruity -- not too bitter, nor was it too sweet. Finish was yeasty and short. Not a bad beer, but I was quite disappointed given its reputation.
"
1," The dunkel seems to use the same yeast (a standard house yeast which is taken from the Radeberger Brewery) as the pils.  The first time I was there it was a dark red color, which was a brilliant garnet when held up to a candle.  Again, it also displayed a malty sweetness with a bit of diacetyl, but without the assertive hop bitterness of the pils.  At other times it can be not quite as clear but the flavor is much the same if not just a bit sharper.
"
1," Bottle 50 cl. Courtesy of fonefan. Pours a clear golden with a slight haze. Malts and sulphur in the nose. Medium body, good clean malts. Dry, sulphurous finish. 280111
"
1," On tap at Big River  Chattanooga.  Poured clear bright golden with a light dusting of white head.  The aroma was light and sweet with bready and honey notes.. just a little dusty floral as an accent.  The flavor wasnt so hot.. cardboard joined honey and pale malt sweetness at the core.. weak and watery with not much going on.  Light-bodied with too much carbonation and a dry finish.  Drinkable, but meh.
"
1," holy cow is this a great beer.  i am usually not a fan of belgain style beers, but this is just awesome.  great hoppy/yeasty aroma, really well balanced.  super smooth and drinkable.  if i had to find a fault, it would be that it was a little too carbonated, but thats just picking nits.
"
1," (On tap) Nashville. Very pale pilsener golden with a creamy, white head. Rather light aroma of malt. Very light body, vague notes of malt - and then what seems to be a typical American brew pub twist - a nasty tang of mold. No hops. 290306

1," Twist-off. Pours translucent dark gold. Smoothish, fluffy head that sticks nicely. A whiff of skunk in the nose--unusual for an IPA--complemented by something a bit unappetizing, arguably gueuze-like. Pretty hard carbonation. Not exactly the hop bitters you want--more like alcohol bitters. This definitely drinks hotter than 6.3%. Actually a pretty sweet beer. Not my style of IPA.
"
1," two finger white head atop a hazy brown. tastes of pears, grapes and hops. this is very carbonated a bit of lacing here and there. this is a very good beer and would reccommend this to anyone who can afford it.
"
1," (bottle) Clear, reddish amber colour with a medium-sized, beige foamy head. Sweet and moderately toasted malty aroma with a touch of caramel, sour-dough and earthy hoppy notes. Sweet flavour with a sourish, subtle fruity touch, Slightly toasted malty and leafy taste with shy notes of caramel and some herbal accents; medium to light bodied with a soft carbonation; sweet and slightly bitter toasty malty finish with traces of herbal hops. Average Dunkel.
"
1," This one pours a ruddy bronze color with a deep haze, ample white head and considerable lace. The main thrust of the head dissipates quickly leavy a wispy white covering.		There is a sweetness to the nose, which is nevertheless faint and also redolent of ripe fruit and complex spiciness.		Mouthfeel is fulll, creamy and carbonated. Strong malts attack the taste buds and fill the palate, and then quickly balanced by a mixture of hops, and a yeasty presence of fruity complexity.		A classic Trappist, popular for all the right reasons.
"
1," Fruity and malty.  One of the only Dubbels Ive had, so Im not sure how it fits into the style.  Not as good as the white and blue, in my opinion.
"
1," thick caramel brown color.  mine was very carbonated, but not much head at all.  nice slightly bitter taste, some fuity sweetness.  overall, very good.
"
1," very hoppy, slightly bitter.  has a faint floral aroma, and is darker than most typical pale ales.
"
1," As it sets in the glass an unblurred mahogany color, the head is modest in size, frothy in its texture and a winsome light tan in color as it vanishes quite quickly a patchy sheet of rather thick lace remains to protect the glass. Sweet malt is dominate, crisp fresh and clean with a vanilla and nut like tones also present, begins malt sweet with the top light to medium in feel. Finish has a mild carbonation, hops unassuming in their spiciness, dry and lingering aftertaste, also noticed a bit of burnt grain in the aftertaste, a drinkable beer. Interesting name must look up and see what history lies behind that name, always a point of interest with me.
"
1," 750 ml bottle Wonderful fragrance, floral and spicy. A delicate thick golden-brown with a thin line of white foam at the edges. Taste is sweet at first, candied fruit with a decent tinge of bitterness. This beer's reputation precedes it, and it doesn't disappoint.
"
1," 12oz wax dipped via trade with my main man mike, BBB63.  Thanks dude.  Didnt realize it was a big beer like this till I looked at the 10% listed here, guess Im starting the night of with a bang.  Pours brownish black with a tan head.  Nose is sweet and quite boozy with a kick in the nostrils.  Taste is sweet and viscous and very fruity.  Also pretty bold and boozy, pretty cool strong dark belgian.
"
1," malt, raisins, cloved and a long bittter aftertaste. Very good.
"
1," Excellent bire. Aucune autre bire ne rivalise avec celle la. Je vous la conseille.
"
1," Cask Stillage at the Town Hall, Stockport 29/05/2003	Dark colour smooth on the palate. Some wheat flavour hops and fruit. Slightly bitter lasting finish.
"
1," I strongly suspected this beer was snazzy marketing from a shifty deep pockets startup or a macro brewer in disguise--which it may be.		This beer is a wonderful rich mouthfeel and equally balanced hop attack of a mild astringent, citrus, and light fruit. The hops are strong and balanced. It is very good, a well done beer with a nice deep color. 		I strongly suggest picking up a sixer. BUT, dont confuse the IPA and the Lager (green vs. orange pkg.) The lager is almost undrinkable. Just awful.
"
1," Dark, rich garnet brown with a thin head, light menthol aroma, thin and fizzy with a bit of chocolate, faint coffee maltiness and mint. About as much hop as a dead frog, disappointing dry finish... its not easy being green!
"
1," Great seasonal brew, dark brown in color, soft white head, very well balanced, hints of different spices in the flavors like nutmeg & cinammon, a bit of a dry finish, very nice seasonal
"
1, Rouge (Red)	Date
1," Light wheat-bock aroma. Bit fruity, sweet. Light hops presence. Dark caramel-red cloudy with off-white foamy lacing head. Med body & med-heavy carb. Nice belgian taste. Sweet & malty up front with wheat-yeast fruity finish. Light hops & bitter after. Very enjoyable.
"
1," FEB 25, 2011 courtesy of oteyj. pours a dark walnut color with a steady, slow to die head, really persistent carbonation. aroma has a lot of dark fruit, grape, sweetness. flavor is incredible- very sweet, but the complexity is so subtle that it remains so smooth. delicious aftertaste makes you want to take the next sip so the taste never leaves your tongue.
"
1," Cloudy dark brown pour.  Small head.  Good spicy and yeast nose.  Rich malts,  sweet, yeast, little alcohol, some fruity undertones.  Dry finish.  Overall, impressive.
"
1," Bottle from Landbierparadies, Nurnberg 9/11/07. Chestnut coloured with a slight, off-white head. Doughy caramel and cinnamon aroma. Sweet malt aroma with a dryish finish. Good.
"
1," Bottle -- Pours with a fairly dense beige head with a bit of retention and quite good lacing. A murky brown with very active, very fine bubbles. Aroma is alcohol and over-ripe fruit. Round palate with perhaps a little harshness -- a little electric like somone else said. Flavour is quite sweet with fruit cake and some caramel, with an aftertaste of alcohol. Even though the alcohol content isnt that high, I find it gives the beer more of a ""bite"" than that lovely alcohol warmth you get with Chimay Blue. A wonderful beer just the same.
"
1," Draft at Lake Buena Vista location.  Poured ruby brownish with nose of caramel malt, hop, pine, peppery notes.  Tastes very resiny hoppy, with fruity and peppery finishing notes.  Good.
"
1," Aromas of floral hops, hay, straw and cassis. Pours a hazy reddish brown with an off-white head that is quickly diminishing.  Initial flavor is a bright hop bitterness with a hint of malt sweetness that opens to a spicy flavor that reminds me of flank steak grilled on a flat top. Finishes with a nice well balanced hop bitterness. Will try this with grilled beef next time.
"
1," Umm a sonny evening in the garden accomplished by a red Chimay, not too bad. The color is hazy amber with a rather large light brownish head. The form is kind a large bobbled so it vanished in a few minutes. The aroma is sweet malty and the taste fills the mouth with distinct malt.
"
1," My favourite Trappist beer so far. Has a great aroma and a spicy and caramel like taste.
"
1," Caramel malts all the way through with a bit of bitterness at the end.  Very carbonated and quite good.  Inferior to the white though.  Very smooth.		330ml into trappist glass.
"
1," wow nice ruby amber color with a small head.  nice dried fruit smell with some malts mixed in.  very thin despite the darker color on the pour.
"
1," a good solid triple......still has that weird chimay yeast that I am not fond of....but balanced and good besides that...
"
1," 25.6 oz ""bomber"" bottle with a cork dated 03/07.  Pours a dark brown iced tea-ish color with an of-white version of the standard huge belgian head.  As the top of the head begins to diminish the hundreds of tiny bubbles rising in the tulip glass to the bottom of the head replace what vanishes.  The aroma is of malt & dark fruits.  The flavor is a dry malty fruitiness with a fizzy medium bodided mouthfeel.  Alcohol becomes more noticeable as it warms up, but its not overpowering.  Great beer, just a great beer.  If you see it, buy it!!!
"
1," [Bottle] Pours deep amber with a small off-white head. Aroma is lemony, with some pine--not bad. The taste has an unusual spiciness, with some lemon zest, moderate bitterness, and barley in the finish. Decent mouthfeel, finish length is average to slightly below. An interesting IPA. Fairly well made, although the taste reminded me a little of the pink filling in some of the chocolates you find in the assorted chocolate packs around Valentines Day. Actually, all around my biggest complaint with this beer isnt execution, but just rather how the hops ended up playing out. Still, it seems like this brewery could turn out some good beer, so I look forward to trying their other offerings.
"
1," SEP 8, 2009 I have had this one a number of times and really can not say why it has taken me this long to get around to rating it.  Sampled this time from an 11.2 oz brown bottle this brew poured a murky brown color with a faint reddish tinge and a huge creamy beige head.  There is a tart, sweet fruity hop aroma with light sour malt undertones, a touch of mustiness and a hint of cherry nutmeg and caramel. The flavor was tart, bitter and had light touches of fruity and floral hops, cherry, sugar, caramel and a faint musty undertone. The finish was long, sour, tart and fruity. Fairly full bodied. Very well done.
"
1," MAY 4, 2008 bottle poured into the chimay trappist glass that came in the boxed set. color is a brown with loads of sediment floating around and a nice head on the pour taming back to a thin layer. aroma has spicy yeast, sweet caramel, malt, and some over ripe banana. mouth feel is medium with a very smooth texture. flavor has a great yeasty spice with malt to smooth it out, sweet but not sugary, fruit but in a mellow way. very easy to drink and a smooth concoction that is so easy to make disappear. absolutely love the glass.
"
1," Ok. For my 100th beer I wanted something special. This is it. May not be the best trappist out there but ""for the money"" its great. Recommend this one as a ""seat down and sip two or three beer"" types. Love it.
"
1," Bottle at home. Another fantastic beer. Chimay is really excellent for such a commonly available beer. Foamy head and very nice aroma. Prefer the white, by a hair.
"
1," This has a full bodied flavor without the complexity of the bleu.  I didnt notice the floral and berry like flavors on the palate. Very Good in its own right.
"
1," Poured redish with a little head and no lacing.  There wasnt much aroma but what was there was slightly towards toast.  It had a dry sour taste but wasnt to strong.
"
1," Bottle, thanks pivnizub. Probably the fullest commercial bottle I ever opened, there was beer to the brim. Cloudy brown, small UFOs, brown-white lacing head.  Banana, chrismas spice and bread aroma. Somewhat astringent on the palate, lemon, pumpernickel with banana, spices and some jelly. Meshes together on the third sip. Bready aftertaste. Solid dry mouthfeel, sparkly - overall quite easy to drink.
"
1," MAY 19, 2009 Very enjoyable, particularly as it warms up, subtle spices and well hidden alcohol. Easily available which is great for such a special beer.
"
1," Very bright copper body with excellent stiff foam head that lasts. Toasted wood aroma. Full, malty flavor. Something slightly odd. Good overall.
"
1," Cloudy dark red with an off white head. Malty aroma with fruits, plum and licorice. Very balanced taste with a great sweet dry finish.
"
1," Sweet honey aroma with hops and malt. Reddish amber with a large off white head lots of carbonation. Fruity/ peach with a hint of wood. Expected it to be fizzy in the mouth but was smooth.
"
1," JAN 9, 2006 (Bottle 33 cl) Muddy brownish colour with a beautiful rocky head. Extremely dry, more dry than bitter. Some chocolatey notes. Not as full-bodied as most other trappists, but still a very beautiful experience. 040993		As ""Chimay Premiere"" 050599
"
1," Got to admit I was expecting much more from this beer.
"
1," Cask (gravity) @ The 16th Reading Beer and Cider Festival 2010, Reading, Berkshire England.Unclear medium grey orange color with virtually none head. Aroma is moderate apple, sweet pear, riped pear. Flavor is light heavy sweet and light acidic with a long duration, pear fruit, dry dry. Body is medium, texture is oily, carbonation is flat. [20100430]
"
1," I had never tried a better beer. Hundreds of beer later, I dont find it still outstanding, simply a very good beer, but it will always have a special place in my heart, because it introduced me to the beer world.
"
1," Tasty bitter with good color and little aromatic hops.  Well done, but nothing special.
"
1," Bottle 500ml @ fonefan	Pours hazy golden with a small white head. Aroma has notes of malt, caramel and hops. Taste is light sweet and medium bitter. Body is light, texture is thin, carbonation is soft.
"
1," Lots of coffee in the aroma.Pours black with a medium tan head.Light coffee and some roasted malt in the flavor.Mouthfeel was a little thin with a roasted finish.
"
1," Bottled.  Not shy on carbonation!  This beer pours an active, murky brown color with red hues.  The head is tan and bubbly.  The aroma is yeast and raisins.  Dark fruit flavors mix with yeast and caramel flavors that all compete with the alcohol warmth to find a place on your palate.  This glass is just too carbonated for me.  Other than that this is a pretty nice beer though.
"
1," Slightly hazy dark copper amber color with a large frothy white head.  Aroma of sweet malty wheat with a hint of caramel and clove with some banana yeasty esters.  Starts with pretty good fullness and sweet dark caramel and wheat along with a clove spice and banana fruitiness before a doughy semi-sweet finish.  A pretty true to style weizenbock with lots of clove character.
"
1," Not a huge fan of this beer. Trappists to me, almost always seem to have the nose and finish which suggests cloves to me, which is a good way to turn me off to a beer.
"
1," Aroma is breads, heavy malts, dark fruit. Flavor is the same with a hint of banana, bitterness is barely alive. Creamy smooth mouthfeel. A damn refreshing beer. My favorite dubbel yet.
"
1," bottle. Clear golden yellow, large head. Medium-bodied, slightly fruity and very malty. Hints of marzipane.
"
1," Expected more out of this one. Pours a nice rich brown red color with a bubbly acidic foamy head. Nose is of yeast and fruit. Nice tastes very drinkable. Tastes of malt, sugar, fruit, and yeasty. Metallic aftertaste. Good beer.
"
1," I have never enjoyed ales of any flavor until now. All I remember of it was how smooth it was and how tall the head was. Gota try that Blue now.
"
1," 
"
1," on hand pump-pours a retaining tan head and murky brown color.  Aroma is cocoa powder/caramel.  Taste is medium malt-cocoa powder/caramel, slight sour/diacytl.  Finishes semi-dry.  Light side of medium body.
"
1," Reddish brown but slightly murky. Strawberries and spice against the sweet malt background. More strawberries and some cherries on the taste. Solid structure with a tight acidity (yogurty) finish.
"
1," Watery yellow appearance with a light hoppy nose but the body isnt overly thin. Mostly hop flavours with a light hoppy aftertaste.
"
1," citrus and pine, nice grainy malt backbone, very similar to SNPA.  not a big ipa, but nice hoppy and drinkable
"
1," This is a ok Dunkel.  Sweet malt, caramel, and toffee flavors.  Finishes creamt, smooth, and clean.
"
1," Bottle.  Seethru light reddish brown with fluffy tan foam. Aroma is mainly dark sugar, earthiness and dates. Taste is butterscotch, muscavadosugar and alcohol. No noticable hops just some to balance out sweetness. Still mostly sweet tasting however. Medium to full body, some sweet stickyness, average carbonation. Overall its a pretty good beer but a bit alcoholic and not enough complexity. Liked last bit the best when I poured the yeast in, took away some sweetness. Overtly sweet,  simple flavors and a bit alcoholic and no hop aroma is this beers mayor drawbacks in my opinion.
"
1," JUN 26, 2007 love at first sight....nice yeasty aromas...cloudy and beautiful...smooth taste that is not overpowering...a wonderful beer and can not wait to get some more.
"
1," 0,33l bottle.  This is truly a ledgend among the Belgian Trappistes. Deep-dark and hazy amber body with a offwhite head. It has a perfect combination of raisins and caramel which gives the beer a smooth taste. The alcohol is more present in the aroma than in the actual taste. High on carbonation but this only enhances the impression. Chimay Blue truly deserves its great reputation.
"
1," 750ml bottle.  pours a muddy prune hue, with a very dubbel style head.  fruity aromas dominate - the obvioius apricot, also subtle pear, caramelized white grapes, orange peel, and a bit of coriander, and a distinct aroma of chocolate covered raisins.  the taste begins exceptionally smooth, almost like silk on the palate.  then the lighter malts and a healthy dose of yeast shines through mid-way, also revealing a punch of carbonation.  that apricot aroma bleeds into the finish, but the taste - overall - is surprisingly a little shallow.  the finish also has a touch of hop, but just nothing overwhelmingly impressive.  nonetheless, its well crafted, and its one to enjoy.  i will revisit this one.
"
1," big bottle.  dark brown pour, minimal head.  light nose.  slightly bitter.  first chimay, two more on in the fridge.
"
1," A blast of fruit hits your nose as you are pouring this, apricot, peach, raspberry.  It smells a bit boozy, you can feel the warmth of the ethanol.  Beautiful copper red appearance with a creamy head, no lacing.  Taste is plum, apricot, slight banana, yeast nuttiness, balanced by a soft sweetness and mild bitterness.  This is a very well balanced brew, body is medium, texture creamy and slick, lively carbonation, gentle finish.  I very pleased with this, I think it is equal to the Blue.
"
1," 12oz bottle- Nearly balck body with a nice tan head that dissipates quickly into a small ring. Aroma of roasted malt and coffee. Taste of coffee and more coffee with some roasted malt and sweetness. A nice nasting stout.
"
1," Bottled. An amber beer with an off-white head. The aroma has notes of lemon, hops, and straw. The flavor is sweet with notes of lemon, straw, and hops leading to a bitter finish.
"
1," A decent enough trappist, but not up there with the Chimay Blue. This one is just a little too much on the sweet side for my tastes.
"
1," Dark, cloudy copper with sizable off-white head. Fruity, sweet aroma of plums, candy along with some earthy, dusty notes. The flavor is comfortably sweet as is the finish though some moderate bitterness slips in. Lively carbonation, watery texture. Served a little too cold, it improved as it warmed. Nonetheless, there are other dubbels that have more heft, more complexity and are more rewarding for the taste buds. Not that I would turn down a Rouge if it were offered.
"
1," Bottled. Pours mahogany, with a full tan head. Smells of alcohol, yeast, and vanilla. Flavors include the above with raisin and malt. A good beer. I will have it again
"
1," Hazy orange brown pour with a white head. Aroma of hops and fruits, mostly citrus. Flavor is sweet of fruits with balanced bitterness. Solid but not particularly strong.
"
1," (Draught)  Pours a clear pale yellow body with a small white head.  Light aroma of malt, floral, and grain.  Flavor of malt, cereal, and cream.
"
1," Bottle.  The pour tells of the alcohol in this vixen.  A slow, smooth, heady one reveals a veritable rainbow from robust brown at the top, ruby red mid-glass, and almost orange at the very bottom.  Thick, sweet, lingering consistency which warms the back of the mouth a while after each sip.  Again, new to this style, but a very good beer.
"
1," One of my favorites.		Excellent combination of body and taste. Very smooth with a slight maltiness.
"
1," 12oz bottle courtesy of Acknud. Earthy aroma.  For a beer that touts an intense hop aroma, this one did not deliver.  A bit nutty even.  Very little hop aroma.  Amber and orange color.  Nice fluffy white head that stuck around.  Grassy hop flavor.   Not overally bitter like most American IPAs are. There was an off aftertaste.  I could not put my finger on it.  I would call this an APA not IPA.
"
1," Murky amber/red, little beige head. Flavor a bit yeasty, malt and grass. Faint aroma, mightve been served a little too cold. No alcohol in taste or aroma. Lovely soft feel.
"
1," Probably one of my all time favourites. The pour is a dark earthy brown with a thick beige head. Aromas of alcohol, candied fruit, dark fruits, bread, toast. Fruity esters of raisin, apricot, prune, plum and brown sugar. The taste is amazingly smooth and low on alcohol taste. Sweet candy and apples with raisin and dark fruit aftertaste. One of the sweetest and most delicious beers ever. Mild bitterness on the finish. Soft carbonation and a thick medium bodied beer.
"
1," Bottle acquired in trade with atpayne (thanks!). Slight gusher when I opened this one. Poured a medium and hazy amber color with a huge, huge off white head. Aromas of oranges, light pine, citrus, spices with some malts. Watery tastes of citrus, spices and caramel. Thin and watery body. I agree with Erics rating that the tastes were a big let down (especially compared to the aromas).
"
1," Has a peppery sweet malty nose, a medium body and a sweet rye-whiskey type finish .
"
1,"  Pours a dark hazelnut brown with a dense foamy light tan head. Throughout the session, the dense head never goes away.		Aroma"
1," JUL 5, 2004 Displays dark brown or deep ruby in the glass.  Scents of spice, malt and alcohol. The flavour has a bitter finish, slightly sweet malt taste with a hint of spice and plum.
"
1," Draught.  Poured amber gold with thick white head.  Light but pleasant aroma, medium body, malt with a good hop edge.   Lasting hop finish.  Not suitable with spice foods, but would be good with something like fish and chips.
"
1," Dark red color with decent sized head poured into a Chimay glass. Floral and spicy aromas. Nice hop bite if you look for it. I like the Blue better.
"
1," Bottle. Pours dark brown with creamy beige head. Aroma is of roasted malt sweetness, earthy. Taste is of raisin, sugars, alcohol. Lively carbonation with slightly bitter aftertaste. Definitely not my favorite Belgian but is drinkable. I think it may be slightly over-rated
"
1," Bottled 50cl. Courtesy of Quack-Duck. Reminiscence of strawberry, wormwood, herbs and pear in the nose. Nice balance between malt and hops. Good malt profile. Faint musty components. Medium bodied. Nice lacework. Subdued bitterness. Subtle carbonation. Surprisingly salty. The finish is salty with lingering wormwood. A beer with plenty of character. Thanks a lot Quack-Duck!
"
1," Cask conditioned at the BP. An almost black pour with an aroma of mostly chocoffee with a very good bitter. It was just a tad on the thin side, but overall a good beer. Had the chance to sample it side by side with the tap porter. The CC was much smoother and the chocolate seemed to come through a little better, but I did not let the tap warm to the same temp as the CC. Everyone needs to try this beer.
"
1," This beer is THE definition of the style!  I first enjoyed it in a Belgian bar in Helsinki, Finland.  It has a relatively light mouthfeel that tricks the palate into feeling that the alcohol punch is smaller than it really is (9% abv).  Balanced, smooth and wonderful!  If you can find it in the U.S., try it!
"
1," Jet black...amber head.  Aroma of coffee and bourbon.  Taste of coffee, bourbon, chocolate dark malt and nuts
"
1," MAR 16, 2004 Very nice. The color is a hazy dark brown with a massive sponge-like beige head. The aroma was very sweet...like bubblegum actually...lots of clove, banana, and some peppery spice. The flavor was sugary sweet, lots of clove, bubblegum and banana with a peppery finish. The high alcohol content did not disturb the taste at all.
"
1," 21st May 2008. 9 months past BBE date. Sour brown ale with a crispy dry finish. No bitterness.
"
1," dried plums, raspberry and yeasts.	taste sweet with some fruity tartness in the final. good alcohol feeling with the right carbonation to sustain it. body is lighter than expected
"
1," Ummm, rich and toasty good coffee! i havent had many coffee brews that i didnt like, no exception here. very rich and smoooth
"
1," Ive been a fan of Chimay bleu for six years, but since Ive been living in Auckland, temporarily, Ive noticed that the taste has changed dramatically -- for awhile, I thought it was just my imagination, but Ive since discovered that, somehow, likely during the shipping and handling process, the sediment left behind from bottle conditioning becomes diffusely distributed throughout the liquid, leaving it cloyingly sweet and hardly drinkable. As anyone familiar with bottle conditioned ale knows, theres a marked difference between a bottle that is properly handled, with the sediments on the bottom, and a bottle that has been jostled to the point where the sediments irreversibly alters the flavor, even after its been sitting on the shelf for awhile. Whatever shipping method is used to transport this otherwise top-of-the-line beer has spoiled it irreparably, and I feel sorry for those who are exposed to Chimay the first time in Auckland, because if they dont like sweet beer, they wont come back for more.
"
1," Its a nice beer, a little too much head as seems to be custom with these Belgain 750ml bottles(Maybe it is just me). but I far perfer the White.   Cant wait to try the Blue.
"
1," APR 10, 2010 Complex noseful of floral hops, yeast, iron, and pollen.  Cloudy brown pour with an odd olive tinge.  It tastes pretty dry, hoppy, and crisp, but with solid malt and light esters in the background.  Dave says this is neither a sipping beer or a gulping beer, but a slurping beer.  Chimay Rouge is not very spicy or sweet for the style.  It is almost like an American version of an abbey ale,  Very enjoyable, but downgraded a bit in 2010, because it seems a little thinner than previously.
"
1," Bomber from Crown.  Herbal nose with heather and some tire air.  Pours the deep brown of a porter, with a short light brown head.  Taste is dry and roasty but still has those herbal notes (which endure into the aftertaste, where they approach juniper and give a slightly chalky residue) and flashes of fruity sweetness.  Dark chocolate, loads of anise, licorice, but very little of the latter.  Body is watery and a bit foamy, slightly tangy but without acidity.  Refreshing and dangerously easy to drink!  Smooth and subtle, a good bridge between new and old, one of the more interesting finds of this year!
"
1," Caramel scent almost sweet with a floral touch, hints of cherry (to me) , a light brown small head dissapating quickly, has a dark body with a sweet flavour with a long finish. I am enjoying it very much and my face almost flushed after the first sup or two, I shall certainly have this again
"
1," Hazy dark brown with an off-white head. Aroma is sweet, malty, dried fruit and rather spicy. Flavor is rather sweet and slightly bitter. Sweet and spicy finish with warming alcohol. 220511
"
1," JAN 29, 2007 Slightly sour aroma, deep amber color with decent head at first.  Sweet and slightly fruity flavor with decent complexity and finish.
"
1," Pours golden with a white head. Aroma is bready malt and a little hop. Flavor is lightly bitter, with a sharp, biting quality in the middle, and a bit of citrus in the finish.
"
1, Lgre odeur dpices et dagrumes avec une pointe dalcool. Apparence
1," (swing top bottle, 33cl, courtesy of Quack-Duck) Almost clear, pale golden colour with a blond medium-sized foamy head. Slightly grainy and milky malty aroma with herbal hops. Mildly bitter flavour, light to medium bodied with a slightly sharp carbonation. Soft pale malty base present herbal hops; dry and bitter hoppy finish with a balancing malty sweetness. 30.XII.09
"
1," (swing top bottle, with thanks to Quack-Duck!) Clear, amber colour with a big and steady off-white foamy head. Slightly sweet and ashy malty nose with faint notes of citrus and peaty spice. Sweet-bitter flavour, medium bodied with a moderate carbonation. Faint toasty malty and slightly nutty taste with peaty (!?) and subtle citric notes; mildly toast-malty finish with a moderate hoppy bitterness. Somewhat strange but also pleasant to drink. 29.XII.09
"
1," 750 ml corked and caged. 	Murky copper, with a rocky tan head. Head settles quickly leaving delicate lacing behind.	Aroma is light fruit and yeast.	Flavor is much like the aroma, very light fruit, some yeast, light bittering.	Mildly dry finish.
"
1," 300 ml bottle. Sweet, soft aroma of rice and light, soft, fruits. Slight yellow tint to the sake. Big, sweet, falvor with lots of alcohol present, retronasal as well. Peppery, with peaches, minerals and lots of rice. Smooth, soft, almost cottony palate. Nice aroma and flavor but a bit too alcoholic.
"
1," As advertised... very silky going down, bitter in the end.  Was hoping for more complexity... seems a bit mild for my liking.  Have had before, but will have to try again.
"
1," 75cl bottle from Willow Bend Liquors (Tampa). Pours a dark brown with one finger white head the fades quickly but still laces the glass. Smells sweet, earthy and sugary with notes of earthiness and molasses. Taste is sweet and malty with hints of spice, molasses, and candy sugar. Rich, full-bodied ale with a smooth, lingering, malty, sugary finish.
"
1," Delicious IPA, a cause for rejoicing. Amber color. Beautiful hoppy aroma, excellent malt balance to back the hops, flavor includes distinctive Amarillo hops plus both floral and grassy hops. A beer Nebraskans can drink with pride and worth a roadtrip down I-80 for the rest of the world
"
1," Only 1 of the 3 beers I tried that I actually liked.  Not sure what the brewer would classify it as, so I entered as ""ale"" ... sorry!  Almost has the character of a Scotch Ale.  Dark black with a tan standing head.  Syrupy and thick with a definite molasses, strong malt tone.  Strong and good ... the one fine point of our visit.
"
1," Courtesy boboski.  Black with thin white head.  Moderate coffee aroma, but not sharp, a little sweet.  Thin palate.  Lots of coffee in the taste with a bitter finish.  The beer lacks some residual sweetness that would compliment the bitterness of the coffee.  But overall, a good offering.
"
1," Cask @ GBBF, 2011. Pours cloudy golden with a small off white head. Straw and a massive amount of butter. Thin body. off..
"
1," 12oz bottle-shared by decaturstevo-pours a foamy light tan head that laces and amber color.  Aroma is pine/resin, some sweet light/medium malt.  Taste is pine/resin hops with some bite, secondary sweet light/medium malt-caramel.

1," Bottle.  Aroma of floral hops, some soapy notes.  Appears a medium amber color with slight effervescence and little head.  Flavor is well-balanced, with floral yet earthy hops resting atop a neutral malt backbone.  Palate is medium and appropriate.  Overall, a refreshing brew, and an excellent example of the style.
"
1," Bottle. Pours a dark brown, with a brief offwhite head. Pleasant aroma - spicy and fruity,  with plum, raisin, and floral. Flavor is even better, with spices, fruit, including plum, raisin, caramel, and roasty malt. I had the pleasure of having this in Belgium first, during my stay in Iper. In a small restaurant, I had ordered what became a wonderful meal of steak and a bucket of Belgian fries. The Chimay was recommended by my friend. Served with the Chimay chalice glass, it was really good. So good, I ordered another, before I realized it was 9% ABV! Luckily, I was only a short walk away from the hotel...
"
1," Another great chimay brew.  A dark reddish brown but easy drinking belgian.  Not near as much of the wine like tastes of the blue or the tripel, but a very good dubbel.
"
1," Almost muddy coppery body with orange/caramel glints. Large beige foamy head that gets bubbly after 3 or 4 minutes. Delightful fruity and vineous aroma. The various nuances (raisin, dark cherries, apricot...) makes it quite complex. Taste is characterised by relatively strong hoppy flavors. Alcohol remains well hidden, and the finish is surprisingly mild. Very good stuff... a classical choice.
"
1," 750ml. Poured an orange hint with a tan head. Aroma is floral and fruity. Taste is full bodie has a banana hint in the finish.
"
1," 12oz bottle.  Black pour with a medium light brown head.  Malty aroma with a tad bit of hop and some booze.  Lots of malt flavor with some hop and coffee.  Very good because the alcohol is there but not overdone.
"
1," This one is THE beer.  Light, sweet, full body, full head that lasted right through to the end of the drink in abundance.  Aromatic, high alcohol content... this beer is a subtle alpha beer!
"
1," Great beer.  To get the full experience let it warm up a bit.  After pulling it from the refrigerator I let it sit for a 15 minutes and it really adds to the flavor.  The color is a dark, almost burnt orange.  There is not much aroma, but the taste is floral and smooth.
"
1," Dark golden with a huge creamy white head. Aroma is sweet and fruity with some notes of yeast and apricot. Flavour is spicy, malty and caramelly with some hints of raisin.
"
1," Really I think some people expect Belgium beers to be strong and off putting, and some are. This beer is light and delicate. It really draws you in with its subtlety. An easy drinking masterpiece. The kind of beer that if you had to choose one beer that  you would drink the rest of your life, you would choose this. Dark fruits in the flavor. Prunes, figs and raisins. The mild smoothness and complexity are superb. Tingly carbonation that lifts a very faint cinnamon and clove in the background. The more you drink it the more you discover its perfection.

"
1," Draught at All Colorado Beer Festival.  Pours clear orange with a spare, fizzy, white head, diminishing with spare lacing.  Aroma is average malt (bread, caramel, nutty), light hops (herbs, grass), average yeast (dough) with notes of brown sugar.  Light bodied, thin texture, average carbonation, and a bitter finish.  Average duration, light sweetness and acidity, moderate bitterness.
"
1," I wasnt impressed. I was just depressed.------ miss my $5
"
1," Flaske. 2006. Min frste krlighed. Og stadig en fantastsisk l. Desvrre trkker det enorme bundfald fra. Samt det faktum at alkoholen ikke er s godt balanceret som jeg husker den.
"
1," Bottle received from StFun.  Dark brown/amber pour with a little carbonation.  Aroma was very nice, noticeable plum and candi sugar that reminded me of my own homebrew!  Flavor was sweet,  thick and  malty and finished a little bitter.  Nice belgian style, although I wish the flavor had lived up the the killer aroma.
"
1," Thanks to Hopdog for this one as part of Mystery Swap #2.  Pours hazy medium copper with luscious 2-finger off-white head.  Aroma of wet hops, tropical fruit (tangerine, grapefruit, honeydew, even cherry and berry notes), heavy black pepper.  Tastes hoppy, with a firm caramel malt base, plus some fruity notes.  It stays a bit sticky and on the sweet side, with more citrus as it warms.  This one is very good.  A tad more complexity and balance would have catapulted this one into the low to mid 4.0 pantheon.
"
1," Pours dark brown with a large head. Yeast-dominated aroma and a sweet, dry flavor. Little evidence of alcohol. Very good, but I was a little disappointed with this one.
"
1, Malty with a hint of whiskey	-Appearance
1," busy and demonstrative spicy in an appreciative way with coffee and chocolate flavors a touch of pepper and something like anise that is quite mild substantive yet light enough to be a serious drinker smokiness on the side of ashey it is again light in that quality making it attractive during every sip light tingly hop character with the flavors nicely muted the beer is a winner
"
1," Pours an opaque black with a effervescent airy dark tan head.  Aroma of roasted malts and fresh coffee with a touch of earthy dark chocolate.  Starts lightly sweet with some dark caramel notes and bittersweet chocolate balance before a thinner roasty finish.  Pretty smooth and drinkable, but I wish the finish had a little more fullness to it.
"
1," bought over by the one called stumac, this started Stumelgram IV ... soapy yet almost firm head ... lots of grassy deliciousness, but as it warms enjoyment fades ... dark caramel colour .. some sweetness ...  corn!! ...

1," NOV 15, 2003 (Worst case scenario, a fresh 33cl bottle)...Minty basil perfumes mingle with a subtle creamy effluvium...Thin tinny yeast and vagabond sugar splash the palate and remain, dead leaves with overripe berries on the lifeless autumn floor...An appallingly average rendition which does not live up to the megahype it is still getting...Don't get me wrong, it is still a good beer...Just a far cry from others in its field...(Best case scenario "
1," (bottle) Pours black with a very small tan head.  Aroma consists of burnt malt and some coffee.  Taste is strong on roasted malt and slight coffee, with a nice smooth finish and lingering roast.  Not too bad, a little thin.
"
1," Pour is a cloudy brown with a average white head.  Aroma is a nice mix of earthy hops and dark malts.  Also has a rye aroma to it.  Flavor is decent as well.  Very much citrus hops with some butterscotch and dark fruit.  Never heard of this brewer before but this is pretty darn good.
"
1," bottle, thanks to thirdeye11, cloudy amber with malty aroma, flavors of plain citrus, caramel and hops, cardboard on the finish

1," Pours a dark brown with a fizzy head. Aroma is floral with yeast.  Very nice and tasty.  Nice carbonation and the malt is just right. For starter or pro this is a good beer.
"
1," Pours dark caramel color.  Fruit and yeast aroma.  Taste is smooth roasted malt with only a slight bitter hoppiness.  Complex beer with fruit notes - especially raisin and plum.
"
1," SEP 15, 2007 Draft... Rating #1100... Crystal clear and as deeply copper as a freshly minted penny. Small, creamy, off-white head with terrific lacing and great retention.	The nose is malty and hoppy with notes of broth, horse blanket, straw and jalapeno pepper. Some floral hops as well.	Carefully bittered flavor with notes of grapefruit rind and alcohol. Medium-bodied with an oily mouthfeel and fizzy carbonation. Lengthy, bitter finish. Quite good!
"
1," Burs version. Hazy orange apperance, almost still looking. Huge smokey aroma. Unique leather/juniper match, extremely meaty. Floral and wheaty (in the small acidity) feel. Apricot and peach pie flavors, a fieldish campfire on the tongue, this is strikingly tasty and demands all your concentration. Very weird as it has this farmhouse character combined with the deep smokiness of strict Bamberg styles. Thin-medium body, low carbonation. This style is a must seek!
"
1," This trappist ale pours a hazy brown colour with sexy cherry red highlights and heavy sediments. Its head is off-white and fizzy, leaving some lace. There is hardly any light going through. Aromas are of Belgian yeast and spices, not too crazy, but very nice (smooth). Mouthfeel is very smooth, with a slight burn finish. Taste is of dark fruits, not too sweet, but more on the quiet side. A pleasant strong ale, but expected more from the taste department.
"
1," pours a cloudy brown with thick foamy head.  fruity aroma, dark fruits, like figs.  a bit of brown sugar in the taste.  robust flavor.  excellent
"
1," The best. I have been a life long American beer guzzler, until I discovered tasty beer. the local newspaper says American forces in Iraq discovered a warehouse, owned by one of Saddam's boys, full of Chimay,  Why, I thought, better try it. Its great I found out. Since then My quest for great beer has begun. Nothing surpasses the taste of Chimay Bleu. Pure nectar.
"
1," I like St. Bernardus better than I do this, but I did enjoy this beer. A dark brown caramel color, is the best way for me to describe the appearance of this beer. Definitely a decent beer, and worthy of a beer lovers tastebuds. This beer was sweet, dark fruits come to mind. The head was excellent, it didnt get in the way of my drinking, as some heads have been known to do. Even though there is a high alcohol content it affect the beer, but enhanced its qualities. I only have one negative thing to say about this beer and that is the aroma was quite weak, other than that I was very pleased with this beer.
"
1," Poured a murky dark brown with a medium sized tan head. Smelled like sweet bread. Taste was lightly carbonated...Light taste of fruit, apples, honey, with a slightly hoppy finish. I enjoyed this, but I actually prefer the flavor of the red chimay, I think.
"
1," Pretty much a classic. Nice sherry color, rich aroma of mild, herbal hops, almost a root beer herbal and root quality, and a lush bready yeastiness. On the palate, sweet and malty, complex, oaky, fruit, dried and fresh, concord grapes, more root beer, malty, smooth carbonation, modest creamy head. Finish is sweet and minty, typical of the type, and excellent. Ive had very good Chimay Red before and the White is interesting - but this is clearly the flagship brew.
"
1," [Bottled, January 2007] Burgundy color. Brief large frothy head. Fizzy mouthfeel. Fruity aroma and flavor. Combination of cherry and apricots. Reminiscent of Three Philosophers yet more inviting.
"
1," (On tap) Nashville. Very pretty, clear, reddish brown with a creamy, off-white head leaving some laces. Caramelish, roasted nose. Medium body, sweetish with notes of caramel and nuts. Lightly hoppy finish. 290306
"
1," 12oz bottle poured in a shaker.  I found this bottle in a small liquor store in Granite City, Illinois.  I bought it as part of a pick-n-pack combination.  BIB IPA pours murky orange with large pulp and a medium semi-soapy looking head.  The combination of the pulp and the murkiness is a bit disconcerting if youve never had an unfiltered beer.  Even with experience the darker beer color doesnt look appetizing.  The nose is mostly hop-generated citrus with a very faint malt tone.  The body is oily and surprisingly thick for an IPA but it works well.   The hop bitterness is quite prevalent, pushing most other flavors to the side.  A touch of heather or clover peeks through though.  This beer isnt bad but the bitterness is more reminiscent of an imperial IPA than a straight IPA.  This is probably a local favorite but falls just a little shy when compared to some of the American great IPAs.
"
1," 330ml bottle. Pours dark brown with burgundy highlights. Small, fizzy head. Smells dark and sweet malty with a good dose of alcohol. RIpe dark fruit scent as well. Tastes dark, ripe fruity malty, raisins. Some alcohol as well. Medium body, thoroughly coats the mouth, fizzy carbonation.
"
1," A pale ale with a thick nitro white head. In aroma, good hops, very British, restrained and pleasant. In mouth, syrupy malt with lots of berries, residual sugars, oily mouthfeel, and sharp hops. On tap at brewpub Dec. 30 2008.
"
1," 75 Cl. bottle. Aside from the massive amount of of foam released upon opening this beer (due to my own mishandling) this beer was a serious treat. Though not as strong as I would have liked (compared to its Trappist counterparts) this beer demonstrates a great, balanced flavor and a smooth finish.
"
1," Mandarin orange amber ale???? ok???? Beer appears to be amber brown as it sits in the unfortunate clear bottle. Aroma is interesting and surprisingly good. Aroma is of mandarin oranges but its the canned version not fresh, toast, hints of sour. Carbonation is a bit sharp and stingy. Beer taste very unique and Im digging this. Cereal type malts, and a very obvious but not over bearing canned mandarin flavor. Just got the flavour it almost a perfect mach to that Italian pop ""Orangina"" mixed with some beer. I can drink this brew but Id probably get sick of it after a couple and would only want to have once or twice a year but this still  a good brew.
"
1," Courtesy of stfun.  Pours a slightly hazy gold with a white head.  Smells citrussy with some wheat undertones.  Tastes of lemons with some perfume and touches of wheat.
"
1," Bottle shared by EDA. Too much bourbon for a beer like this. Kind of oaty, lots of bourbon aroma. Vegetal, chalky, more bourbon flavor. A bit wheaty. Flavor isnt too bad.
"
1," Chimay Bleue is a very nice Trappist beer. I sampled this directly after tasting a Chimay Red and was very happy with the increase in both flavor and richness. A very nice dark brown color with an appealing head and sweet rich taste make this one of my favorite beers.
"
1," Dark brown, notes of pine.  meh.  Little sweaty, spun and nowhere all at once.  Rhetorical.
"
1," Beautiful golden color, slightly opaque with a nice head.  Sweet aroma with a light carbonated mouth-feel with a hoppy finish thats dry and  satisfying.
"
1," FEB 6, 2007 Re-rating this. I think I was a little gushing with my original rating, Ive tasted equally nice and nicer beers since. Still though, fantastic beer. Looks nice and dark. Cracking smell, great mouthfeel and the flavours are complex. Spice, sugar and fruits. Pretty widely availble too, which is nice.
"
1," nice minty nose with sweet chocolatey malts.  pleasant, rich, but nice mild taste.  forget After Eight dinner mints, this is the perfect dessert beverage.  well, maybe not quite perfect.  was hoping for a little more chocolate in the finish.
"
1," Has a dark cidery color and a wine/port smell.  Taste is slightly wheaty with a port type alcohol flavor and finishes slightly bitter.  Overall again not the best, but not something I would like to drink regularly.  I am not into the port flavoring....
"
1," bottle - hazy brown beer with a beige head. A lot of yeast and fruity flavour. Some banana. Sweet and malty flavour. Traces of bread and yeast. Alcohol is easily detectable.

1," Bomber courtesy of stfun.  Pours dark brown with a thin light brown head.  Smells of up front bourbon, some sweet malt.  Tastes of bourbon, spice, earthy, chocolate, some dark fruit.  Decent.
"
1," Bottled, brown, good barley taste and aroma, very good balanced, very very good
"
1," Apple cider unfiltered appearance. Foams up nicely and thins out to a hlf centimeter head. Slight lacing on the glass. Apple cider-ish scent. Slightly bitter on the tongue, but sweet once warmed in the mouth. VERY carbonated with a bite on the sides of the mouth. Generally pretty pleasant, still figuring out the spice (a slight, very slight nutmeg and cinnamon with the caramel). More citrusy fruits on the nose. (750ml Bottle Pour of 2005 Vintage 11/21/2006)
"
1," A classic ""cant go wrong"" ale that goes well with anything and everything.
"
1," Blond color. An ordinary Lager, with a light cereals aroma, stronger cereals flavor with some malt, and strong bitterness. Below average.

1," Bottle. Red brown colour with a beige head. Aroma is cellar, caramel, spices. Flavour is roasted, balanced, fruits, caramel, spices, malt.
"
1," Sweet Magnolia Brown Ale; the name alone intones lush visions of rich nuts, brown sugar, and maybe even just a touch of spice. Quite an accomplishment for a brown ale based just on her name. Fourth in my lineup of beers from Seven Bridges Grill & Brewery in Jacksonville, FL I hope she lives up to her name. A good brown ale is a pleasure all her own.		She comes to me a burnt copper with brown earthen tones where the light manages to shine through. A small head lingers on top, awaiting my eventual disturbance. Right away roasted malts and nuts (chestnuts), caramel, toffee, sweet raisins, chocolate, and cherries carry my senses away. A very promising start. Wasting no more time, I reach for my glass and savor the first quaff. A fuller body then some brown ales, she is replete with tons of bitter nuts right up front while chestnuts and bitter lemon esters follow-up. As I delve further into my glass, the lemon zest becomes more prominent, pushing some of the nuts to the background. Despite her fantastically varied nose, this is sadly about all that her body and palate come to. Not complex at all and unfortunately not able to live up to neither her name nor her nose, the Sweet Magnolia Brown Ale falls short.		Brown ales are great session beers. Full flavored with a rich body and highly quaffable, when I want a beer to enjoy a few of, brown ales are an easy choice. The Sweet Magnolia Brown Ale fails to live up to my expectations of a quality brown ale. She definitely had potential and I wouldnt drain-pour her, but there definitely could have been more complexity to her personality.
"
1," Bottle thanks to blutt59. Marked as the 7.7% ABV version. Gusher with a large tan head a hazy amber brown body and some particles. Aroma of apple, raisin, alcohol, wheat and plantains. Taste is yeasty with wheat clove and harsh banana. Lively carbonation.
"
1," Belgian Strong Ale"" Blind Tasting 07.  I not sure what happened here but this was one of the shocks of the night.  Pours a clear amber brown with a light brown fizzy head and good lacing.  A light yeasty dough rasin aroma, not bad but light at the point that we came to it.  Brown rasins, sugar, sweet, hops, in need of a malt backbone.  The heat is too much with the light medium body.  Finishes lightly astringent, metallic and alcoholic.    Il rate it again with the ""blind fold"" off and see if its better.
"
1," Cask at Blackfriars, Glasgow.  Nut brown. Sweet and hearty. Fruity and slightly rubbery with almost full body. Some sulphur in a minerally finish. Warming and with lots of character, but also some flaws.
"
1," Thin, light, dry appleskin aroma.  Clear and very pale and still with no legs.  Mild puckering appleskin-like flavour.  Somewhat watery and lifeless.  Bottle.
"
1," Lightly dark mahognay color with a decent head and moderate lace. Aroma is sweet carmely malt with a tinge of nuttieness. Flavor starts sweet and malty gives way to a carmel nuttieness and finishes moderatly bitter and thin. Nothing complex, just malt with a bitter end, a little thin and a bit too sweet, but not bad.
"
0," Dark brown/red, lots of lacing, large head with good retention. Aroma of Chimay-yeast and a very peculiar spicyness that I cant put my finger on, but I sure as hell dont like it. It is somewhere in between baby-food (the canned sludge) and stale puke - with a bit of goose liver thrown in. This smell got more and more pronounced as the beer warmed. Dark fruit in the background though, if you can believe it. Decent taste, a bit too soft/rounded for me - maybe too balanced. And ofcourse, the gooseliver babypuke notes didnt help much. Smooth mouthfeel, a bit like the aforementioned babyfood-sludge, stale puke and goose liver were thrown into a blender and mashed into a delicious smoothie. Not much carbonation, but hey, what would you expect from a goosepuke babyliver smoothie anyway? This one started out like a fine, fine dubbel but turned into something that reminded me of what lies behind the gates of Hell.
"
1," Herber, stark dunkel-hopfiger Antrunk. Etwas modrig, der Hopfen wirkt nicht sehr frisch. Spter wird das Bier sehr stark bitter, ohne sein Hopfenarome steigern zu knnen. Das Bier wirkt so unausgeglichen. Nur wenig malzig. Stark bitterer Abgang. Es mangelt an aromatischen Hopfennoten, zudem ist keine Fruchtigkeit erkennbar, die die meisten IPAs deutlich aufpeppen. Netter Versuch..der es wohl auch bleiben wird.
"
1," Bottle. Thanks to a Secret Santa - I think last summer. Poured a dark body with thin head. aroma is dried fruit, earthy. Flavor has a light chocolate and caramel taste, yeasty and slightly bitter.
"
1," Fruity hop aroma that the Belgians seem to do so well, enchanting mouthfeel little carmel sweet in the middle and seemed to get sweeter towards the end. Alcohol sneaks up on you. Glob of foam stays till the end. Not a bold enough flavor to be a beer to sit and contemplate
"
1," Bottle.  Aroma is oats, dark roast.  Opaque with a big cola colored head.  Flavor is light, dominantly charred oat and malts.  Light and thin in the mouth.

1," IPA and watermelon do not mix.

1," This is the second of the Chimay beers for me and most likely the last. Got a severe headache after drinking this one.. The color and head are good for appearance but the flavor is lacking, and I running low on Tylenol.
"
1," 750 ml bottle. Dark amber color, thick fizzy head. Sweet almost fruity aroma. Tastes like it smells, hint of fruit and roses. The high alcohol is barely hinted at. Fizzy texture but very smooth. Great beer.

1," 2011-06-08, bottle from Getrnke Fritze Bergtheim, 7-5-6-3-14=34Hazy light amber color; generous, compact head. Delicate, nice aroma of fine malts. Mild malt flavor, but with some quality; there is a light residual sweetness; correct bitterness, but without a specific hop profile. The final is rather simple, with still some light sweetness.Pleasant also from the bottle.2011-02-13, draught at the brauhaus, 8-4-6-3-14=35Hazy amber color; generous head. Excellent aroma of biscuity malts. The flavor is quite sweet, with good malt flavor, low bitterness, but also quite weak in the end. Pleasant Mrzen.
"
1," 500 ml flip-top bottle in Stuttgart, Germany. Is a clear amber color with a white head. Aroma of nuts, lemon, and lots of spices and malt. Taste is rathe tame. Palate is smooth but has a strong character.
"
1," bottle. Poured cloudy reddish-brown with off-white head. Citrus, yeasty aroma with some pepper. Peppery flavour with high carbonation that bites the tongue. Astringent finish.
"
1," (Bottle).  The head foams up and overflows!  Open this one in the sink, or at least be careful.  A rich, warm aroma, not very beer-like, more wine-like.  Caramelly and malty, the high alcohol content is definitely noticeable.  A lot of complex fruity aromas emerge...like different kinds of dried fruit.  Somewhat sweet, and not much bitterness.  Although the beer foamed up initially, the beer feels flat as you drink it.  Enjoyable, but I not quite as impressed as the other reviewers.
"
1," Received a bottle of this in trade @ DLD 2010.  Overall, I would say this beer is worth trying once, but not something I would seek out again.  Alcohol is somewhat noticable, but not overbearing.  Leaves a bit of a spicy aftertaste.
"
1,"  This one pours with a small white head that dropped off almost immediately and left no lacing.  It is an absolutely clear amber color.  The aroma is a little light, although pleasant.  Just hints of some toffee, malt, roastiness and earthiness.  The taste is good.  It had just a touch of sweetness to it.  Pretty good balance with a hint of bitterness on the finish.  No bad, it will appeal to many, but is rather non-descript.
"
1," MAY 4, 2008 Corked Bottle.  Terrific thick head which dissapates into light frothiness,  Great rich tones oh aroma.  Taste is like nothing I have had before.  Strong carbonation with deep amber and stought tastes.  Fantastic finish worthy of its name.  A great buy no matter what time of year.
"
1," This pours dark brown with a good rich color.  This is not the best Chimay has to offer but still a top of the line beer as it is well rounded from front to back.  The aroma could be better, but the taste makes up for it.
"
1," Much darker than the other two chimays Ive had.  Even the head seems browner.  Great aroma.  Sweet blend of malts and yeast bring out some very sweet-fruit-like scents.  Definately the best tasting chimay so far.  Lots of apples and spice flavors.
"
1," This brew poured a medium head offinely sized mostly lasting bubbles that left a fair lacing and a transparent carbonated golden colored body behind.  It had a smooth bubbly mouthfeel.  This brew did not taste like a wheat beer to me.  It was much more thin on it flavor with notes of bread and it was slightly acidic.  Its weak mouthfeel made it seem more like a soda pop/
"
1," Very good beer, had it at a Mortons. Appearance and Aroma arent as great, but the taste more than makes up for it.
"
1," Draught, 33 cL. Dark yellow colour with long lasting head. Excellent balance and variation in the flavour of malt, sweetness, yeast, bitterness and alcohol. Excellent!

1," The first time I had this brew, I was in love.  That was before I had other Belgian ales.  A very dark color with an almost mettalic taste.
"
1," 5/1/11. 12oz bottle from Cavie. Hazy orange pour with a huge off-white head that sticks and laces. Somewhat mild citrus aroma with hints of caramel malt. Decent malty flavor with a hint of salt and a touch of citrus and bitter hop.
"
1," A nice looking wheat.  Aroma offers coriander but not a lot more.  First sip features a little zing on the back of the throat but that lasts for only a couple of sips.  It settles on the tip of the tongue.  Overall it is a creamy mouthfeel.  Flavor is full of clove and spices.  Sweet citrus fruit is also easily noticeable.  An interesting and unique wheat.
"
1," poured into my chimay glass. didnt realize its a bottle fermented beer. aroma is fruity. flavour is fruity also, but I detect no dryness. overall an ok beer.
"
1," Draft. Pours amber with a white head. Lightly sweet malty aroma, but relatively clean and grainy. The flavor is malty, with sweet and grainy notes, and not much else. Pretty good.
"
1," 12oz. bottle.  Aroma of faintly milky chocolate, creamy dark toffee and deeply roasted malts.  Dark brown-black color with a fine, subsiding head.  Roasty, bittersweet malt flavors dominate, with a blend of coffee, lightly charred grains, cocoa, a very light dried fruit character and a gently spicy hop character towards the drying, tangy finish.  Thin and smooth on the palate with a medium body.  Highly drinkable for the style.  Surprising that this is labeled a Winter seasonal.
"
1," Malty and light hoppy aroma. Amber color, hazy, beige head. Malty, yeasty, sweet, light bitter start but ends rather bitter, light dry.
"
1," Bottle This cider rocks! Pours perfectly clear and amber (nearly copper) with decent, lengthy legs. The complex bouquet is a lush swirl of candied fruits, vintage medium sherry and fallen apples with a splash of dark rum. Full-bodied with a syrupy, yet velvety, mouthfeel. Sweet fuzzy fruit, brandy and plum flavors intermingle with fallen apple funkiness. Finishes sweet, overripe and warming with a whisper of acidity. This world class bottle of ice cider was shared by the ever generous Maltzilla!
"
1," Poured a dark amber.  Complex palate which is satisfying.  A nice beer to savour - alcohol content is not overpowering.  Not the best Chimay of the 3  in my humble opinion.

1," bottle-pours black tan red head. smells sour rasberries, astonshingly like a lambic, tastes really sour like a lambic as well. some butter, a nice surprise 3.7	RERATE-	upon further inspection of a second bottle of celtic ale from the sconser lodge in skye, the first bottle i had was really a few months off. and the second bottle i had wasnt quite as off and showed the taste that it was meant to be. which really light tasting buttery toasty tasteless porter. i think if you like lambics or anything like that, than you should get one of these ales and cellar it until its off. it tastes amazing. however for the fresh one, 2.5.

1," Bottle, 5%. Weak spicy aroma. Cloudy yellow colour. The flavour has some clove, a little sweetness and the standard dusty wheat flavour. More of a German Hefeweizen than a Belgian wit, which the name also suggests, I guess.

"
1," 1PT bottle.  07/09 vintage.  This is the first time I have tried Blue this early in its life.  Orange brown with a nice tan head.  Roasty, hay with citrus and floral nose.  This will probably take at least a year to open up.  Sweet, slight sour, clean finish, and relatively complex even at this stage but the balance is still not there.  A great beer that needs to age and settle a bit more.

1," Brown with a good head on it. Sweet crisp aroma. Crisp, fresh, refreshing taste. Creamy, great body that fades perfectly. Sweet with good solid brown taste. Smooth. Great brown ale.
"
1," From a growler at DLD - Pours dark brown with no head.  Aroma of coffee and roasted malts.  Flavor is coffee, roasted malts.  Palate is somewhat watery with a  lingering coffee aftertaste.
"
1," Dark & cloudy reddish brown colour with a thin beige head. Slightly fruity aroma. Full bodied with average carbonation. Light bitterness. Flavours spicy and sweet with some banana like flavours detected. Creamy/smooth mouth feel with a dry finish. Quite enjoyable.....  -330ml bottle.
"
1," 33CL bottle, white great head, good golden color. Nice hop taste. Overall good beer.
"
1," Brown body of course, small head. Lightly roasted, chocolate aroma. The flavor is more caramel and nutty.
"
1," Thick creamy head over a dark brown ale. Rich taste, sweet malt with some typical Belgian sourness in the finish. A great beer!
"
1," Bottle. Off-white short head. Unclear orange red body. Aroma of berries. First impression of flavor is sweet berriest is however modified by the powerful carbonation.
"
1," De mmoire. Quelle allure ! Bire blonde jaune, lgrement voile, avec une abondante et superbe mousse de meringue fine, arienne. Cest  ce jour une des plus belles bires que jai vu, splendide ! Parfum floral lger, dherbe verte et tendre. Got franc et intense, pic, citronn. Alcool puissant, relev, chaud. Palais onctueux mais frais. Une bire fantastique.
"
1," Draft... Disney Boardwalk Location... Clear, pale, straw-colored ale with a small, creamy, white head. Typical hefe aroma, but a bit subdued... plenty of banana and light clove. Decent flavor with crisp hop bitterness and spicy phenols. Light to medium-bodied with a skim-milk mouthfeel and fizzy carbonation. Crisp, lightly sweet finish.
"
1," This is my favorite of the Chimays.  A very pleasant malty flavor and a balance thats enjoyable.  Check it out.
"
1," 12 oz bottle shared with padrefan98.  Nice black pour with only a small amount of head.  Aromas were decent with mostly coffee, but I also thought I picked up some coconut.  The flavors were bitter cappuccino.  Somewhat watered down, but decent.
"
1," You will have to excuse me as this is the first Belgian Ive ever had. The taste was new to me, but wow, this was great. Amazing how the taste seems to change in your mouth. Very good and worth the price.
"
1," JUL 14, 2006 Tap in Nashville.  Absolutely has a strong fruit (green apple especially)  element in the taste.  All together though, the malts and the hops blend well for a smooth red ale.  May be my favorite beer that Big River has to offer.
"
1," Roasty. Pours dark, dark brown. Lots of flavors to keep up with......slight ""wine"" aftertaste. Overall, good brew to me.
"
1," Outstanding. I love the yeasty aroma, the dark brown hue, the tan head rich and thick. I love the malty body and the way it feels in the mouth. I love the way the flavors zip through nutty to fruity to malty --  exceedingly complex. I love the sweet finish, and the lingering aftertaste. Pour me another ... please?
"
1," Nashville. Dark brown with an off-white head that somewhat lasted and produced nice rings down the glass. Aroma of sweet malts and a light floral background. Sweet flavor of caramel and coffee. Medium body. Not bad but probably not my first pick from this place.
"
1," Bottled 330ml (BB 03/2011)	Golden clear color, small white head. Grassy, herbal aroma with some hints of sweetness (diacetyl). Medium-bodied. Herbal hoppyness, some grainy notes, kind of baking yeast flavor. Odd sweetish pils.
"
1," Rollin....""roll em out""! Keep them oranges rollin bizznaby yummy malt
"
1," 12 oz. bottle, courtesy of DrMatt - thanks for this midwest IPA!  Pours hazy medium amber with a small whitish head that leaves spotty lace.  Mild aroma primarily of toasty malts and floral hop notes with a hint of orange.  Flavor comes across more strongly, toasty malts again, hints of caramel provide a counterpoint to the floral, piney and grapefruit rind hoppiness, finishing with astringent spicy tingle.  Medium to full body and prickly carbonation.  Quite enjoyable.
"
1," Really? This beer lacked taste, aroma......   Very extremely subtle flavors...... what is all this fuss about chimay???? I still need to try chimay blue. This beer was better than budweiser, but really? Is this really a craft beer?  nothing special. A VERY AVERAGE BEER. Did i get a bad batch? practically water.
"
1," NOV 19, 2006 Deep rich black pour and a moderate tan head grace this brew.  The nose is an appetizing combination of espresso and molasses.   These lead the way in flavor, too.  The bitter coffee profile is a tad overstated, perhaps...but I still liked it.   Some chocolate, roasted maltiness. dark fruits, and oatmeal round out the flavors.  The mouthfeel was a little too thin for my liking...as others have pointed out before me.   But generally I enjoyed this one very much.
"
1," 330. Pours grainy, essentially opaque dark, dark brown. Thick, sudsy tan head that falls away, leaving a little bit of intermittent spotty lace. Nice nutty, caramelly, husky nose--much more cerealy and American than I remembered. Medium body, soft and tight carb. Sweet brown sugar and brown bread kicks off the mid-palate and holds sway til the end. Very nice rich autumnal/wintry food beer for roasty, gamey business aplate. Chimay essentially should never be taken for granted, no matter how often you walk down the supermarket aisles and see it sitting there. Great stuff. Never get tired of it.
"
1," Bottle courtesy of gillard. Pours a cola brown color with reddish highlights and thin off-white head. Aroma is sweet and malty with notes of ripe dark fruit, vinegar, caramel, brown sugar, and some hints of honey and spice. Flavor is sweet and malty with notes of ripe dark fruit, caramel, brown sugar, some hints of vinegar and spice. Generally medium body with a pleasing sweet malt finish.
"
1," Bottle 750ml @ RBNAG-11	Pours cloudy orange with a off-white head. Aroma has notes of malt, yeast and dried fruits. Taste is medium sweet and light bitter. Body is medium, texture is oily, carbonation is soft.
"
1," Deep amber body with a moderate white head, the nose has touches of grain, citrus, caramel, and soap.  Light to medium body, carbonated.  The flavor was citrusy but like the glass was not rinsed of a soapy residue.  Not appealing.
"
1," The bottle looks good, the beer in the glass also. Starts a bit sourish and dry, turns then spicy, a bit wheat. Round finish. Not bad!
"
1," Thin white head on a pale yellow body. Light grassy aroma. Very little carbonation. Somewhat sweet but with a grassy aftertaste.
"
1," Crushed at the Crescent Moon. Huge bitter hop bite the whole way through. Nice ipa. Not much balance. Mostly just bitter but thats fine with me.
"
1," (Bottled) Hazy light brown color with medium, lacy head. Quite strong and distinctive, fruity aroma with yeast and old socks. Very fruity, sweetish, slightly sour flavor. Medium-bodied, slightly sugary palate with medium carbonation.
"
1," Dark beer with a nice brown head. Malty aroma, some alcohol. Good taste, also malty, strong alcoholic .Maybe a little too carbonated. I love this one.
"
1," A great trappist ale, very nice head with tight carbonation. Very well balanced with lots of fruity undertones. I find that it is best when served slightly below room temperature in a wide mouthed goblet.
"
1," Pours a pale yellow. Very sweet and malty. Also quite floral and hoppy. Somewhat perfumed finish.
"
1," Honest head; rosy-red, hazy hue; intense and inviting nose; strong and yeasty flavor, yet subtly sweet and soothing. Very smooth and drinkable, with small, tightly compacted bubbles. Very mild overall, yet not boring at all. I took it up a notch with some stinky Chimay cheese. It went unbelievably well with the beer. Addtl note"
1," Deep brown, but don't let the darkness fool you.  Every swallow you take, the smoother it gets!  This is something that you drink not too cold, let it sit out for 20 minutes or so to warm up. My favorite Belgian ale!
"
1," Pours dark brown / burgundy with a lightly sudsy tan head.  The aroma has sweet brown sugar, creamy caramel, toffee, vanilla bean, heavy cream and Belgium maltiness.  Nice aroma.  Medium / full body with very gentle lightweight carbonation.  The flavor starts with the brown sugar aspect with a bit of sourness and anise.  There is some Belgium-like aspect in there, but it is more faint and the cream is gone.  The finish is fairly sharp with traits in the initial taste.  This is quite good and the best Ive had from the brewery.  As it warms a caramel / dark toffee aspect comes out quite a bit.
"
1," Very nice beer. Beautiful deep orange color. Strong clove aroma and taste. Mild hops, not bitter at all.
"
1," This is the first Chimay I have had, but hopefully not the last. Ive been enjoying abbeys lately, as I had until recently never tried one. Served cold from bottle. Dark red/amber color with a thick off-white head. Yummy flavor with good fruity notes and sweet/bitter interplay. An enjoyable beer.
"
1," 33 ml bottle.  Pours deep, slightly cloudy copper with a thick white head.  Aroma is fruity and spicy - cloves, nutmeg, watermelon, dried peach and yeast.  Flavor is rich, sweet and spicy, though I detected a slight metallic finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy.
"
1," Nice color and aroma, just not very stout for a stout. Taste was of coffee and malt. Malt flavors lingered a little too long.
"
1,"Good fruity nose,banana...	Appearance"
1," Deep ruby colour, big creamy beige head, lacing, precipitation from the yeast. Aroma is full of yeast, sugar,dark fruit, and pretty unusual for a trappist beer som hops too. Flavour is full of sugar, alcohol, yeast and dark fruits. Mouthfeel is lively.
"
1," Has a sensational aroma of roasted malt, living yeast,  ligt alcoho taste.	one of the best pale I ever hat.
"
1," 33cl bottle, pours dark brown with ruby highlights and a sizable frothy tan head that persists, good lacing.  Aroma is a bit lacking, but provides hints of dark fruits, applesauce, brown sugar, and some yeastiness.  Flavor is also solid, but a bit ""eh"", well rounded with some dark fruit, apple, and a bit boozy.  Palate is well carbonated and lively, with a lingering finish.  I had this a few times before my official entry into ""craft beer"", and remember being much more impressed than I am now.  Still not a bad beer by a long stretch or anything, but also not in the upper eschelon of BSAs...
"
1," From a metric 12 oz into a snifter.  Pours a caramel red with lots of fuzzy head.  Head disappears quickly, leaving no lacing.  Smell is of caramel, red wine grapes and apricot.   Mouthfeel is medium to thick but somewhat light and smooth as well.  Probably from the dryness of the yeast.  Taste is very winey and yeasty.  Not too sweet at all.  Its the gold standard of belgians and I can understand why.  Well worth a try.
"
1," Bottle. Textbook IPA and pretty good for Canada. Dark amber with a big froth head. Strong hop scent and delicious balanced citrus/woody hops. Probably the best beer I have had from Dead Frog.
"
1," at least I only had to drink 4 ounces of this stuff.
"
1," The best beer there is.  If I could only have one beer for the rest of my life, this would be it.  None finer.
"
1," OCT 15, 2010 Sample at the Beer  Rock Band tasting on 08/27/2010"
1," @dstructos Daks Back-thanks diego-575ml bottlepours no head and copper color.  Aroma is cinnamon, apple/cherry.  Taste is cinnamon, sweet apple/cherry, some earthy.
"
1, An aromatic and uber-hoppy golden ale that remains very smooth refreshing.   Excellent	How
1," Cloudy brown colour with a soft tan film head. Soft but very nice yeast aroma. Many flavours and nice lasting palate. Great beer.
"
1," Pours an opaque brown colour with a thick fizzy head that quickly turns into a really nice froth. Sweet and spicy malt aroma with a yeasy presence. Spicy malt and raisin flavour with some woody notes. Nice mouthfeel. Good stuff!
"
1," (33cl bottle, received from pivnizub) Hazy, orange colour with a very short frothy white layer. Slightly yeasty and slightly sourish strong fruity aroma (peaches, citrus). Barley- and a distinctive spelt-malty taste with strong fruity notes; light bodied with a lively carbonation; malty and sour-fruity finish. Tastes like a mediocre Wheat without wheat.
"
1," Same as previous rater i think, nice beer tasty, but very heavy and slightly overwhelmed.
"
1," MAR 17, 2009 33cl bottle (brewed 2007).  Pours a nice copper color with decent head that fades, but leaves nice lacing throughout.  Some floaties were noted. Aroma is of malt, brown sugar, and raisin/prune.  Taste is pretty much the same, dark fruit, nice esters, very smooth, nice prickly co2 on the tongue.  Finish is dry with pretty low hops bitterness.  This is a great one.
"
1," Pours a dark and murky deep rich reddish amber color with just a bit of white head that quickly dissipates.		Aroma is an instant blast of dark fruits, and the flavor is quite similar but with a bit of a lingering warmth from the alcohol.		Light in the body with a fairly thin texture and some quite fizzy carbonation.		Excellent beer - I will definitely be drinking this again.
"
1," Pours with a medium brown hue with lots of head - bottle cork actually popped off. Aroma is of barley and alcohol with a little hint of metal - the metal smell drives me nuts, I really dont like it. All the other scents make up for it though. 	Flavor is sightly sweet in the beginning and lightly bitter on the end note. Beer has a medium mouthfeel with lively carbonation.	Not a bad beer overall - but the metal nose kind of turned me off. 		-ps - bud light lime is my favorite beer
"
1," Bottle... Pitch black ale with a tiny, creamy, light brown head; gone in a flash. Chocolaty, coffee nose with touches of light molasses, vanilla bean and oxidation. Semi-sweet chocolate, coffee and caramel flavor. Burnt, moderately bitter notes. Medium-bodied and lightly creamy with soft carbonation. Chocolaty, mildly bitter, dry finish.  Thanks to MIC2A for handing off the bottle prior to our short excursion to Jolly Pumpkin in Dexter, MI
"
1," golden-straw; white head, not very stable. No cold haze.	Nose"
1," (Bottle 50 cl) Fully golden with a small, creamy head. Lovely malty nose. Good, full body with sweet malts and a short, dry bitterness in the finish. Very pure and harmonious - solid German quality. 271105
"
1," pours a copper-amber/ruby w/ a generous rocky, white head that keeps bubbling away angrily. Carbonation from the bottle re-fermentation is evident. Nose is candy sugar and spicy fruits. Bananas, bread, toasted malt and a whole lot of hoppy bitterness in the flavor. Medium-bodied and extremely dry. Not as good as the Bleue, but underrated in my view. Maybe a shade too dry. Caramel and toffee notes as it warms. Finishes figs in alcohol.
"
1," Hazy rust, light tan foamy head.  Nose held dark fruit notes of raisin, fig, and touches of plum.  Underlying warmed brown sugary yeast and musty notes emerge as it continues to open up.  Flavor is more of the same with additional soft port-like notes with just a faint touch of hops in the end.  Medium to full bodied, moderate carbonation, dark fruit finish.  Still very good, but has been passed by the quality of others in the trappist catagory...
"
1," DEC 1, 2003 Lovely creamy head with a slight beige tint. This one's an old friend not visited in a long time and it looks simply beautiful!		The aroma's fruity, but not particularly strong, the taste somewhat harser than I had remembered. Somewhat sweet taste but also a strong hint of toasted bread? Not as rich or complex tasting as I remembered, but still a good slow sip for a relaxing evening.		Re-rate"
1," foamy head that doesnt hold well, cloudy light brown, simply amazing
"
1," 33 cl. Bottle. Yeasty, sugary smell upon opening, almost like an adjunct, though I know its a finishing sugar. Deep brown color. Hmm, yeah, complex, all right. Dry at first, then a bit of currant. Very heady alcohol after awhile, and always with that extra zest of finishing yeast.And now I join the dozens, if not hundreds of RBians who had red, white and blue for 75% of all of Chimays brews.
"
1," Draft sampler at Barley Island. Poured a reddish brown with a moderate off-white head that lasted with fair lacing. Moderate sweet yeasty dark fruit aroma. Medium body. Solid same sweet dark fruit flavor with an alcohol tone at the finish.  Good drinkable brew.
"
1," Bottled@GBBF2007. Dark rubyish amber colour, mediumsized beige head. Aroma is caramel, earth and some slight hints of wood. Flavour is very much the same, but the wooden hints are really strong. Aftertaste coninues along the wooden and earthy hints.
"
1," Another one I had so long ago I cant remember the details of. I enjoyed it, thats for sure. Will be back soon for a proper review.
"
1," Cork popped on its own, and lost some fizz in my unpreparedness.  This beer is totally enjoyable, but it was the last of every U.S.-available trappist that I tried, so of course I had haunting memories of Rochefort 10 and 8, Westmalle and Orval.  I would certainly prefer those.
"
1," Flowery nose. dark brown color; not much head.  Thick body, slightly hot taste.  Spicey and earthy with hints of nuts and caramel.
"
1," DEC 10, 2003 Definitely an awesome beer. I had high expectations and this beer actually met them (unlike other beers).
"
1," Draught at the Charlotte, NC Rock Bottom location. Clear brown with thin tan head. Not much aroma other than an earthiness that defies description.. Flavor is roasty and malty with nutty undertones. I also detected a hint of smoke. Strange beer.
"
1," Chimay is the perfect default beer. Youre in a store, you want something good, you dont know what to buy (if youre a novice), get the Chimay. Its just the right Belgian taste, but safe. In San Francisco, you get it on tap. Id love to go to Chimay, though, and have it in the place where it began.
"
1," Surprisingly excellent!  Gorgeous in the glass, rich, spicy, smooth.  Alcohol is hidden and this beer is very drinkable.  One of the better Belgians Ive had-it seems to have less distinctly Belgian character (the super sugary, yeasty flavors), which is nice.
"
1," Bottle 50 cl. Courtesy of Timo A. Pours a cloudy and opaque deep golden with some floating impurities and a firm, off-white head. Fresh citric aroma with some yeast. Medium body, aroma of yeast and iodine with lots of phenols and off-flavours. Dry finish. 221109
"
1," I did this beer back to back with Big Rocks IPA... WOW night and day. This is what I look for in an IPA. Great orange gold coloring with minimal head. Huge hop aroma with grapefruit, citrus, and mango. Very well balanced overall from the aroma, to the body, to the end. The hop is very consistent all the way through. Ends perfect.
"
1," Purchased at Bagel on Damen in Chicago, IL; enjoyed on a Monday night (first day back to work after Snowmaggedon 2011).  Pretty solid.  Aroma of mocha, chocolate, and heavy cream, very decadent.  Appearance pure black with a thin tan head.  Taste dominated by chocolate and lactose, also a bit of roasted malts, extremely smooth, really good stuff.
"
1," From a 12 oz. bottle with no freshness date, short blurb on the label, sampled after a few hours in the refrigerator in a pint glass.		Poured a hazy orangey copper with a small foamy white head, decent retention, settled into a creamy, sudsy lacing.		Aromas of earthy pine and citrus, mainly grapefruit and orange rind, with a light backing of caramel and biscuits.		Good, even carbonation and a crisp, dry with a little hop roughness in the palate, creamy smooth medium bodied mouthfeel.		Pleasant, enjoyable IPA taste, earthy, resiny, dry hoppiness along with some citric rind bitterness, a light numbing of the tongue, sweet sugary, caramel maltiness, a soft backing to hops, some grain breadiness as well, and a dry sour hoppy and sweet malty finish.		An easy, quaffable drinkability, I thought it had a nice balance, for me personally, a welcome addition to the shelves here in Illinois.
"
1," Nasty aftertaste. Pours a deep amber with a slightly yellow head. Nothing id every buy again.
"
1," subtle sweetness, dark fruits. Maybe even a bit of dark chocolat. Alcoholburn in the aftertaste. Very respectable brew!
"
1," Bottle, 5.2%. Distinct banana aroma, bubble gum, almost paint-like. Cloudy dark orange colour. Very big, stable creamy white head. The flavour has more banana, quite clearly. A little citrus to balance, slightly plasticky, and with a strange smoky note. Good creamy mouthfeel. Very flavourful and quite nice.
"
1," 341 ml (clear) bottle from The Beer Store (part of Winter Mixer).  Pours a clear, bright golden yellow with modest-sized white head.  Aroma is certainly true to the name with a very peppery lime character - its not cloying but its not exactly delightful.  Flavour has lime, muted a bit with the pepper, and some underlying graininess.  Light body.  Not too good, but compared to the macro lime lagers (Bud Light Lime, et al) it has the distinction of not tasting like sickly sweet soda pop.
"
1," JAN 15, 2006 2004 Vintage Rated Jan 2006. Dark brown body, with a big fluffy beige head. Sweet sugary alcohol in the aroma, brown sugar, sweet malt. Flavour has lots of sweet dark malt with a dry alcoholic brown sugar. Medium palate. Boozier than I remember but not unpleasantly so. Not as complex as others but enjoyable. Alcohol leaves pleasant lingering tingle in the mouth. 7/4/7/4/15<P>	Jan 2001 Nice, well balanced. A little more assertive than I remember the Red Cap being. 7/4/8/4/17
"
1," Pours a nice bown color with a very long lasting foamy head.  Didnt leave as much lacing as I would have thought so much head should have left.  Aromas were very vinous with currant and other dark fruits.  Flavors were hot alcohol, followed by dark fruits and corriander/clove.  Pretty good stuff.
"
1," SEP 13, 2011 Pours a deep brownish red. Nose and taste is of yeast, floral accents, and roasted malts. IMO a good gateway into the style.
"
1," Bit of overkill here to me. Its not as good as everyone raves about. Its far too overpowering and chemical/steel vat smells are over the top. Its flavour however were quite intense and interesting, don't know what to make of the flower bouquets...made me wanna sing ""ring a ringa up ya ringa roses""
"
1," Moderate malty aroma. Large, off white head. Good lacing. Mostly diminishing longevity. Brown body. Light sweet and moderate bitter flavor. Medium palate. Good beer I like it.
"
1," smooth, buttery and full mouthfeel.  excellent balance.  The esters translate into a lightly bitter finish with a trail of alcohol.  Flavors of almonds, bread, and citrus fruit.  Very good on tap with a proper pour.  I wouldnt rate it as high from the bottle.
"
1," Reddish brown hue with a small creamy tan head and very good lacing. The aroma has light Bourbon notes of vanilla, oak, whisky in addition to the toasty and bready malts, floral hops, current and berry fruit tones, coffee, mocha and a light spice. The taste starts fruity and tart (some lactic nature) on top of a sweet chocolate malts base. Smoky and chalky undertones which leads to a touch of the barrel aged character upon the finish. The feel is crisp yet smooth oily body. Nicely done with just a bit of the bourbon notes, would have again.
"
1," cloudy reddish brown.  big aroma of fruity malt and toffee.  smooth and filling mouthfeel.  nice complex flavour of fruit, toffee, chocolate and alcohol.
"
1," very discreet sweetness, discreet fruityness, discreet bitterness.  This still produces a largely-over-the-decent-mark brew but I much prefered the complexity and depth of taste of Westmalle Dubbel in 75cl bottle.
"
1," From the tall 1 pt. 9.4 fl. oz. bottle marked L07-221.  Pours a mahagony-ruby red tone with a puffy beige head that settles down after a moment. Sweet malts in the aroma and a little hint of fruitiness.  Medium mouth feel.  The taste was malted, slightly nutty, bitter, and with a hint of hops. A dryer finish. The alcohol is more prevalent in the flavor than in the aroma.  I understand why its gets a decent rating.  Not my style exactly but definitely a good brew.
"
1," Bottle, pours an enormous head. Pale blonde, cloudy. Clove, banana and milk in the aroma. Banana and citrus in the flavor. Nice and refreshing weizen.
"
1," Bottle. Light golden coloured wirh almost no head. Nice carbonation. Slightly malty and hoppy with a touch of caramel. A bit common though.
"
1," This was nearly the perfect beer.  Great pour, nice head that remains through the entire experience, reminding you why you picked this beverage.  Full flavors that hint of berries and spices.  Nice kick that reminds you that you must imbibe intelligently or you may be calling yellow cab.  However, it took me longer to drink this beer than any other as I wanted the experience to last forever.
"
1," Pours a hazy reddish brown with very lively effervescence.  Head was creamy off-white color, not as thick as I had hoped but had excellent lacing.  Aroma of figs, dates and cloves well intertwined with barley malts and yeast.  Flavor is similar to the aroma, yielding to a more mellow, dry and spicy finish.  The velvety rich consistency complements the dark color of the beverage.  Had this with garlic ribs on a bed of california brown rice.  Made for a very well rounded meal.
"
1," Very nice floral/citrus aroma and flavor with hops and a strong malty backbone.  This and the stout are the best from this brewer, imo.
"
1," bottle. Clear golden yellow colour, large and creamy white head. Malty-fruity nose. Solid malty body with pleasant fruit flavours throughout. Slightly more hoppy in the finish. A very pleasant Export.
"
1," I detected a sweet note in the aroma, which possibly was honey but it wasnt noticeable in the flavor.I found this easy drinking, but slightly bland
"
1," Nice strong belgian beer. Perfect fruit taste along with nice brown foam. Nice aroma. You can drink this one anywhere any time.
"
1," DEC 30, 2008 Bottle"
1," 8/12 0.33 l bottle at Hopdevil. Poured very dark brown body with moderate ocher head which lasted almost until I finished it. Fantastic natural sourish aroma of dark fruits and lot of malts. Pretty complex, with notes of caramel, meadow flowers, nuts, oak and just an introduction to alcohol. Flavor is complex and pleasant as well, nicely balanced between bitter sweet and sour, caramel, dark berry fruits and chocolate dominated with surely lot of other thing here if you extend your senses and imagination. Thick bodied, creamy on palate, you can actually eat it. Leaves perfect long sweetish finish reflecting the taste and definitely a big smile on the face, putting it into category of few best beers Ive ever tried!
"
1," [Bottle] Pours dark brown with a big light tan head. Aroma is sweet, with some light milk chocolate (kind of like a whopper), honey, and some odd vegetative notes that are a little grassy. Taste is interesting--raisin, spices (I assume cardamom?), alcohol, chocolate, quite sweet, but underlying roasted malt and some oak. Honey notes in the finish. A little too much of the ashy roasted malt towards the end, but not completely overdone like with many porters and stouts these days. Good mouthfeel, long finish. Overall, I a little split about this beer. It was interesting, I enjoyed it, especially at times. However, it was fairly busy and muddled, and I feel like some things could have been left out.
"
1," Just a really fine Belgian ale, with slightly fruity almost champagne-like character.  Complex, floral, well-balanced.
"
1," NOV 26, 2005 750ml bottle.  Tasted like caramel.  Strong taste.  Foamy head.  Nice touch, reminded me the trois-pistoles.
"
1," Pours deep ruby brown with a rich, beige head.  Fizzy carbonation.  Aroma of banana and malt, with a fine, herbal hop bouquet.  Tastes of caramel malt and alcohol with a nice hop bite.  Excellent body but finishes clean.
"
1," Notes from Indy Winterfest		Pours light hazy straw-brown.	Aroma has sweetness and corn notes.  The flavor is butterscotchy, vanilla, and rather sweet.  Palate is normal.  Overall an ok beer, not one I would seek out.
"
1," Finally, I got my hands on the venerable Chimay Bleu and I wondered why I waited so long.  This did not disappoint.  Rich brown color with a thick, frothy off-white head.  Initially spicy and nutty with underlying sweet maltiness.  A world class brew.  Unfortunately, I chilled it a little much although I took nearly 45 minutes to finish it off. It warmed considerably and the true flavor and aroma came through.  Darn, now I have to try it again to get it right from start to finish!
"
1," AUG 20, 2007 big bottle"
1," Not as good as I had hoped.  I was disappointed.  I liked the fruity aspects of the beer, but overall it was just missing something.  It was unbalanced.  However, this tasted kind of like a hybrid between a wine and a beer.  Im not so sure I liked that either.  It is definately a good beer worth trying, but it definately doesnt live up to the hype.  Definately not worth $6 for a 12 ounce bottle either.
"
1," While I have found the experience of drinking a Chimay enjoyable, the product itself I believe to be somewhat overrated IMO. The beer is well done, no doubt. But there are better examples of this style. Anyways, on to the review. The aroma was fruity sweet, spicy, although not very complex. Appearance was a nice copper color that looked very nice in my glass. Mouthfeel was a bit fizzy and hot. Flavors werent too deep either with notes of caramel, dark fruit, some hops and malty sweet. Enjoyable, but like the Chimay Blue, a tad overrated.
"
1," FEB 3, 2007 Initial appearance is the beautiful copper coloured beer with a white frothy head,it shouts..""Drink Me!""	It has a nice rounded fruity, maltly flavour and a slightly sour after taste.	You can tell its an abbey beer,but this has to be my favourite one so far - Totally Delicious!!!
"
1," The quality is unsurpassed, and the fact it is available in more and more fine establishments is a testament to its appeal.
"
1," Bottle at home, from my Maudite glass. Pours clear pale gold, 1-finger white head, good lacing. Nose is spicy hops, some tropical fruit, something cheesy in there too, along with a certain bubblegum notes. Odd... Flavours of Spicy canteloupe and bizarre spicy hop-mess. This is really all over the place. Abort! ABORT!!!!!!!

1," Full bodied. Malty, some fruitiness (apple, blackcurrant). Bitter finish. Very well brewed and delicious beer, but lacks in taste and complexity compared to a Rochefort.
"
1," Bottle pour to Chimay glass gives dark root beer color with off-white head that disappears quickly.  Minimal lacing.  Aroma faintly fruity - I really didnt get a good sense of it.  Taste is its strong point - dark fruits, chocolate, caramel, yeast, sweet malts nicely proportioned.  Alcohol apparent but not overpowering.  Finish smooth.  medium palate, Id like just a bit more thickness.		Nice but I was a little underwhelmed given the high scores.
"
1," MAY 24, 2003 Dark red, huge off white head. Sweet aroma of caramelized sugar, fruit, touch of cloves, orange blossom, bit of bell pepper spice,  and smoke on the finish. Sweet flavor with a touch of alcohol and herbelness. A little over carbed for my liking, but a lot of malty goodness.
"
1," Chimay Premire leaves a reddish brown beer in the glass, slightly hazy with not much carbonation. The creamy head is thick and beige. It leaves a nice lacing on the glass when dissapearing very slowly.		Aroma"
1," REALLY GREAT RED BEER.  THIS BEER IS BEAUTIFUL FULL OF BODY AND HAS A GREAT HEAD.  VERY SMOOTH AND GOES DOWN EASY
"
1," Tried on tap at the Florida Brew Fest 2011 addition. It pours deep copper  amber with thin mocha head. The aroma is a modest level of bitter pine hops, caramel malts and a bit of caramel kettlization caramel like candy. The taste starts off on the thin side but likely pretty good for a Pale Ale offering up caramel malts, crystal malts and modest levels of pine hop flavor and bitterness. The malts fade while the hops remain pretty consistent in strength right into the finish.

"
1," Dark copper color with a large head that falls rather quickly.  Initially a strong citrus hop aroma, but now way more dank than anything.  Strong bitterness.  Plenty of resin/pine/dank.  Light caramel and biscuit notes, but not enough to distract from the hop centerpiece.  Medium mouthfeel.  Pretty tasty!
"
1," Bottle from Swedish ""Systembolaget"".Brown color, brown head. Belgian beer scent. Very metallic taste.I love the Blue Chimay, but the red one is just not glass of beer at all.
"
1," White wax dipped, 12oz bottle.  Red pour.  Raisin aroma.  Nice fruit.  Dry flavor.  Some fruit, lots of hops.  Medium bodied.  	My 1900th USA Rating.
"
1," Its warm golden with a creamy, white head and the aroma has notes of malt, straw and flower. The flavour has a light sweetness and notes of malt, straw, flower and the finish is dry and refreshing.
"
1," Dark brown body with little head.  Flavour is nice and nutty but a little thin.  Finish is dry.
"
1," Bottled 0.33l from Presporska pivoteka, Bratislava. Dark copper color with light brown head. Aroma caramel, plums, and roasted grain. Taste, dried fruit, citrus, malt, hint of chocolate, lon bittersweet finish. Not my favorite Chimay beer, but still nice beer.
"
1," Dark copper colour with red ambar tones. Sweet aroma. Taste is caramel, malty and the typical chimay yeast. Fresh and citric. A little bit overcarbonatated. Too much fizz tends to ruin a beer, but this one is very good.
"
1," 25 ounce bottle.  Pours a nice red-amber color with a good siezed beige head that lasts.  Taste is fruity and yeasty, while the aroma is fruity and of caramel.  Has a pretty good mouthfell, that makes me want more.  Overall, this is a pretty excellent beer as it is rather tasty, easy to drink, and for the quality it is priced fairly (About $4.75 per 25 ounce bottle).  Also, I like the bottle and label design.
"
1," Beautiful copper color, fizzy head, very satisfying. Aroma is fruity, as most trappists are, with clean, sweet finish. Very Nice!
"
1," BottleSmall white fizzy head that was mostly lasting, decent amount of lacing, visible carbonation, hazy, and an orange brown hue. Nose was sweet, caramel, malty, citrusy, grapefruit, and hops. Flavor was malty, caramel, sweet, and hoppy. Nicely done. Mouthfeel was hoppy. Medium body. Very drinkable and worthy of a try.
"
1," Cask (gravity dispense), at the Flowerpot, Derby, July 2005. Copper colour. Malty, with some smoky notes. the malt is rather biscuity. Not a lot of hop presence, but this is an Irish ale (maybe). Smooth mouthfeel. A solid, if uninspired beer.
"
1," Bottle, picked up in Chattanooga.  Poured clear reddish-caramel with a medium cap of beige head.  The aroma picked up sweet candied caramel and darker fruits with dusty floral accents.. sweeter overall and quite nice.  The flavor had sweet caramel at the core with floral and medium-skinned fruity bitterness.. very sweet at the back-end, and quite bitter.  Lighter-bodied on the palate and quite bitter with an artificial aire to the sweetness.. felt OK.
"
1," A golden beer with a disappearing white head. The aroma is malty with notes of caramel. The flavor is sweet malty with notes of caramel and straw and the end is dry and somewhat bitter. An OK beer with out being special.

1, Ruby red with almost no head. Liquid is quite clear.		Aroma
1," Reminds me of a shallower chimay bleu. Malty and nice, but Id never buy it next to the blue.
"
1," The fresh yeast, the pleasent taste that lasts and lasts on your palate....heaven in a glass - one of my favorites.
"
1," Bottle at Paps.	Clear golden coloured with a medium sized white head.	Fruity aroma of hops and grass with notes of caramel.	Malty flavour of hops and grass with notes of caramel.	Dry hoppy finish.
"
1," Sampled at brewpub. Pours a murky yellow with a thin head and some lacing. Aroma is of clove and coriander with some citrus. Malt seems funky. Taste is flooded with orange and coriander. Crisp finish with a slightly bready aftertaste. Not bad.
"
1," Bottle 50cl from Quack-Duck thanks ! A cloudy amber-orange beer with medium head. Nose is caramel like with vinous hints. Aroma is malty, slightly sour, diacetyl notes, peppery hops. Quite strong bitterness, grassy and dry, overriped fruit notes at the finish, quite unbalanced.
"
1," Light crisp aroma, not as strong as I would expect.  Rich, fully bodied mahogony color.  Sweet caramel taste with a smooth aftertaste and pleasant bite.  It has a slightly hazelnut tint that rolls into the caramel and out very smoothly.
"
1," Softer in flavor to Blue. One of my personal favorates. Well balanced and a great ale. Highly recommended.
"
1," MAY 9, 2009 12oz - Aroma is roasted dark malts, chocolate, dry cocoa, vanilla and a touch of oak.  Pours black with a small ring head and good lacing.  Flavor is thick with chocolate followed by vanilla and roasted malts.  Palate is dry.  Very tasty.
"
1," When money allows I want to try this side by side with the grande reserve. I was a bit less impressed with this, however I feel that I need to try it again to do a fair comparison. Screw this comparison crap...how does it stand alone? Well, this was rather malty and nicely fruity. Like its blue labeled sibling this wonderful beer has undertones of currant and apricot but has an appealing maltiness that is all its own. (Im comparing and contrasting again arent I) I didnt catch the touch of bitterness described above, I actually thought this was incredibly smooth and was rather impressed with its lack of bitterness being so attractive to its overall flavor.
"
1," Bottle 50cl. w. swing top @ [ Chris Os pre NYE Tasting ].Clear light to medium yellow orange color with a average to large, frothy to creamy, good lacing, mostly lasting, off-white to white head. Aroma is moderate malty, hay, toasted, molasses. Flavor is moderate sweet and light bitter with a average duration. Body is medium to light, texture is watery to oily, carbonation is soft. [20081230]
"
1," This is one of the beers that I started to drink when I got back into micro/craft beers.  That I now barely ever drink it says a lot to what I look for when buying beers.  This is still a nice option when there isnt a lot of other selection at a store/bar.  Pours a dark redish-brown, aroma is sweet, taste is somewhat sweet and the alcohol is well hidden.  I still like this one but I am glad I am rating it now rather then when I first started with Belgian Strongs - Id have given this too high of a rating.
"
1," Piss colored topped by a medium thick head with a good amount of lacing.  Its slightly sweet with nice clove notes, a little banana and a touch of yeast.  Light bodied, crisp and slightly tingly.
"
1," FEB 21, 2011 pours pale brown-reddish. caramel malts, toffee-like, nuts and spicy, peppery (abbaye de scourmonts distinctive yeast). average carbonation. light body. very dry finish, leafy hops. classic and good!
"
1," Deep golden coloured, quite stable creamy off-white head; rather hoppy-aromatic nose, backed by shy sweet-malt; solid dryish bitter flavour with a delicate sweetness detectable, light to medium-bodied; lingering dry bitter finish. A perfect franconian session beer..........
"
1," Draft. Poured a clear copper color with an average frothy off-white head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Solid toasted malt aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium balanced nutty sweet flavor with the same smooth finish of average duration. Better than my expectations.
"
1," Dark mahogany with big, foamy brown head / Rich nose of vanilla, coconut, and cocoa / Medium to full body, malty with good hop balance, and fair finish / Somewhat overbearing flavors of coconut, oak, and vanilla with notes of cocoa and roast barley / Made with too heavy a hand.
"
1," Swing top bottle, from MoritzF. Thanks! Light golden color, slightly hazy. Malt, flowery hops and a touch of vanilla in the aroma. Hoppy, malty, flowery flavor with a persistant flowery aftertaste. Fresh and delicious.
"
1," 33cl bottle Nose is of caramelly malt with a little apricots; Hazy rusty amber body with a little bit of an off-white head. Flavor is of caramel with a little hop bitterness and more hops in the finish
"
1," Bottle bought @ Systembolaget and consumed on October 3. Pours deep brown with a big fizzy brownish head. Smell is sweet and yeasty. I can detect some notes of sourdough bread. Taste is sweet and malty with plums and raisins. There is liquorice and caramel with some yeast, alcohol and hints of sour cherries.
"
1," Had a 75cl bottle. Brown colour, with some red touches and an average, off white head. Sweet aroma, light caramal hints and fruity-spicy. Full body with a creamy finish, light bitter. Very good beer, I love it.
"
1, Fairly-dark brown with some reddish streaks. Decent head.		S
1," Pretty damn good!		This is probably the best of the three available Chimay ales. pours a nice dark amber hue with good bubble-gum-ish fruity flavors. This was my first trappist ale! glad I tried it!
"
1," Clear golden with a medium white head. Sweet aroma with lemons and hints of lime. Flavour was sweet with lemons, lime and aspartam. Finished sweet.
"
1," Bottle. Appearance is light amber and copper colored with an inch of thin, fluffy head. Aroma is sharp and yeasty with strong fruit tart fragrances suggesting cranberries and apricots. Taste begins with toasted caramel malts and cloves followed by a strong, doughy spiced yeast presence. It has a smooth and dry finish with some hints of brown sugar and rum. Theres a slightly bitter clove aftertaste. Smooth and tasty with a relatively low ABV for a Belgian.
"
1," Belgian yeast aroma, candied sugar, wisps of dark fruits. Bubbly, airy body. Light but loaded with dark fruits, rum like alcohol, cottony malts and sharp yeast. Hints of flaked maize or toasted malts. Light body beneath the airy nature. Flavors are sublime, but not melded well and there is no distinctive flavor that makes me swoon. Mellows a bit as it sits and warms. Yeast pour, thankfully not tremendous, adds depth of body and a light sourness. Amplifies the cottony malt quality. Fruitiness increases as well. Mid ground on the sweet-dry front.
"
1," Very dark. with a very big head. oce i started drinking it i couldnt put it down. highly recommended!
"
1," My comments on the ""Blue"" follow ( the ""Red"" is almost there) ... Blue -Just a superb Trappist rendition.  I love the yeasty fullish bodied content, the red-copper color, the Belgian lace and overtones of malted caramel among other enticing flavors.  The best of the Chimay line.
"
1," Bottled. A nut-brown beer wiht a thin beige head. The aroma has notes of straw, malt, metal, and alcohol. The flavor is sweet with notes of malt, caramel, alcohol, and bread, leading to a dry, bitter, and alcoholic finish.
"
1," Grand Slam at the Beer Fest in the Poconos.  The aroma a bit roasty malt and spice.  Heady with a dark brown color.  Flavor is complex with sweet and smooth.  Roasty, sweet, bitter, and fizzy all at once and all in a sensible way.  Nice silky carbonation, very smooth.  Masterful.
"
1," Beer number 23 in the Great Ayr/ Glasgow pub crawl. Cask in Blackfriars. Very Dark Brown. Aroma fruity, caramel. Thin mouthfeel. Slightly acidic finish. Dunno about this one. Will rate again when sober!
"
1," CASK AT maltnhops Leith, Golden Yellow, light fruit hop nose ... bit citrus hit ... smooth and simple with light lemon tones... very fresh... quite drying in linger.
"
1," bottle thanks to blutt59.  poured a light brown with an off-white head.  aroma of caramel, spice, cinnamon, and grains.  flavor was caramel, citrus, spice and cinnamon.  light body with high carbonation.
"
1," Draft. Pours amber brown with a beige head. Lightly roasted malty aroma with some caramel sweet malts. The flavor is generally mild, with sweet malts, chocolate, and light toasted malts. Pretty good.
"
1," 12oz. bottle. Hey,my Dads catching on, hes putting stuff like this in his fridge. Ive learned that Pre-Pro beers were first to use corn as an adjunct, but this one is all malt. And the malt shows up in the nose and taste. Light brown color of a Pre-Pilsener, too, reminded me of a Yuengling. Full on malt taste, with the spice of mainly German hops, followed by those piny American types. I may be rating this higher than others, but I think this is a fine ""common"" lager with no flaws.
"
1," wow, what a treat after a big day of beer sampling.  Aroma is filled with fruits-apicots, pears, apples, and grapes-appearance was dark ruby red with a off white rocky head that lasted forever-lots of carbonation.  palate was sweet, what you would expect from a belgian strong ale.  this was not my style of beer that i usually drink, but it was excellent!!!!!
"
1," SEP 10, 2007 Wow, this is an excellent beer!  Pours a deep dark brown with a tan head and tastes great.  Despite what the reviewers before me say it is not overpowing at all, its as easy to drink as a pale lager.  I like it enough to make a two way tie, along with the Rogue Shakespear, as my favorite beer.  Now this one co-riegns with an iron fist.  My only regret was that I didnt buy the big bottle.  I drank it out of a tumbler.
"
1," NOV 6, 2011 I fear my bottle may be skunked. It totally volcanoed out of the bottle when I cracked it open and it smells like apple juice. Nonetheless it tastes pretty good, if not amazing.
"
1," darker pour, sweet malty flavor.  pretty much the same rating as the white, its been said 750+ times on this beer, so i dont feel the need to reiterate all of that.  its a damn fine beer, and if you see one, buy it to try it.
"
1," Ultimately disappointing.  On the nose some sweet malt but also a nasty whiff of alcohol.  There is some fruit & malt & sweetness on the rounded palate but then the flavours disappear into a chalky dryness leaving you feeling the whole thing is a little thin & unbalanced.  The final flavour is a fairly pleasant spiced fruit but by then its too late.
"
1," I love it strong wonderful flavor with a pale ale llook. the taste is a mallty beer, with a sweet plum taste.
"
1," Quite an enjoyable brew I enjoyed this beer enough to have started to lay down vintages for years to come, the only thing that will spoil the beer is my self tasting them before due age.
"
1," This really is a top notch beer.  I have the red, the white, and now the blue.  I loved the complexity of this beer and how the yeast and malt really come together on the tip your tongue.  The aftertaste was lingering and sweet and perfect.  Excellent Belgian Strong.
"
1," Cask@GBBF2011. Golden colour, small white head. Aroma is qwood, some mild malts, mild sulphur as well as some slight floral notes. Flavour is fruity, floral, grassy, herbal and quite earthy as well. Quite wooden and fruity bitter in the finish.
"
1," Draught at the brewpub. Citric aroma. Almost clear amber colour. Big semi-stable off-white head. The flavour starts off semi-sweet, turns a bit more hoppy. Good maltiness. Rough hoppiness. Caramel finish, not entirely clean, but OK. Rough carbonation.
"
1," If there is a beeter beer out there I have not had it.  The beer poors a dark brown so you expect it to be heavy.  I still can't believe how smooth and perfect this beer was.
"
1," 330 ml bottle, best before 2009, so I gather this one is very fresh (bottled in 2004).  Dark reddish brown beer with a very thick, sticky, and lasting tan-coloured head.  Sweet and spicy aroma with loads of plummy fruit, dark molasses, and faint cherry fruitiness in the nose.  The flavour is quite spicy, reminding me of a subdued version of the Unibroue yeast.  Yeasty notes mingle nicely with brown sugar, toast, molasses and dried plums and cherries.  Full-bodied beer as well.  There is quite a bit more bitterness in this bottle than I expected, although I suspect that as it ages this will diminish.  Id like to try it when its been aged out for 3-4 years.
"
1," Pours a lighter shade of brown, with medium head. Tastes of roasted malts, raisins, and a hint of citris. Little or no lacing. Very enjoyable and a refreshing bubbly aftertaste.
"
1," 750ml. bottle from Trinity Liquors in Spring Hill, FL. Aroma of light floral notes, citrus, alcohol...not a very strong aroma. Pours cloudy cream soda color with a thin white head. Flavor is light malt, citrus, flowers, yeast...Nice mouthfeel...Its pretty good...not nearly as good as the Chimay Blue or White.
"
1,  mild bitter sweet grain with generic hop character.5+	Appearance
1," Nice maltiness.  Very smooth and clean.  An enjoyable lager, but nothing outstanding.
"
1," The color is the same golden as apple-juice and the head is white. The aroma has notes of the peal of grapefruit and lime. The flavour is artificially sweetened and tastes like it, and it has notes of citrus, mostly lemon, and the finish is slightly dry and sweet.
"
1," Extra Bottle. Pours a black body with a tan head.  Vanilla and bourbon woody notes with some lighter chocolate undertones and a light roast y finish.  Nice brew.
"
1," Light brown with little head. Very strong caramel flavor. Smooth and sweet. While I am not a big fan of sweet beers, this was a favorite.
"
1," Bottle.  Sweet  apricot malt and light astringent alcohol aroma.  Cloudy orange-brown color with moderate head.  Very sweet apricot malt and moderately bitter/astringent alcohol flavor.   Pretty good but very sweet.

0," In bottle at beer school. Bright amber color. Smells like... Musty chocolate, in a good way. ?? Tastes... Like a lager.

1," Pours dark copper color with frothy, ariy, bubbleish, beige head, what is fading into a small ring.	Aroma"
1," Nothing wrong with this beer. If you like Belgian beers this is a must.
"
1," Thanks to the Tampa Tasting Group for sharing this one.  Pours caramel brown with an off-white head.  Nose is malt, caramel, candy sugar, some yeast, and some spice.  Flavor is similar with candy sugar, booze, and some yest and pepper.  Lingering yeast and candy sugar with lingering raisin flavor.  Interesting beer.
"
1," Dark copper body with a thin, white head. Strong caramel aroma with a bit of citrus. Similar flavor, not bad. More balanced, less bitter.
"
1," Bottle thanks to thirdeye11. Pours with a black body and a fading brown head. Aroma of barrel, alcohol, chocolate and vanilla icing. Taste is coffee, chocolate, wet wood and a bit of dark fruit. Light bubbles, thin body for a barrel aged stout.
"
1," 11-12-07 bottle shared with lb4lb big thanks to tytoanderso. 		Black with a nice thick head.  Smells like a coffee shop.  Rich roasted coffee taste.  Flavor isnt as developed as I would like - but not horrible by any means.  A bit of a burnt toasty taste up front.  And finishes with a buttery taste.  Not very creamy at all on the palate though.
"
1," bottle, thank you frankenland. Clear amber colour, large beige head. Fruity-malty nose. Full-bodied, pleasantly malty with some hints of caramel and roasetd malts, fruity with a shy sourness in the background. Well-balanced. An enjoyable beer.
"
1," JUN 13, 2004 Beautifull head, it remains quite thick. Spicy smell. Complex taste, malt, spices, fruits. Soft aftertaste with hints of alcohol.	#Rerate May 1, 2003. After having sampled 1983, '88, '93, '97, '99, '00, '01, '02, '03 and the Millenium Edition. The older the beer, the more fruitier, the more port-like and certainly more alcoholic. After 10 years of aging there isn't much taste-change anymore. After about half a year - year the beer is so much fuller of taste; it's a waste to drink rather new chimays. Just let them rest for a while. The Millenium edition isn't great imo compared with the '99 and '00 editions; it's a bit more muffy and superficial. My rating is based on the 3-4 year old chimays. 	Rerate june 2004. This beer is great as described above but it is certainly not a 4.9 as I rated this one before.
"
1," Large bottle - Amber brown/red colour, tiny head, aroma of dark fruit and malt, flavour of malt and spices yet a hint of sourness, not a bad beer but I prefer the rest of the range
"
1," Can it get any better than this??
"
1," Deep amber hue, nearly black, and with a dark, tanned head. Warm, nutty, malted roasty aroma. The body is candi-malted with sweet burnt caramel, and bubblegum chewy perforations. Decent, but atypical for a stout.
"
1," Bottle.  Cocoa, iced coffee, and malt aroma.  Dark brown with a thin head.  Raisin and toffee malt flavor with a light licorice finish.  Fairly solid Belgian ale.
"
1," FEB 10, 2009 Bottle.	Reddish-orange color. With amber and copper tinges.  Smells like plum and alcohol.  Initial taste has cherry flavored notes which are highly pleasant.  Alcohol begins to come out immediately and does not overpower.  Body is medium and there is a round flavor on the palate throughout.  It warms very very nicely and many more plum, cherry and other fruit notes are apparent.  Ends with a nice yeasty alcohol taste, that leaves a bit more to be desired body wise (I finished mine very quickly) but other than this, no complaints.  Rerate, blind dubbel tasting.  I sure dont remember this one being this full and flavorful, but wow. My friend and I both picked this one as our favorite (and best of style) hands down.  Ripe red fruits, soft cherry cola, medium dark malts, bubbly palate and a wonderful yeastiness.  The fruit was fabulous though and really put this one on top.  Great stuff and its nice to revisit a chimay and find it better than remembered.
"
1," Draught at Sailor HagarsGolden color; creamy head. The aroma is lightly fruity, at least this one has some aroma, from Sailor Hagars. The mouthfeel is quite dry, but there is a good toffee flavor, a very strong bitterness, with a good share of hop oils and resins, and bitter orange peel. Solid.
"
1," THIS IS MY 100th BEER!!  Thank you thank you.  You all have been so supportive...I would like to thank all the influences in my life to get me to this point.  First of all I would like to thank God for making malt, barely, and monks.  My college for showing me how NOT to drink beer, and most of all my dad (the esteemed kumite_56) for showing me the right way to enjoy beer and opeining up the vast and complex world of beer...and mostly his refridgerator to me.  		So yes, this was a good beer...Nice foamy beige head with lovely lacing (you know I love that lacing).  Spicey floral hops, (dark) fruit but not citrus.  Sweet carmelly malt backbone with a slight alcoholic flavor.  A spicey peppery bitting finish at the end.  Quite nice.  The flavor demands a heavier palate than the Blue had.  Keep this one on hand for a treat after long cold day.  		Cheers  everyone.
"
1," Pours a dark frothy amber.  Smells great, like a red wine  I cant wait to dig in!  Tastes like sun dried fruits, mostly rasin.  Delicious.
"
1," Bottle from West Lakeview, Chicago.  Opaque black with medium creamy tan head.  Aroma is roasted malt, smoke, cherry or other sweet red fruit though the beer itself is very sweet in the aroma.  Roasted malt with slight smoke which is not as strong as the aroma, with definite oat characteristics and that same sort of cherry-like fruit.  Body begins medium and creamy but drops out at the end like a deflated balloon with the same sort of rubberiness.  Very nice all around but is missing and extra something or another to be perfect.
"
1," A fine beer, true, but overrated.  Not much in the way of aromas (fruity esters, to be sure, but muted).  Silky smooth.  Copper colored.  Nicely bodied with just a hint of astringency.  Good, but there are better .........
"
1," 750ml bottle - pours deep red/brown with a big off-white head. Sweet, dark fruits in the nose - dates, plums, and then the yeast. This trappist has a mildly sour vinous quality to it, with a foamy, fluffy, frothy mouthfeel that makes it very easy to drink. Well carbonated. Velvety smoothness coats the mouth and throat...really pleasant. Some spiciness, more fruits, and a light bitterness in the finish. Great beer that I drink quite regularly. Perhaps my favourite of the Chimay offerings.
"
1," Bottle. Malty aroma, light sweet and light smell of chocolate. No head, the body is red and clear. The taste is light bitter and malty. The body is medium stron, light creamy and with a soft carbonation.
"
1," Coppery and hazy colour with a very compact thick white head. Light but nice aroma of hop and caramalt. Medium bodied. Very nice aftertaste.
"
1," 2001. tasted at Plan B 10/3-2007. Deep and intens brownish with slight ywllowish head. Lots of prune, figs, cherry and quit nutty. Almonds and hazelnut. Medium body and still very complex.
"
1," Naked and hazy orange-brown body. Smell of sweet malts and fruit. Sweet grainy malts in flavour with a nicely, but moderate, bitterness to the tail. Masked alcohol. Dry in the mouth and quite easy to drink (Cask, sample at GBBF 06.08.2009).
"
1," Chimay red cap is full-bodied and slightly sweet with a hint of berries and also has one of the best aftertastes of any beer to be found!
"
1," (bottle, from pivnizub) Clear, pale golden colour with a medium-sized, slowly lacing foamy white head. Sweet and grainy aroma with hay and shy herbal hoppy notes, also with a minimal fruity touch. Initially quite sweet malty, slightly grainy taste with a herbal background that gets stronger towards the dry and moderately bitter finish. A bit slim but drinkable, easy-going Pils.
"
1," Hazy brown pour with one finger of tan head. Rich malty aroma with a hint of hops. Malty roasted grain flavors with hints of chocolate and coffee  just hints - dominate the start, with a decent, although one dimensional, hops bite coming through in the finish. A thoroughly respectable ale.
"
1," Courtesy of Matta.	<P>	Chocolate malt and lots of oak in the aroma. Extremely woody smelling. Deep black with a huge mocha head. Fore is again quite oaky and runs through all flavor ranges along with a smooth chocolate flavor and hints of vanilla, cream and bourbon.
"
1," Pours a deep brown with a tall, tan and creamy head that really hangs around through the entire drink. Strong nutty nose, mild hint of chocolate, very light dark fruity finish. Flavor starts with a great nutty and chocolate combination that adds in a light vanilla in the middle and finishes with a very light raising and plum fruitiness at the finish. The brew has a pretty dense feeling with low, fine carbonation that lends a pretty nice creamy feeling.  The glass has perfect lacing layers left on it after each glass. Overall a very tasty brew thats very well rounded and probably one of the best brown ales I have had the pleasure of rating.
"
1," All we can really do is thank the monks that brew this one. Great, lasting head, wonderful, fruity aroma. Warm, slightly banana-like and alcoholic aftertaste. Enjoy.
"
1," Light medium body, nothing special, malty fizzing, hops a bit oxidized, still not much true character, too effervescent
"
1," Bottle at Long Room. Not sure why its been so long, but Im finally trying it. Pours a ruddy reddish brown with dissipating head. Nose is cherries, phenols and dusty malts. Some light prunes and spice as well. Also some green apple. On taste, the clovey phenolics come across first, spicy, followed by the apple and cherry notes. Not particularly complex. Definitely not my favorite. Okay.
"
1," Rust colored pour with a large rocky off-white head.  Soft dark fruit aroma with faint candi sugar, alcohol, pepper, banana, and slight green apple.  Apple cider flavor with notes of plum and spice.  Dry medium body with lots of carbonation.
"
1," Bottle @ Home. pours amber with a small white head. Aroma of caramel, sweet fruit, yeast. Taste of fruit, chocolate,nuits, carqamel, raisins, brown sugar. Medium to full body, soft carbonation, creamy mouthfeel. Very good.
"
1," Pours a clear deep golden with a rich and lacing off-white head. Amazingly fresh and citrusy hop aroma. Medium body, a little sweet fruit but the dry and pretty astringent Citra hops dominate. Very astringent finish
"
1," Bottle at Cruzat. December 2006. Pours a nice redish brown color with some ruby hues and a big, rocky, dune like light tan head. Aroma is yeast, some coffee. Taste is roasty, toast, some slight cocoa, some bitter chocolate. Mouthfeel is medium to light. A faint aftertaste of cigarettes?? Quaffable porter.
"
1," Really, really great beer. I was rather disappointed with Chimay Red since I didnt like the too-light texture. Chimay Bleu ,however, has a brilliant texture and is wonderfully thick, has the most beautiful aroma my nose has ever sensed and a taste and texture that will likely soon replace food in my meals. The taste is so wonderfully complex redolent of fruit. Very filling as well, more so even then my favorite beer guinness which this might replace if I oculd find it more often. Couldnt give this a perfect score just because its not guinness - but al in all a brilliant beer.

1," Reddish brown and somewhat cloudy in both color and appearance. Creamy, well maintained off white head. Sharp burnt/smoky aroma and flavor with a pronounced alcohol mouthfeel. Interesting  yet undeterminable after taste which I assume to be juniper. Moderate carbonation. Its the opportunity to experience such rare treasures like this that make life so rewarding. Many thanks to Per.
"
1," From a 330 ml bottle. Commercial description has it about right, color is appealing brown, the head itself taste pretty good. Overall the beer is pretty sweet, caramelic and pleasant with an enjoyable bitterness that pops in right on time. Complex and easy to drink for a trappist. Pure quality.
"
1," MAY 12, 2009 750ml bottle. with 11/05 on the cork.		Pours a slightly hazy, very dark garnett, with a one finger head that settles slowly to a thick cap. The lacing is very thick and sticky, completely covering the interior on the glass.		Smell; a bit more subdued than I was expecting, but there are some dark fruits with a little bit of a dusty yeastiness.		Taste; much better that the aroma. Very fruity with some figs, currants, dates and plums. Caramel and cinammon, with a little touch of pepper are present, as well as some cloves.		Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, which is a bit thinner than I expected, especially considering the higher abv, and the drinkability is pretty darn good.		Oddly enough, this is the first time Ive ever had the Grand Reserve (I first had the Premiere about 11 years ago). While this is a good one, there are better, and much cheaper ones to be had.
"
1," Dark pour with a brown crown of deliciousness.  I have to thank Optigon again for this, that dude is one hell of a trader.  I would never have tried an oatmeal stout otherwise.  I loved this brew.  Roasted malt, chocolate, lingering flavor on the palate and not overly thick as you would think.  Very good.
"
1," Really nice - complex fruit flavor - very smooth and thick, like a ale-milkshake.  Cloudy - very enjoyable.
"
1," Another one of my favorite Beligum beers.   reddish brown in color.  Very smooth and consistent flavor
"
1," Dark ruby, hazy but not as murky as i remember, not a big head... aroma of pitted fruits and belgian yeast... flavor has a minimal smokiness baconlike with big notes of belgian yeast candi sugar and more pit fruits... remarkably dry finish...
"
1," bottle poured into tulip glass. certainly a strong grainy aroma, but it wasnt my favorite sensation for this beer. The appearance was good, but not great. The taste was excellent though, thick slick, spicy, and full bodied with aslightly bitter malty finish
"
1," Bottle pours a murky brown color, aroma of molasses and metallic notes as well as some complex spicy fruits.  Taste is a lot the same, weird metallic taste, not the raisin alcohol taste youd expect, very sweet though.  Medium to full bodied, average carbonation, with sweet molasses finish.  Definitely lives up to the hype.

1," JAN 18, 2009 	Date"
1," This was the big winner out of the sampler.  Worthy of a whole pint.  Lots of big chocolate and coffee flavors.  Very smooth creamy and easy to drink.
"
1," an odd orangish brown pour w/ a big thick white head that laces pretty well nice champagne like bubbles but dissapates quickly nocking it from a potential 5 in appearance.  A scent that is yeasty cloves, cinnamon, fruitiness very sweet hints of apricot or bannana in it as well.  Palate is highly carbonated medium bodied.  flavor is sweet and a touch spicy very fruity and malty defintelly belgian yeast almost over carbonated.  Overall a decent beer.
"
1," Bottled (BB 10/2009)	Thanks Bjrn!	Golden color, small white head. Papery, cardboardish, sticky nose. Grassy, harsh, cardboardish flavor. Harsh.
"
1," One of the truly great brews. Period. A must try. Period. Any attempt to describe its flavor (especially by analogy to other consumables) will come up at lest a bit short.
"
1," Medium body. Moderately fruity. Tasted slightly cherry. Beer is deep brown with quickly diminishing head. Had one of the lil boddles. I thought it would be richer.
"
1," Pale greenish-golden, clear, small persistent foamy layer; grainy to sweet pale-malty nose with some grassy spots; moderate sweet-bitter flavour, almost medium bodied; moderate to robust grainy-bitter finish with a light, but fresh wave of aromatic hops in the aftertaste. Solid drink......
"
1," Cask (gravity dispense) at Egham Beer Festival on 21 April 2011. A copper coloured best bitter. Clean, dry mouthfeel. Quite traditional in style - rather earthy UK hops and dry, biscuity malts. Very competent but didnt make that much of an impression. To be fair, it was the last beer of the day and supped rather quickly  to allow me to catch the last train out. Flagged for re-rate in more leisurely circumstances.
"
1," Bottle.  Pours golden with thin white head.  Aroma smells like a fraternity house floor on a Saturday AM after a Friday night band party.  Taste is like the 18 beers I had while at the party.  Taste like normal marco brewed beers.
"
1," Strong, almost synthetic banana aroma. Medium hazy amber. Dough, pepper and banana flavors. Tart, with a quick finish. Drinkable, but nothing special.
"
1,"  Bottle. BBE Dec 04.  This doesn't taste fresh. It's a typical pasteurised bottle product. It has a dead leather look about it. Aroma is of a vintage ale - musty cardboard. Fairly flat, though there is some light carbonation. Heavy oily hops mingle well with neutral pale malt to produce a muddy flavour that never distinquishes itself, but certainly has a certain oomph. You know there's flavour here, but it's not delicate, it's not fresh, and it aint that grand.
"
1," on tap - Italia Beer Festival (Milan) - pours hazy golden color with a small frothy, white head. Aroma was of banana, cream, and vanilla although there was a strange hint of boiled veg in there as well. Luckily this didnt carry over to the taste. Nothing spectacular about this Weiss but not that bad either very drinkable.
"
1," Pours a dark brown, aroma is the fruity belgian yeast with some bread notes flavor is sweet plum like with the slightest hop bitterness overall a good beer
"
1," Coffee colored with a ring of head. Feint, roasty nose. Flavor is  is much fuller. Roasty, clean, coffee essence. Altogether lovely.
"
1," My first rating... A very nice beer, one of the first belgain beers that I had to drink. In Co. Galway, strange that. 		A fine beer none the less.
"
1," Draft-Big River-Chattanooga, TN. A small sized tan head that contained fine-small bubbles that mostly diminished. The body was uncarbonated and opaque with a dark brown hue. The nose was that of mild coffee and it had a mild coffee and a little note of chocolate with a slight aftertaste to it. The mouthfeel was fairly smooth and this beer was medium bodied. Not one of the better Porter beers that I have rated.
"
1," Gold pour with a watery white head. Sour corn and light caramel malt. Sweet malt and perfumy hops. Light medium bodied and fizzy. Not much but not bad.
"
1," Gravity cask @ Reading Beer Festival 2006. Sweet malt and some fruity apple. Fairly mild flavoured on the whole but with some astringency on odd flavours towards the end.
"
1," Pours a nice dark brown color with a thick head. Takes a while for the head to go away. A nice roasty malt flavor with a similar taste. Not my style, but a decent beer.
"
1," Mmmmm! I love this beer! If I had the money, id drink it every day! 750ml, 08 bottle. Poured into Chimay goblets for the full experience. Beaut amber/ruby colour, with nice tan head. Nice complex flavours of yeast, alcohol, dried fruit (figs?), caramel... mmm.
"
1," 11 oz. bottle.  Very smooth, didnt expect that at all.  Strong, enjoyable.  Fruit flavor, and deffinately a ale to enjoy for a long time.
"
1," APR 15, 2011 Bottle@SomePub, Apr 2011, 3.5"
1," Cloudy, rusty brown.  Nice white fluffy head.  Plum, raisin, malt, caramelized sugars.  More of the same for taste with old hops and a metallic twang.  Bubbly, dry.  Very nice drinkable Belgian.
"
1," 12-oz. Thanks, um...Sprinkle? Pantanap? Man, I gotta start writing this stuff down. Anyway, my gratitude is sincere, and I love ya both, even if my memory is a little foggy. Nearly jet black with a decent, surging, creamy dark tan head. Roasty, dark nose. Creamy medium body with a very small complement of slightly prickly carb. Mild, understated mid-palate of chocolate and roast, with a fairly neutral finish.
"
1," Thanks to whoever brought this to the Toronto Christmas Party 04.  Smells like Jack Daniels.  Very alcoholic/astringent nose.  Strongly bitter but with some milky coffee.  The flavors imparted by the barrel is overwhelming.
"
1," Wax Sealed Bottle extra in a trade.  Appearance of cola mahogany in a glass with 1 finger off white head.  Sweet caramel, dark fruit plum and cherry.  Nice alcohol warming with a spice or two.  Lots of alcohol fruit in the finish and banana esters.  Great brew!
"
1," This beer has the characteristic wheaty aftertaste of Chimay, which I typically do not like.  However, in this one, that is countered by a strong sweetness and heavyness, not of alcohol, but flavor.  Indeed, so sweet I had a hard time finishing the bottle.  However, very interesting and very good.
"
1," On tap at the brewery in Nashville. Golden light amber color. Light pils malt aroma with minor corn. Very light and fairly refreshing. Gentle nutty taste. Body is a bit thin. Half decent light lager.
"
1," Fruity and mildly spicy aroma. Cloudy syrupy red color. Fluffy head. Head dissipates fast to a thin compressed line. Taste is spicy malt with a very nice mouthfeel. Some sweetness. Very doughy and bread pudding-like with a muted spiciness. The sipping Chimay! At a paltry 7% you can have about one more than you can of the others.
"
1," Roasty, nutty, and chocolatey with floral hop flavours in the finish.
"
1," Slightly hazy brown with a full tan head.  Aroma is malty, but strange.  It has a husky and somewhat nutty aroma that is very briefly remenisient of peanut butter.  Flavor is first sweet then has a sharp malt tang that isnt necessiarly welcomed.  Tangyness settles on the pallate and takes over.  It lends a bit of a decent grist malt character.  A bit of a redeaming malt sweetness as it warms.
"
1," Pours dark brown, cloudy with effervescent carbonating that produces a short lived light tan head of medium bubbles. No lace pattern is produced on the glass. While the head is present there is an intense aroma of yeast, roasted malts and a hint of earthy chocolate. A slight bread like aroma survives after the head is gone. The flavor is an light earthy sweetness, hints of malt and dark fruit with slight tongue tingle finishing with a hint of hop bitterness. Almost no aroma essence in the throat or nose.  Very drinkable, pleasant, shy flavor profile.
"
1," Bottle, 5.2%. Unpleasant aroma, old dust and sewer. Clear dark golden colour, small white head. The flavour is a little  sweet with some strange spiciness and harsh alcohol. Not exactly bad, but slightly unpleasant.
"
1," Bottle pours a deep dark hazy brown with an off white head and lace.  When looking into the glass, I notice lots of bubbles racing to the surface in the dark beer.  The aroma is quite sweet and sherry like.  The flavor is malty sweet with some dried fruit and a fairly dry finish.  Alcohol is well hidden.  The palate is too carbonated.  Overall, this one is OK I guess.  It really improves as it approaches room temperature.
"
1," Good flavor but expensive. Nice foamy     head, slight hops- good full body
"
1," FEB 22, 2003 Slight reddish tinted amber with a big bubbley & creamy head...aroma was spicy, like the white...lots of carbination...lots of pound-you-in-the-ass spicy yeastiness..creamy carmel..went well with slices of Chimay lait grand cru cheese...Too yeasty though IMO...but now that i know thats its the yeast i taste..I have a greater appreciation for it for some wierd reason..?? I like the Chimay White the best
"
1," Now this was very fun drinking...I enjoyed holding my chimay glass; looking at it, taking a big sniff, then enjoying the smooth flavors.  One of my definite go to Belgian Strong Ales when I want to lift my spirits & relieve stress.  Thankyou Chimay!
"
1," Bought as a bottle quite awhile ago. Lives up to its name quite well, lots of nutty flavour in this one, some malts, but really too nutty a flavour for my tastes. Comes across as a little artificial, and low alcohol content doesnt help me to get tipsy to enjoy it more either. Still okay, just not great.
"
1," This beer pours a dark brown that is very dense. The head sticks around forever and consists of large bubbles. It smells very yeasty with a little bit of fruit. I was actually underwhelmed by the aroma. This beer has good flavor. It tastes a lot like the rouge, but with more flavor a little less sweet. It is also lighter in the mouth than the rouge and is less carbinated. A pretty good beer, but I dont think I would put it in the 99th percentile as it is now.
"
1," aroma was mild and malty. Pours a nice dark red with a little with head. Nice medium body with good carbonation. Flavor was Chocalate, Sweet and light roast tones. Nice beer.
"
1," Much hoppier profile than either their IPA or Pale Ale.  Vivid red color, clinging white head.  Whiff of grapefruit and body odor (in a good way).  Its good to let this sit to let the carbonation out a bit, as it is tingling too much at first.  Significant malt balance, not exactly as caramel; stickiness with a grassy finish from the hops.  (on tap, Rock Bottom Atlanta)
"
1," Pours a murky brownish red color with a medium sized cream colored head.  Aroma is fruit laced with hints of apricots,bananas, cream and malts.  Taste is a rather bland combination of the fruits described above with a creamy aftertaste.  The weakest of the 3 Chimay Trappistes.  Not bad but not as good as one would expect.
"
1," Dark amber/cider color; Medium slightly creamy body; Aroma of yeast, caramel malt, & dark fruit; Flavor of sweet malt, yeast, caramel, dark fruit, and spice; Nicely balanced; Overall, very good.
"
1," Bottle. This one was approx 3 years old. A muddy deep brown pour with a decent head on top. Aroma of dark fruit. Tastes malty, fruity, spice, caramel. This was quite port like. This was a pretty good bottle but Chimay Blue used to be so much better in the 90s. Still pretty decent.
"
1," From a smaller bottle. Very good. Very enjoyable for style/class of beer.
"
1," Hazy golden yellow, frothy head, good lacing.  Taste is dominated by citrus and straw, with a bittering finish from citrus acid and mild hops.  Drinkable.
"
1," Bottle.  Pours brown to black with a beige pebbly head that disapates over 5 minutes. Cloudy with particles. Hints of coffee and caramel.  Solid beer, not my favorite Belgian though.
"
1," nice opague brown.  not so nice head.  real thick though.  smells like a BSA.  quite a bit of alcohol.  lots of alcohol in taste.  cant identify the flavors, but very typical of style and very balanced.  thick(ish)
"
1," Draft at Rock Bottom Atlanta.  Pours a rusty red color.  One finger, light tan head.  Piney aroma.  Very faint hop flavor, really muted.  Bready malt dominates the body.  Clean finish with just a hint of bitterness.
"
1," Deep chestnut brown body, thin light tan head.  Dry chocolate, mocha, and marshmallow aroma, quite toasty.  Sharp chocolate flavor, mocha, and toast with some roasted acidity.  Relatively thin-bodied with a decent flavor profile.  Bitter roasted malt finish.  Wood and even a hint of vanilla peek through the roasted malts; I understand why barrel-aging this beer was so successful.
"
1," JAN 7, 2009 Lives up to its colored name with a copperish hue. Softer in flavor than the Bleue it has no less complexity.
"
1," Bottle. I used to drink this once in a while a few years back. However in the meantime I have tried thousands of beers and as such I was prepared to be disappointed. It was pretty good thought. Huge, fluffy head on a chestnut brown hazy body. Aroma is hoppy with notes of alcohol. Quite bitter and dry in the mouth with clear notes of hops and caramel. Slightly unpleasant metallic finish. Pretty good.
"
1," A dark amber with a white head. Aroma contains some citrus and caramel. Flavor is a nice balance of malty and hoppy with some caramel and toffee mixed in with some oranges and grapefruit. This is still hop head friendly but offers more than just bitter. Good beer.
"
1," The best beer there is. If I could only have one beer for the rest of my life, this would be it.
"
1," Has a very fruity aroma.  A VERY dark cloudy brown color.  Thick head which dissipates fairly quickly leaving little to no lacing.  Medium sweetness in flavor with hints of fruitiness.  medium body, creamy, with average carbonation.
"
1," Pours black with maple shallows and a tawny head. The aroma is of bourbon and roasted oats that combine into an almost coconut/vanilla ensamble. The flavor is rich with strong roasted tones and hints of bourbon in smooth proportions. The body is a bit weak and crys out for just a touch more kick, although well within the limits of a sweet stout. This is clearly one of the most uniquely flavored stouts around and is a pleasure to drink.
"
1," The head was large, off-white and it had fine sized bubbles.The body was clear and the hue was orange.This beer left only a fair amount of lacing on the sides of my glass.The nose was that of bananas and the flavor was that of oranges and bananas.The mouthfeel was smooth, thin and watery.
"
1," Bottle. Hazy amber, low white head. Honeyish (wild heather) and minerally aroma. Solid mouthfeel, bready and strawlike malt, spicy, yeasty minerally notes, herbal and earthy hop balance - they are english allright. Very nice, just what I needed right now. Thanks for bringing it over to the Island Josh!
"
1," 12  ounce bottle dark brown pour off white head taste sweet caramel, nuts, roasty, toffee.Probaly one of the best browns out there
"
1," Pours a dark brown, i can see only a little bit of light through this one.  Finger and a half, almost two fingers of big foamy white head, decent lacing.  Fruity nose, some bananas and raisins, with bread dough as well.  Taste is sweet, but lacks any real fruityness, or flavor for that matter.  It isnt bad, but im not getting anything really.  Light to medium body, with a smooth feel.  Aftertaste is nonexisting, and there really isnt any presents of alcohol.  Its not bad, but the flavor is lacking.
"
1," (Draught at Pivovarsky Klub, Prague, 27 July 2011) Golden colour with frothy, white head. Malty, fruity nose with notes of bread, tropical fruit and hints of grass. Malty, fruity taste with tropical fruit, bread and a mild, grassy bitterness in the finish. Medium body, with a touch of malt sweetness. Refreshing and quite nice.
"
1," Bottle,  Large white head.  Hazy brown body.  Light plum/prune/cherry flavor.  Medium body with average carbonation.  Lightly acidic.  Muted but pretty good.  Rockfort 8 is a little better.
"
1," Not nearly as spicy as the Bleu, but somewhat spicy nonetheless!!!!1112 Deep reddish brown color, and quite carbonated.  Has that Belgian, yeasty, malty taste just not as strong.  But still very drinkable.  Perhaps it is well suited as a breakfast beer.
"
1," AUG 30, 2011 Okay, I dont need this much foam. Also, an actual aroma would be good, other than alcohol. Bland, oh wait. This is a Belgian White. Why do they call it a blonde? Grrr... well, I guess its not all that bad.  The head sucks.  Bought a six pack, so I get to re-experience this gem. Bottle cap came off with a loud pop like champagne. This isnt good as a Belgian white or a blonde ale. I think its fitting that they are calling this a blonde. This is not a blonde ale.  Even rate beer has it as a Belgian wit. Thats what its closer too, for sure.
"
1," a very good Belgium Dubbel that reminds me how pleasurable is to drink an authentic trappist beer.
"
1," 750ml bottle shared with HogTownHarry at Brasserie Frisco. Pours a murky bubbly reddish-brown with a large lasting creamy off-white head. Nice aroma of yeast, dark fruit, brown sugar and spices. Sweet fruity flavour with yeast, spices, malt and a mild bitter finish -- very tasty. Alcohol is very well hidden. Medium bodied. Pleasant and easy to drink, this is very good stuff.
"
1," APR 16, 2009 All three Chimays that you normally find are all really great beers.  Just plain delicious.
"
1," This beer appears lovely.  Served at room temperature, I enjoyed the perfect head over the deep mysterious brown liquid.  The aroma is seductive--enormously complex.  A swallow yields warming, but wonderfully restrained, alcohol.  And so happy that the carbonation is in check.  But I cant say that there is really a lot of flavor here.  I tried this after a Schneider Weisse and found the latter to have a much richer flavor.  I was surprised.  This beer has changed, or I have.
"
1," 
"
1," a solid brew, but wouldnt want more than one (or even more than about 8 ounces).  A generally over-hyped overrated style IMO -- I just dont get much complexity or sense much drinkability from it, and a good style has to have one or the other.
"
1," Not very impressed. Very light color same as vegetable oil. Aroma was weak. Taste was defintely light due to there really wasn't much taste at all.
"
1," Bottle. Cloudy brown colour. Phenols, medicin, metal, light fruitiness, herbs, some spices, a bit watery. Not a big fan of this one.
"
1," Tap @ Coalition. Slightly hazy orange-gold pour with a short white head which leaves a moderate, geographic lace. Mild hop and malt nose. Medium-light body and moderate, fine carbonation.  Hope profile falls to the bitter side, with grapefruit and some pine. Malt is not very sweet or aromatic, being mostly rye toast and a touch of burnt caramel. I like my APAs to be lighter, more on the fruit, light toast and caramel side and very sessionable, so Im not a fan of this ale which is on the dark side and can be a bit of work. Still, its a solid ale from a promising craft brewer and many folks will appreciate it more than I do.
"
1," Brown with off white head.Faint malt nose. Light malt faintly nutty flavor with short dry finish
"
1," 750ml - Pours dark brown with nice tan head.  Fruity aroma and taste, mild warmth from alcohol. Not in the same league as Rochefort 8.
"
1," Pours a dark,deep red with a tan head.  Thick head with good laceing in a tulip glass.  Taste of roasted malts,citrus and yeast.  Nice smooth, full mouth. Well worth the every penny. One of my favorite trappist ales.
"
1," subtle not-so-frothy head from the larger bottle.  Its the first brew Ive uncorked which gives it immediate bonus points! Smells delicious and tastes even more fabulous of a fruity bouquet.  Delicious!
"
1," 500ml bottle, Rehills, Ncl. Not convinced that this bottle has been capped correctly or theres been a problem in the brewing/bottling process.. Sourness in the aroma, transfers to the taste, leaving little room for anything else. A bit metallic, certainly not like any porter Ive had before and probably needs re-rating (I hope...)
"
1," Quite a long name. Poured deep and dark black, brown head. Whiskey aroma along with some sweeter malts and a bit of roast. Dominant bourbon flavor, roast is an afterthought. Medium bodied. It wasnt that bad but I think the barrel aging would have fared better with a bigger beer.
"
1," JUL 2, 2011 25/06/2011 75cl bottle blind tasted @ Gentse Biervereniging"
1," Dark brown colour, small head, diminishing. Aromas of sweet nuts, roasted, much carbon dioxid. Tastes with caramel, bitter hops,long finish, sweetly. Hints of cacao, and dark chocolate. A good beer.
"
1," Get alot of dark fruits and a little sourness in the aroma.Pours a murky brown with a huge tan head.Flavors of dark fruits and alcohol.Medium mouthfeel with some noticable alcohol in the finish.
"
1," JUL 5, 2008 While I must say spending $5.00 for a single bottle of beer is not something I do with regularity, I did so because of the fact this beer was Top 5 on many lists and its the only one on the list I had access to. So I headed up to BevMo with my best friend (who got a ticket on the way there HAH!), plunked down my money, took it home let it stay nice and cool in the garage overnight and opened it the next day. A HUGE head, Im talking seriously HUGE. A wonderful aroma of raisins, dates, plums and a spiciness. The taste had a nice roastiness flavor, with nutmeg and a peppery flavor. It had some teeth on it with a 9% ABV, so you could taste that also, which put me off a bit (reminded me of this really crappy French beer I once had). While this was an excellent dark ale, I would not say it belongs in the Top 5 on these lists. Too expensive for what little you get and didnt blow me away like I was hoping.
"
1," Bottle 33cl.	Pours a clear red colour with a normal size head.	Aroma is rich in fruit, mals, hops and east, very well balanced.	Taste is also greatly balanced, some flavour as smells.	Good Dubbel.
"
1," Pours deep burgundy brown with off white head.  The aroma is slightly meaty, funky and of dark fruit.  My smelling experience was somewhat ruined by another taster saying it reminded him of the smell of dead mice he feeds his pet snake.  The flavor is sweet, complex with notes of various spices I cant yet name.  The palate is velvety, warming, and bubbly.  Overall this is a very nice beer, but the spice/funk thing is not quite my thing.  It may need more time.
"
1," Golden, slowly diminishing white head, bisquity and herbal hoppy nose with a light touch of cardboard; moderate sweet-bitter flavour, medium bodied; some herbal-hoppy traces in the bisquity-grainy finish. Not bad, but not really convincing................
"
1," OCT 19, 2008 Update 10/2008.  Had again and seemed really creamy compared to before.  More mocha also.  Almost more like a sweet stout.	Poured black.  Pretty thin brown head.  Roasty aroma, not real powerful.  Inoffensive going down, mostly coffee and licorice.  Not bad for a place trying to be fairly main stream.  Had this at the Rock Bottom Brewery in Charlotte NC.
"
1," Bought the larger bottle in Copenhagen. A large head, unfortunately less flavorful than I would have hoped. Dark brown color that goes down smooth with little bitterness. Leaves a taste on the tongue wanting more. Hints of a caramel roastiness yet also the hops seem to be clearly found. I love Trappist beer, and perhaps I hyped this one up too much, as it is not the favorite I expected it to be. Still a very good beer though, and the 9% ABV was surprisingly and happily not really noticeable.
"
1," Swing top bottle. Dark brown color. Malt, caramel and cellar notes in the aroma. Malty sweet flavor with caramel and cellar notes. Plums. Somewhat sticky mouthfeel. Full bodied, alcoholic.
"
1," Well, its the finest of the three Chimayss Ive done had.  The fizziness is business but the bubble is subtle.  Pours scrumptiously into a Chimay tulip glass and down my throat, but not often, because Im broke as hell.
"
1," JAN 18, 2009 obviously a good beer but does seem to have declined in quality. i expected it to be pretty good in belgium but the 2002 was surpringly bland. buttery for a trappist and with pleasant yeast bite but not a hell of a lot else
"
1," Pours a coffee black with a dark medium tan head that diminishes to the side of my glass rather quickly. This brew lives up to its name since the bourbon comes out in the aroma and flavor. Sweet aroma also has hints of oatmeal, dark chocolate, and dried fruit. Bourbon flavor finishes with a mild dry bitterness. Just like drinking bourbon straight, this is a good sipping pastime. This is one of the better bourbon stouts that I have had. Well Done!
"
1," Bottle.  Moderate barnyard, barley malt, and grassy hops aroma.  Golden yellow color with small head.  Light barnyard, barley malt and moderate grass hops flavor.  Very nice and different - really like the kellerbier characteristics.
"
1," Bottled. Hazy pale nutbrown colour, mediumsized off-white head. Aroma is wheat, banana, some fruits and mild notes of caramel. Flavour is wheat, citrusfruits, some yeast and mild peppery notes as well.
"
1," 11 ox bottle- poured very dark red, head quickly disappeared.  Fruity, malt aroma.  Hits the mouth with a solid body, finish a little acidic with hops and carbonation.  A good beer, but a little over priced.
"
1," 6/22/02- Ryans Sports Bar, Wards Center Honolulu HI. A dark iced tea color, malty nose. Quite lively carbonation. Mouthfeel was just right! This place had great service and delicious food. The staff was very friendly, like meeting long lost buddies! I had the oysters and focaccio. Highly recomended!
"
1," Very bold at the start. Then (this bottle anyways) leaves rather glassy. I will not hold the beer responsible though; this beer had dust and was sitting in the back corner of the shelf where I bought it. Great appearance and smell. I just wish I could taste this when it is a bit younger.
"
1," JUN 29, 2003 This beer is characterized by a nice head with small bubbles and some medium sized ones. The head is long lasting and has a nice tan color. The aroma is non-offensive and mild. Its color is a dark non-transparent brown with some particles suspended. The flavor is mellow and very much top my liking. it is not overly strong though and does not have that immediate feeling that other strong beers can give. All in all one of the better beers I have rated. GF gave is an alright rating. I later re-rated this brew. I had an extremely upset stomach after trying this beer. I had noted previously that there were others who experienced this problem. Hence, my rating was lowered.		Re-Rate"
1," Pours dark and hazy with a large, stable head. Aroma is malt and spices, caramel and a hint of spruce. Texture is a bit thin for such a heavy beer.  Taste is faintly bubblegum, malty and spicy, with a warm and slightly bitter palate.
"
1," NOV 18, 2006 Pours a dark murky amber with a large rocky off-white head. Aroma of raisons, strong warming alcohol, spices, caramel, ever so slightly metallic hops. The mouthful is smooth, and is the big strength of the beer, it shows warmth but complexity. Flavours of dried fruit, sweet caramel, apricot, nuts, amongst others. The finish is fruity, sweet and warming. Very nice!
"
1," Very bready mash like, raw grain, but clean and not overly sweet. Sill drinkable enough.
"
1," Bottle. 11.2 FL. OZ.  My first Chimay. Thick, dark brown with quickly diminishing head.  Malty, yeasty, sweet aroma.  Great palate, incredibly smooth.  Flavor is sweet at first, then dryness quickly takes over and leaves you craving the next sip.

1," Thin white head, pale golden body.  Aroma is pale malt sweetness and little else.  Taste is grassy, caramel, strange.
"
1," 11.2 oz Bottle - pours very dark brown with a medium brownish-white head that lingers till the end.  First impression is that I like Chimay Red better, however as a continue my drink, I think I like this equally well.  I do think the Red is slightly smoother, but considering the upped alcohol content in this one, its impressively smooth.  Very nice aftertaste, malty and flavorful.  The only thing that holds me back is the $5 price tag that each bottle carries in my area.  A good taster, but definitely a special occasion beer for me.
"
1," Tasted at Cellars in St. Paul, MN.  Dark brown with a smallish head.  Strong coffee element here, which is no surprise.  Not a lot else going on, as the coffee dominates, and makes this pretty one dimensional.  I could have a cold coffee, but instead Il have a black magic.  Hmm...I not a coffee drinker, so Il pass.  I like coffee flavors, if done right in my beer.  This is too overpowering with the coffee element.
"
1," Typical Brown ale.  Malty nose.  Amber pour with small off white head.  Taste is slightly nutty with a sweetness that I dont care for.

1," A very good and smooth beer for a dark beer.  Most beers of this strength (7%) have a very heavy, hoppy taste; at least to me.  This is a strong beer without being overpoweringly strong or too stout.
"
1," The last of the three to be tasted since I met them. Dissapointed. I expected more from this beer but was quite tasteless according the Trapist beers standars. The quallity is at sight.
"
1," High potency hops.  Intense orange. Long bitter finish. Mild Cascade aroma. Decent, but it's that usual one-dimensional superCascade IPA.
"
1," Another rare bottle from Acknud. Pours opaque brown/black with a 4-finger dark tan head. Primary aroma is coffee! Secondary aroma is chocolate. Full bodied with creamy/frothy carbonation. Flavor is coffee, coffee, darkly toasted malt, coffee, and I cant taste anything else. It moderates, but finishes quite coffee. This is a good kick in the head stout. Arguably underrated.
"
1," Thick, dark brown body with a fluffy, cocoa-colored head.  A nice, sweet and roasted nose on the one.  Burnt toast, chocolate syrup, vanilla, espresso beans, bourbon, a little wood and oily oats.  The body is creamy and smooth with nice suppleness.  Flavors are good, but not as great as I might have thought.  The roasted character comes out more than the barrel-aging or the sweet chocolate and caramel.  With a little more balance between the sweet and roasted elements would have been appreciated.  Smoke comes in toward the finish to keep things interesting.  The barrel-aging is done well here, as it is not overbearing or completely understated.  With a bit better balance between the sweet and roasted and this would been even better.  Great to see from an Indiana brewery not named ""FFF"".
"
1," Little dry dark brown, almost black, beer. Direct taste is not the best but after-taste is very good.	Good beer from time to time.
"
1," An orange beer with a very white head. The aroma is sweet with light notes of caramel, and the flavor is sweet malty and again with notes of caramel.
"
1," DEC 1, 2007 bottle. This stuff is a dark, cloudy mahogany with varying shades and a firm, bubbly white head. Theres a nice sweet vinous nose with cloves and a dab of alcohol. The dry flavor is assertive of  raisins, smoked leaves, cloves, and a sharp bitterness which is immediately balanced by a honey sweetness. This is rich and complex in an impeccable harmony.			[Nov 30, 2007]-------  The nose reveals a rewarding complexity after the Chimay white fiasco. Adequate spiced notes and fruity aromas come out. The flavor is a bit sugary, but estery, complex, fruity hints are known. This is a good beer"
1," bottle - Italia Beer Festival (Milan) - Unfortunately this beer already has a huge obstacle to overcome in that all weizenbocks are inevitably compared to Aventinus. While nowhere close, this beer did have some redeeming qualities as far as taste and aroma goes. there are far worse brews out there in this category.
"
1," MAR 15, 2007 I must have had a bad bottle the first time i sampled this brew.		Bottle resampled a the Belgian beer tasting at State Line. Pours dark with a large beige head. Aroma of yeast and alcohol (just ok). Flavor is smooth, sweet, citrus, fruit, and chocolate. Good body, good brew.
"
1," Another fine Belgian ale slightly red in colour with a light fruity yeast aroma and a little more hop character than many Belgian ales.
"
1," Pours copper with an off-white head. Aroma is roasted malt and fruity notes. Flavour is roasted caramel, alcohol and fruity notes.
"
1," Wow.  This is an excellent beer.  Light brown head, dark copper appearance and a taste that creeps up and explodes.  As another person said, this fine Belgian brew gets better as it slightly warms up in the glass.  A veritable taste sensation.  Time to try the white and blue now.  Yum.
"
1," Although I do think that this beer is a good beer, I dont see how this is in the 99 percentile. I didnt think that it had the flavor or stood out enough in my mind to be this high up in the ratings.	I do like the color and flavor but it just lacks the oomph of what I would consider a 99 percentile beer.
"
1," This beer is ponderous.  It has more alcohol than the rouge, but not much more flavor.  Its a little sweeter and far more alcoholic.  I disagree with the high rating on this one--just because its stronger doesnt mean its better.  Chimay Bleu is not nearly as complex as the top Belgian strong ales, and it really doesnt have a distinctive, sophisticated flavor like the Rouge and Blanche.  In fairness, this is a good beer, and its great to know that it is widely available and pretty affordable.
"
1," 750mL bottle.  Pours a clear reddish brown with a thick and reasonably persistent head.  Aromas of yeast and malt.  Mild fruity flavour, strong malt, medium sweetness, slight sourness.  Medium bodied, lively carbonation, smooth with a slight bitter finish.
"
1," Bouteille de 750 ml. Armes de levure belge et de fruits mrs. Robe rouge bourgogne, plusieurs particules en suspension. Belle mousse, mais qui disparat rapidement. Trs veloute en bouche, la levure accompagne une touche de caramel et de chocolat. Puis les fruits mrs mnent  une finale lgrement amre o pointe galement lalcool.
"
1,"pale malt, grain but also chaff. Taste not bad for Pilsener, but there is some fine hoppiness. no distinctive palate, but the bitterness from the hops slowly fade away. Average to reasonable Pilsener.
"
1," I think this was the most over carbonated cider I have ever had out of a bottle (next to french cidres of course). This didnt leave much of a positive impression on me and in fact Im a little disappointed I drove >50 miles to find and ended up having to by an entire case of it just to try it. Damn Pennsylvania liquor laws! Luckily the case was under $20. That should have told me something then and there.
"
1," Bottle.  Pours dark brown, moderate white head.  Nose is bananas, yeast, maybe some malts, and an overall sourness.  Flavor is much of the same, with a carbonated mouthfeel.
"
1," Hazy blonde colour.  Aroma of lemon, coriander, light maltiness.  Sweet and soft with a flowery, honeyish nature and nutmeggy accent.
"
1," Floral aroma, light yellow, lacey, fresh, crisp, medium bitterness serviceable pils. Saaz hops, a bit grainey, a bit of bitterness
"
1," Had for the first time at Smokeless Joes. very nice!!! bottle small brown  lotsa malts and sweetness on the nose with a fruit caremel malt flavour, enjoyed this one
"
1," Dark brown colour with a medium-thick head.  The aroma is malt-accented but has a lot of chocolate.  On the palate, a strange combo of thin and creamy, probably from trying to shoehorn a nourishing beer into 5%abv format.  The flavours arent bad - chocolate, light roast and faint mint - and it finishes roasty.  Decent.
"
1," Draught at the Hamilton Place location. Pours deep clear amber with khaki head. The aroma is light caramel and toast with some distant cinnamon and perhaps nutmeg, maybe some vanilla, and some faint raisin. The flavor is toasted and Munich malt, and sort of a dusty caramel sweetness. It finishes with wood, herbal notes, and a slight drying spiciness. Yeasty aftertaste.
"
1," Bottle courtesy of hippie4beer.  Aroma is overpowering w/ coffe, however the coffee flavor is much more subdued.  I not a big fan of the coffee stouts, but this one is nicely done.
"
1," One of the best beers in the world.
"
1," Belgian strong ales are not my favorite style and this beer was no exception. Pours a murky brownish red with a large head. Aroma is sickly sweet. Flavor is heavy on the sweetish raisinish cloying and fruity side. Not a beer I would buy again.
"
1," Good stuff but I think I preferred the White I had. Maybe the White seemed hoppier?
"
1," Pours a dark chestnut in color with a nice creamy mocha head. Aroma is fruity and yeasty. As I drink it, the carbonation is what strikes me the most. It is so light and fizzy the beer seems to disapear in my mouth before I get to swallow it.  Flavor is not overly sweet but leans that way with a strong malt note. Finish is clean and light. Amazingly little alcohol flavor. Now I am sorry I got the little bottle. This is an interesting beer and maybe I need to try more of these Belgians to get some perspective.
"
1," Bottle from Bier-Spezialitten-Laden, Berlin. Slightly hazy amber with moderate carbonation and next to no head. Sweetosh, orange fruit and grassy hop aroma. Malty flavour, with caramel, summer fruits and a dryish finish. Drinkable.
"
1," With alcohol content rated around 12 % it's hard to expect any great head in barley wine. At first a bit harsh on me but gets better with time. Highly malty. I try in few years again...
"
1," Bottle looks good, but a bit too dark, so some things are not easy to read. Beer in the glass very zippy, nice head. Starts quite strong, wonderful spicy, wheaty-grasy notes on a nice malty background. Well balanced, spicy finish. Good export!
"
1," My first brew in Scotland. Thanks to Stuart. Pours a dark brown color with a think white head. The aroma is fruity, some toffee and yeast. The flavor is a very rich and warm fruity flavor with caramel and toffee. Quite thin. Light hops. Enjoyable.
"
1," Golden and cloudy, stable mid-sized head , sourish diacetyl and caramelly grains in the nose; light sweetish-sourish flavour, light bodied, at least soft, slightly lingering fruity-sourish finish. Yuk......
"
1," FEB 13, 2004 Very nice dark amber colour, lively bubbles, little head. Yeasty aroma, very enticing. Strong Belgian taste, nice kick to it. Really quite complex. Tiny bubbles feels great trickling down your throat. An absolute pleasure. Think I'll buy some more tommorrow... 33cl Bottle. ReRate Febuary 10, 2004"
1," Everyone has heard of Chimay and for good reason, it is a great beer.  Nice interplay between different elements while staying balanced.  Great flavors.
"
1," One of the better Belgian beers, a double, sweet, caramel dark Trappist with a caramel taste which grows in richness in your mouth.
"
1," Hazy reddish dark brown colour with lots of particles floating in the bottle. Thick creamy off-white head. Strong - not pungent - sourly, vinous aroma with a whiff of roasted caramel. I could taste notes of berries, almonds and the yeast, accompanied by a great creamy mouthfeel. That sourness didnt contribute distinctly to the flavour, but is clearly adding its complexity in the aroma. Late, pleasant alcohol warmth. I think I might have enjoyed the Dubbel by Westmalle a tiiiny bit more, though, this is a bit too much on the yeasty side...
"
1," Royale kraag die snel verdwijnt. Bitterzoete vlakke smaak, weinig body. Ik ben nooit een fan van chimay geweest maar ik dacht geef het nog een kans. Helaas, not my cup of tea euhhhh bier.
"
1," (Bottle).  Very fruity aroma.  Dark brown color with substantial head.  Fruity flavor, hints of malt, and the alcohol intrudes a bit.  Sweet finish, but somewhat disappointing in its length.  Quality beer, but I prefer the Chimay Red.
"
1," JUL 21, 2005 Dated 2004-From the bottle"
1," Bottle.  Dark hazed brown with a thick off-white head.  Brown sugar, spice, dark fruit on aroma.  Sweet brown sugar and toast body with yeasty spice, date, a hint of ripe banana and leather.  Very nice example of a style I usually dont have a strong love for.  Cant believe how long Ive been seeing these Chimay bottles on shelves without trying them.
"
1," Beautiful amber color with fine head. Very funny yeasty and spicy arom and flavor.
"
1," i love the chimay monks. they rock the house. this is a slight step below the blue..but never the less..a great f""in beer. nothing bad about it at all.
"
1," Nice deep rich burnt carmal color with minimal head.  I really enjoy the look of this beer.  Strong yeast, carmel smell. Moist, rich brown bread/carmel like taste.  Medium to full bodied with good carbonation.  Very enjoyable.
"
1," AUG 20, 2008 Smallish, offwhite head; block, not entirely opaque body. Thick, sweetish aroma with complex chocolate, licorice, and spice notes. Deep, sweet, spicy taste with lingering sweetjess with licorice notes. Complex and interesting. A world classic. (Should probably rerate this.)
"
1," AUG 22, 2010 Courtesy of northernbrews	Bottle"
1," 33cl bottle poured into a goblet.  The beer smells fantastic....with notes of fruit....plums maybe.  The beer pours a nice reddish brown, like a true dubbel should, and leave a nice off white head with large champagne size bubbles.  Taste is fruit up front, noting tastes of fruit again, sweet, but with a dry finish.  The hops provide just the right amount of hops to keep this from being too sweet.  Very well balanced, with some linger bitterness.  Palate is medium body with lively carbonation.  Overall, a great classic dubbel.  This really hits in all the right places.  Very, very good.
"
1," #26 gul yespr	clear yellow ,smooth white head. 	faint aroma, yeasty, faint chemicals 	flavor is ripe fruity, spicy, strange notes
"
1," NOV 3, 2006 Pours a dark brown with a slightly orange glow. I assume this is bottle-conditioned, but I could not find any sediment. Perhaps I did not let it sit long enough before opening? Aroma is not too present - slightly sour, some sweetness and slightly medicinal. A very off-white head which settles to a beautiful soft foam. Wonderful crystal & light malt taste and completely transparent hopping. Slight alcohol taste but instantly smoothed over by sweet & sour aftertaste. Sourish tinge, but hardly overwhelming - nowhere near, say, a Grand Cru. WONDERFUL mouthfeel! Carbonation full and present at first, but disappears in the mouth leaving a liquid perfectly balanced in thickness. I prefer this to the Bluecap, at the moment. Fantastic beer!
"
1," Bottle, 4.9%. Clear shiny yellow colour. Very small white head. Very clean flavour. Good maltiness, dusty and nice. Nice subtle hoppiness, wrzig. Good, clean and sffig.
"
1," Excellent beer. Aroma is malty, although not that strong. Pours dark brown. Really smooth, you dont notice that its nine per cent. Flavour is sweet and malty, also a touch fruity I thought there was even a hint of banana...maybe thats just me being stupid? Anyway this is an absolutely excellent beer, highly reccomended.
"
1," Bottle at virgils in NYC.  Large clove, yeast, and Belgian spice.  Sweet malts and dry candied plums.
"
1," Totally not fair for me to judge this one, but I going to anyway for my own reference. Ugh. Gross. I so not a fan. Apparently this one kicks ass within Belgiran Strong Ales so I should probably get an education there. For now, thumbs way down.
"
1," There wasnt a whole lot going on here.  I saw this beer pop up everywhere so I tried it and rated it.  There is nothing terrible but it wasnt what I was expecting.  Maybe there was too much hype and my expectations were too high.
"
1," Sappy pine resin with caramel sweetness.  Barely hazy, light orange, gold.  Pungent pine, citrus hops start, slight esters intrude, giving way to a sweet finish.  Bitterness is noticeable in the aftertaste.  Light-medium body, medium carbonation.  A good IPA.  Appears to be an english yeast that highlights malt as well as the hops.
"
1," JUL 24, 2009 One of the first Belgians Ive ever had, and sparked an interest with big beers. A great beer that hides its alcohol content pretty well, it also has a great flavor and aroma.
"
1," yeasty and fruity aroma, very dark red in colour, massive head, malty, fruity and syrupy, alcohol notes, pleasant aftertaste.
"
1," Had a couple sample pours at a beer tasting event in a local grocery store. Served in a champagne flute with Chimay Blue and Chimay cheese. Orange/Light amber in color, nice head and a bit cloudy.	Fruity and floral aroma. Bready, biscuity with some dark fruits like plums and raisins.  Well carbonated with that Belgian yeast characteristics in the finish. Very refreshing and smooth. Had a lot of the same flavors and characteristics of the blue, but much more mellower and softer. Could certainly drink a couple of these and they went well with the buttery cheese of Chimay.
"
1," 12oz bottle poured in a specialy glass.  BIFBW (FT) pours clear and yellow like a macro-brew.  The head is very thin and short-lasting.  The nose consists of bubble gum and pears.  This beer seems to be highly carbonated and short on flavor.  The body is medium to thin.  The finish has a touch of lemon and a touch of rice adjunct taste.
"
1," Had a bottle of Chimay Blue yesterday. Poured into original Chimay goblet it formed a decent off white head on top of a clear brown beer. My friend poured the yeast depot into his glass as well, made it a bit cloudy and it bit more bitter. Aroma is full with fruits. Plums, abricots, some apple, blackberries and blueberries. All with a nice hint of kandy sugar to add some sweetness. Flavour is full of differents sweets and bitters. You can definitely define the fruits, as well as the use of the kandy sugar. A really subtle, round and well balanced body made this a one of a kind brew. Enjoyed in the sun yesterday and it was great.
"
1," Described as an IPA on the bottle. I dont think so. Aroma heavily alcohol, whiskey. Malt dominant in flavour, although resinous hops present. Metallic, thin mouthfeel for its strength. I think theyre trying for an Orkney Skullsplitter kind of vibe, but call it a Scottish Strong Ale guys (or put more hops in).
"
1," Orange body with a chunky floating head.  Aroma is fruity and very spicy.  A very unique nose.  Flavour was very hoppy and the finish was long, sweet and a little harsh for my liking.
"
1," [500ml bottle, Hebridean Brewery] Very dark brown pour with a thin white bubbly head. Slight aromas of roasted chocolate malt. Quite mild flavour all round, some toasty bitterness is evident but theres not really much to it. Faint coffee finish. Would make a pretty good mild [15042009]
"
1," Cask (gravity dispense) at Egham Beer Festival on 21 April 2011. Seemed more amber in colour than gold.  A little sulphur in the aroma. Quite sharp, citric hop presence. Some appley fruit. Firm and quite bitter. Nothing particularly extraordinary here but comes together as a solid, very drinkable and pleasantly refreshing brew. Does what it does (and no doubt what was intended) rather well.
"
1," Bottle, 5.5%. Clear yellow colour. Weak spicy aroma. The flavour is quite malty, slightly vinous. Not perfectly clean, but nice enough. Dusty finish.
"
1," Pours to a hazy reddish brown, with off-white head that lingers thru most of the glass and reduces to decent lacing. Had a nice, pleasant aroma of dark fruit and malty sweetness. Taste was marked by just enough carbonation to add some zing, to the malty sweet dary fruit. About 3/4 thru, the 7% alcohol began kicking in, and this all led to a long, warming finish. I really enjoyed this beer.
"
1," A wonderful ale. It seems to lack a little of the warmth of the red Chimay, but it nearly makes up for it with a stronger, darker flavor.
"
1," On tap at the broad ripple location. Pours mostly black with thin tan head. Nose is rich dark coffee and roasted malt. Flavor is dark, bitter, black coffee that doesnt seem to balance very well with the malts used. The coffee flavor itself is pretty good, but overall this one  doesnt quite do it for me.
"
1," (Bottle) Pours a rich dark brown color with an off-white head. Flavor of sweet caramel, Belgian yeast, and  dark fruits. Very smooth, especially for the alcohol content. A great beer, and much better than the other Chimays in my opinion.
"
1," JUL 30, 2007 Mmm, now I remember why I have Chimay glasses.	Smells of malt, figs, plums, chocolate, yeast, fruity.	Flavour is perfectly sour and perfectly bitter, moderate sweetness and almost burnt to the touch.
"
1," bottle from Bierzwerg. Clear golden colour, large white head. Hoppy nose. Slightly malty with herbal-grassy hops.
"
1," A little too hoppy but a nice beer. Smooth at first with a nice long bitter finish. ok
"
1," Phenominal from start to finish. Nice body, not too heavy with a light alcohol nose. Port like flavors develop as the beer warms. A great nite cap.
"
1," Yeasty and Odd.  Green and unfinished.  Strangly sweet and not in a good way.  The Chimay Premere is much better.
"
1," on tap-pours a white ring for a head and slightly hazy yellow color.  Aroma is clove/spice, lemon, wheat.  Taste is clove/spice, lemon, wheat.  Some banana as it warms.  OK/mild effervescence.
"
1," DEC 28, 2011 Im guessing this was the holiday porter, since there werent any descriptions and the waitress said it was their seasonal ""dark"".  Whatever.  Not bad, watery, decent roasted malt but too sweet with a very mild, forgettable finish.  Better than my sandwich.
"
1," OCT 4, 2007 Why spend 12 dollars on a 750 ml. bottle of beer?		Because its Chimay Blue Cap.  Really one of the true classics Blue Cap really does a good job of promoting the high quality reputation the monks have made for themselves when it comes to making beer.
"
1," Sampled at the Florida Brewers Guild Beerfest, March 11.  One of the best at the festival.  Good amber notes with honey, sweet malts, and a good balance of hops.
"
1," FEB 5, 2007 (Bottle) Pours beaytiful deep red. Aroma of fruits, flowers, spices and herbs with pears, apples, plums, brown sugar, toffee, butter, nougat, candy and some raisins. Small hints of orange, roasted malt, bubble gum, yeast, glue, nuts, liqueur, alcohol, pineapple sweetness and some wet stone. Medium sweet, extremely complex aroma. Light rosted toffee-ish flavour with some fruts, spices, ginger, eartyness and brown sugar. Maybe some tobacco. Pretty full mouthfeel with a touch of alcohol. Some herbs and sugar in the aftertaste. Belgian beers often lacks in  freshness, this one included, but it is ohhh so complex, and some times thats enough. Pretty smooth mouthfeel with a noticeable carbonation. High five for a three point eight.
"
1," Amber body with big off-white head. Aroma is yeasty and fruity. The flavor is slightly dry and of dark fruits. Sparkling mouthfeel with a dry, bitter finish.
"
1," JUL 4, 2008 Fantastic brown color with a modest head that dissipated while drinking. Lacing lasted throughout and the sediments were visible with each tilt of the glass. Slight citrus and plum flavoring and yeasty odor with a decent amount of sugar. A nice beer. (Re-rated in Aug05 and Oct 05, with an upward bump on the latter. Steady rating and experience in 8/07, nice spice and dark fruit interplay, rich, enjoyable.) Re-rate in 7/08"
1," Clearly a beer that has a lot of fruit in the flavour. Lots of grape and other dark fruit in the nose and flavour of the beer. Of course there is lots of Belgian yeast in the flavour as well. Really a nice beer. One of the better Belgians Ive had.
"
1," Judging by the high marks from everybody else, I thinking I might have gotten a bad batch at the Nashville location.  Nice red-tinged brown with a thin white head, and a good malty, nutty aroma.  Flavor was pretty good at first, when the glass was cold, but as it warmed, a bitter, completely unappealing strong yeastiness became apparent (This was the same flavor that has plagued some of my homebrews, in particular the batches that I brewed without using a secondary fementer, so the wort spent the entire fermentation on top of the spent yeast).  The initial flavor of this brown ale was quite nice, a smooth, lightly toasted sweet nuttiness, but all of that goodness suffered because of the off-flavors in this brew.  I plan on trying again and re-rating, but for now, I very unhappy.
"
1," Pours a darkish red/brown.  Aromas of spice, coriander, yeast, and alcohol.  Flavor has an alcohol taste to it, mixed with a nice smokey dark fruit.  Also has strong hints of spice.
"
1," Its been a long time since Ive given this a try.  Poured an opaque brown with an off white fluffy head.  The aroma was lite with spice (clove?, cardamom?) and fruit (banana?).  I also detected a bit of hops.  The flavor changed, as you might guess, as the brew warmed.  This brew had the flavors of slightly sweet raison with spices such as ginger and cinnamon.  The body was nice with a bubbly fizz on the front and a creamy finish with a bit-o-hops.  Good stuff.  I bet this ages great!
"
1," A trappist beer. Dark nice taste of dark choclate.	It dossent fell like its 9%, one hellluva nice beer from Belgium.	Its easy to get but its nice
"
1," Pale golden, limited carbonation, mid-sized stable white creamy head; pale-malty, slightly sourish nose with a grassy bitter background; soft, smooth MF, light to medium bodied; grassy-malty, a bit papery finish. Why do they try to make a copy of a boring northern-german Pilsener............
"
1," lovely bitter and still malty sweet with amazingly soft mouthfeel and freshness. A bit alcoholic when drank as cold as recommended. One of my all time favourites. Its shamefull that the Finnish liqueur-monopol removed this brilliant beer from theis selection! Luckily I managed to hoard some bottles.
"
1," Again, had this umpteen times but never rated it. Small bottle. Pours a murky copper with thick head that dissipates slowly. Aroma is musty, slightly vegetal. Mouthfeel is instantly thick and chewy. Taste is hard to describe...malty to be sure with notes of leather and licorice (hint) with a very subdued hop note that I cant adequately describe. Tasty no doubt but, again, young and lacking complexity that Ive experienced from cellared bottles of this beer. Lovely, just not rocking my world tonight.
"
1," Pours brownish reddish black. Grapey, coffee-y, chocolatey aromas at first. Nice conglomerarion of flavors, very toasty and crisp - some coffee, again, some smokey flavors, some spicy notes. Fairly quaffable, too. Sampled at Noogfest 4.
"
1," Soft aroma (a bit too soft) with scents of sweet vanilla. Cloudy amber, strong thick head. I would say classy, quality feel, light in mid, stronger on aftertaste. Nicely warming. Despite lack of any superb qualities Chimay Red is well crafter brew, recommended to all
"
1," Draft in Chattanooga. Black in the glass with a creamy tan head that settles to a thin lasting layer which leaves light lace. Nice coffee and chocolate aroma. The flavor also has coffee and chocolate with a roast backing. Medium body with a roast coffee bitter aftertaste. Nice!
"
1," Brown hazy pour sporting a large beige head. Fizzy carbonation. Nose is hoppy, fruity esters of banana, raisins, grapes, and some dark caramel malts, and maybe some phenolics. Taste is similar with a full Belgian yeast character. Very smooth, easy drinker. Always one of my favorites.
"
1," Bottle from Plano Beverage in Plano, TX.	Pours a hazy red with beige head, good retention. Has nice floral, malty, earthy aroma. Flavor has some citris with nice malt character, balanced bitter. Mouth feel seems like a belgium, soft and chaimpaign llike. Over all a very tasty brew....
"
1," After pouring into a glass, I was greeted by a healthy, frothy head that immediately reminded me of that from a rootbeer float.  Beer itself is a dark, dark red-orange.  Aroma has subtle hints of caramel and coffee, in no way overpowering.  Taste has a subtle, tingling front end that fades, then quicky explodes with a biting hop aftertaste that borders on overpowering, in my opinion.  This is beer.
"
1," Had on tap at Big River Grille in downtown Chattanooga. Poured to dark brown color with a thin tan head that stuck around to mid-glass and left a little lacing. Both the nose and taste were predominantly chocolate, with just a tad of roasted nuts and coffee. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and almost chewy sweet, but enjoyable, with a finish that was long and somewhat sticky.
"
1," dry for the style, quite wheaty, not much in the way of spices. color isgolden, clear, head is white, thin, and not lasting.  pretty average.
"
1," lots of malt, clove, sweet corn, vegetable hops an some dustiness.  Looks perect in glass. Tate is just strong enough with dark fruits, currants and spices. Delicious malt blankets the taste buds wrapping a warm alcohol flavor.  After taste is good"
1," Light colored, small frothy head. Buttery, malty aroma. Complex flavor with pineapple, butter, fresh chesse and mango. Good lacing. A strong resemblance to Staffelberg Mrzen, but this beer is even more fruity and has a bit cleaner palate.
"
1,	A complex and tasty bock that either matured well since the last visitors came by or they plain have no idea what theyre talking about.		I like
1," 2001 vintage bottle. Deep ruby red, big but shortlived off white head and good condition. Fruity and oxidized in the nose with hefty sweet breadiness noticable.Soft and oxidized in the mouth, some fruity woodiness and low sweet malt notes but overall quite thin and unimpressive. Fleeting woody and oxidized finish.
"
1," Strong spicy nose, light orange color, huge head. Quick profile that has some lemon tones in it and ends with a peppery finish in the sides of the mouth. Smooth, well blended tastes and nice texture. Good hefeweizen.
"
1," On cask at the 2006 Atlanta Cask Ale Fest Very dark brown color with a small  tan head.  Big roasty aroma with coffee and some sweetness.  Flavor starts sweet but watery.  Light roast with a coffee finish.  Body is thin and watery.
"
1," Multiple samples over time. Pours dark brown with receding tan head. Nose has mostly caramelized sugar with subdued dark fruit. Sweetish flavor with backdrop of mostly dark sugar, mild bitterness. Lively mouthfeel with relatively clean aftertaste, compared to what youd expect from this sort of strong, dark ale. Still an immediately tasty beer, very likable, just not as contemplative as some of its cousins.

1," A nice summertime brew, pours a bright golden body with a small head that quickly dissipates. The little foam leaves tiny laced mazes all down your glass. a hint of lemon and a somewhat grainy flavor. On the label is a picture of a dude with a Flatop hairdo riding in a car.

1," If I could have only one beer (banish the thought !!) this would be it.  For me this is all what is right about beer, great flavor and color.  Their other beers are also great.
"
1," Deep, dark and rich. Liquid fruit cake, possibly....... My bottle was a bit unsettled, despite 3 weeks sat in a cool garage, didnt spoil the enjoyment though. A beer that commands respect and is impossible to do more than sip; the explosion of richness and strength on the tongue and back of the mouth makes sure of that.......
"
1," A dark black appearance with a moderate beige head. The flavor is slightly bitter with some chocolate and coffee present. This is different from the Winters Nip as this is more dry and less sweet. It has a definite smokey presence. This is pretty good stuff.
"
1," Draught at the Hamilton Place location. Pours golden with lacy white head. the aroma is sweet cookies, almond, trail mix, some dried fruit, and a hint of sweet pie spice. The flavor is doughy pilsner malt and slight almond. Herbal hops and a hint of tea come in, too. There is a bit of astringency in the finish, and after a few sips the aftertaste develops a harsh detergent bitterness.
"
1," 2007 Vintage. Pours muddy red/brown with a nice cream head. Nose is very expressive, unmistakably trappist. Caramel, chocolate, rum & raisin and a slight oaky nutty character aswell. Palate is a little more simple. Malt comes through early brining caramel/choc. Nutty/oaky character pops up again before hops and spicy phenols drive the finish. Great beer but not quite in the league of rochefort, st bern &amp;westy.

1," FEB 12, 2004 the last couple of times i've had this it's been disappointing. newish bottles of this aren't paricularly complex, the stewed pear in spices aroma and luscious texture are the main redeeming qualities
"
1," MAR 20, 2004 Pours dark brown with a slow dissipating off-white foamy head. Nice smells of raisin, fruit, spice. Lots of flavor here, nut, citrus, spice. This ale is always a treat.
"
1," Wow, very very great brew. This thing taste like what the Stone Vert. 06 should have tasted like. A hint of smokiness. Just enough for a really great flavor. This was very easy to drink for the 9% ABV. Definitely a great brew.
"
1," Nice subtle aroma.  Slight sweetness in the boday, but finishes a little dry.
"
1," Cask tulip at the brewpub - Jon Lang (head brewer) said he tweaked the Rust Belt Porter recipe adding more chocolate and other malts and therefore more body.  This is the BA version of that porter - Aroma is strong with bourbon, oak, chocolate and butterscotch.  Pours transparent dark brown with a medium cask head.  Flavor matches aroma with the flavors blending together and not being overpowered by the bourbon.  Palate is creamy and clean for a BA beer.  Tasty stuff.
"
1," Thin, fizzy, fast fading white head. Clear coppery amber body.	Light, dried Centennial hop aroma, along with some flowers.	Flavor is much the same subdued, smoothed out hops with a light sweet malty backing.	Not to interesting, but an okay average drinking beer.
"
1," Bottle 750. Everything you want from a dark Belgian strong. Tons of fruit, some light but not dominant spices, of course Belgian yeast. Good deal of tingly carbonation towards the back of the throat. I cant say I focused as much as I should have for ratings purposes, but Ive had a good number of these in my (as yet brief) day, and it was heaven to return to it after a long layoff.
"
1," (bottle, purchased at the brewery) Clear, pale golden colour with a big and slowly lacing foamy white head. Hops accented aroma, herbal and spicy with a light malty background. Moderately bitter flavour, light to medium bodied, crispy carbonation. Herbal hoppy taste with a balancing malty sweetness; bitter and slightly sweet finish with herbal, slightly flowery hops. Pleasant Pilsener.
"
1," Semi-murky red with rocky, diappearing head.  Apparent carbonation, smells of cherries, plums, alcohol and pepper.  Taste of largely the same.  Round-bodied, dryish finish.  Too fizzy.  But quite acceptable.
"
1," Pours honey orange with a head that quickly reduces to ring around the tulip.  Sugary citrus hop are initially a nice entrance, but they arent nearly well defined enough and become really mushy as the beer warms.  The earthy yeast also becomes more apparent, as well as the husky malt.  The hops become real resinous and bitter in the finish.  An OK attempt at the style, but in a the sea of fresh IPAs out there, this one sinks.
"
1," On tap at brewpub. Where is the fruit? I found this beer quite dull. The taste has nothing to envy to other beers of the same type.
"
1," Poured light brown with a thick off-white head that lasted very well indeed and laced thickly. Aroma of subtle clove and caramel malts with a complex spice character. Flavour was banana, subtle caramel malts, and some spice notes. I found the palate somewhat watery, although the low carbonation and bitterness were very nicely executed. This is a nicely restrained evening beer.
"
1," strong aroma and palate, fruity taste without the bitterness, and the body to match. Pedestrian drinkers might find it a bit intimidating, but in reality its actually not as uppity as one might assume.Chimay beers are sold in either 330ml capped or crowned bottles or 750ml corked bottles, and there is a distinct difference between the two. I was able to drink both versions but found the corked beer to be a bit superior. Ill discuss the differences throughout this review as applicable.POUR, COLOR AND AROMAIf poured from a 750ml bottle, there is quite a lot of kickback (which is due to the shape of the bottle and is completely normal). Out of a stubby, reverse funnel-shaped 330ml bottle, the beer pours much smoother.The body is a dark, murky shade of maroon or rusty brown, almost like iced tea. There is noticeable sediment due to the fact this is a bottle-conditioned beer which means the yeast is still at work even after the brewing process. If poured into an official Chimay glass (or a red wine glass or similar glass), the beer produces a fairly small layer of off-white, foamy head. It lingers for quite a while but will eventually disappear completely and leave no lacing.I noticed two different aromas. The corked bottle is much lighter in the nose with a sweet, fruity, malty scent. It indicates a lively palate. The crowned bottle is reminiscent of red wine with a sour, dry nose. The presence of alcohol is well-concealed by both versions.TASTEUpon my first taste of Chimay Red I was immediately reminded of a German-style doppelbock. Considering that this is a Belgian dubbel, it isnt surprising the styles are so similar (even though one is a lager and one is an ale).In the case of the 750ml corked bottle, the beer has a rich, malty character complimented by the taste of dark fruits (i.e. plum, raisin, fig). The taste is sweeter than I was expecting, almost sugary. The backend is slightly dry but the alcohol is never noticeable. Its tasty, to be sure, but its surprisingly mild.With the 330ml capped bottle I was immediately reminded of a red wine as soon as it hit my tongue. This version is drier and rather sour with a distinct grape-like taste. Interestingly, the finish is even sweeter with a candy apple-like taste. I dont think caramel malts are used in this beer but I did notice a caramel-like sweetness on the finish, although it dries out rather quickly. The taste is a little more intense here, but it seems more to-the-point whereas the corked version takes a roundabout path.FINISHBottle-conditioned beers tend to be more highly carbonated than other brews. The corked edition of Chimay Red has a slightly flat, thin, watery mouthfeel. There is definitely carbonation action present, but its a completely different type compared to that found in a macro lager. It goes down extremely smooth and is not a challenge to drink whatsoever.With the smaller bottle the finish was more or less the same, but with a seemingly more intense mouthfeel. The finish, while sweet, also leaves a dry, almost sour aftertaste and warms as it goes down. Its just about as smooth as its big brother, and certainly easier to drink than red wine.BODYI probably wouldnt consider a beer with an alcohol content of 7% ABV to be a big beer, although I think Chimays reputation might supersede its actual potency. In other words, Red Premiere drinks like a heavy beer because we assume it is one. This is ironic because the beer does not have a boozy taste to it unless allowed to warm to near room temperature. The drinker is unlikely to immediately feel the effects of the alcohol, but it will make its presence known in the end.FINAL THOUGHTSThe Chimay beers are roundly regarded as some of the best brews on the planet and for a beer critic to rate them at anything less than the best is probably consider blasphemy. While I would say I really enjoyed both versions of the beer I cant quite rate either versions among the best of the best. Despite the fact the palate to both beers is not as intense as one might expect, Id still consider Chimay Red Premiere to be an acquired taste. I highly recommend trying it, if only to see how well a beer can work as a wine substitute.NOTE"

1," Bottle 500ml. @ home.Unclear medium grey amber color with a large, frothy, good lacing, mostly lasting, grey off-white head. Aroma is light to moderate moderate malty, wheat, moderate yeasty, fruity, old bock alike, light banana, apple and phenol notes. Flavor is moderate to light light heavy sweet and light to moderate bitter with a average to long duration, phenol notes. Body is medium, texture is watery - creamly, carbonation is soft. [20100714]

1," Hazy, golden coloured, no head to speak of; very present estery-fruity nose (with almost a touch of turpentine), a bit tannic; sweetish, slightly sourish flavour with a fizzy MF, light bodied; slightly tannic (barrique), sourish finish with some sweetish-fruity notes. A very unusual brew, a bit like a heavily diluted ""Gueuze"".........
"
1," I like this beer a lot. Perfect pour.  Smells good, and taste great with no aftertaste.  could be a little more bold for my taste, but other then that, a damn good beer.
"
1," Tasted on tap at brewpub. This pale lager pours a very light gold color. Small sized white foamy head. Aroma is cereal and grain, a touch sweet. A medium bodied pale lager. Malts are fruity, cereal and grain. Mild slightly spicy hops. Mild flavors. Nothing annoying, Dry finish. It beat the heck out of anything BMC makes. Mouthfeel is thin. Finish is crisp and clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.
"
1," Very dark brown, very tall head.  Aroma is toasted malt and plenty of yeast.  Taste is a toast flavor, a bit sweet.  The sweetness lingers through the finish.
"
1," 330ml Bottle. Pours a dark, slightly hazy, reddish brown with a creamy beige head that dissipates fairly quickly to surface cover. Aroma is surprisingly light with notes of caramel, brown sugar, sweet spice and a lot of malt. Flavour is very similar but is also a bit nutty, with a hint of cola and toffee. Not as heavy as expected, considering the abv, with a short to medium finish which doesnt linger too long. Still extremely tasty and very easy to drink.
"
1, A highly roasted stout (and I mean HIGHLY roasted) balanced by fresh green hops.  Very good.	How
1," This is definitely not as exciting as the other Trappist offerings Ive had. Its not bad, but its definitely lacking complexity and texture. Pours a hazy medium red-amber color with a very large, frothy, off-white, quickly diminishing and mostly lasting head. The aroma is malty with moderate notes of toasted grain; hoppy with a light note of herbs and a trace note of lemon zest; yeasty with heavy notes of bread dough and light notes of damp basement; trace notes of orange zest, raw sugar. spicy alcohol. The flavor is moderately bitter, moderately sweet and lightly acidic with a longer-than-average, heavily alcohol, lightly bittersweet finish. Kind of an ichy soap/astringent aftertaste. The body is light, the texture is watery and the carbonation is average.
"
1," Cellar Reduction Night, Oct 20, 2007.  Thanks to Guerde!  Black color with no head.  Wickedly strong coffee aroma and taste.  Sweet malt taste.  Its pretty straight forward as a coffee stout.  Delicious.
"
1," Bottle 50 cl. Courtesy of yespr. Pours a clear dark brown with a reddish hue and a tall and lively beige head leaving some lacework. Aroma of pumpernickel and alkohol. Quite full-bodied with plenty of pumpernickel accents and roasted malt - actually also a whiff of burned malt. Some bitterness in the finish. Excellent. 141208
"
1," Bottle, courtesy of fonefan. Its a clear one, golden in color and with a thin layer of off-white bubbles. Lots of limejuice on the nose, so much its unpleasant. Not much else detected. Its sweet in the mouth, crashing with the sour lime, making me feel like Im drinking something made for mixing drinks. Sticky, effervescent and medium-bodied. Its drinkable, but I guess it should be mixed with some vodka or something. Blargh! 110128

1," Lively red amber body with a huge white head. Very nice yeasty aroma with lemon, spices, orange. Fully carbonated medium palate. Pleasant sweet yeasty flavour with orange and a nice bitterness, nothing extraordinary though. A very nice beer overall nevertheless.

1," Draught at Rock Bottom Charlotte, #428.   Mahogany pour with big quick dyeing head. Light malt aroma and flavor. Pretty good.
"
1," Dark brown body with a thin, light brown head that quickly goes away. Aroma is not that strong, hints of cereal and grass (?). Taste is a little bit bitter with yeast. Somehow reminds me of Finnish sahti. Mouthfeel is alright, it feels quite carbonated but soft. Aftertaste lasts for a while. I dont know if theres something wrong with my current sample but I recall liking this one more. I enjoy this but its nothing special, really.

1, Sinister Minister	Date
1," Sometimes those talented monks can hide a whallop of alcohol in a tasteful beer, but they couldnt do it with this one. The aroma and appearance were there but on the palate and while going down all I tasted was alcohol. Not a pleasant experience. I agree with Castle stick to the red.
"
1," Dark oarnge/light brown. Nice,creamy,long lasting head. Nice yeasty,malty aroma. Very creamy,fizzy,mouth feel. Feel great in the mouth. Starts musty and bready,rich. Chewy yeast follows,with fruity malt flavors. Finish is has the slightest bitterness,and is mainly malty. I've always enjoyed this one.
"
1," Sampler at the Nashville location - Poured a dark black/brown with an almost non-existent tan head.  Carbonation is very low.  Aroma is strong of roasted malts, but has an unpleasant sharp burnt smell (too much black patent malt?).  Flavor was also strong of roasted malts and, unfortunately the flavor of burnt malt and the accompanying astringency was definitely present.  Disappointing, given its reputation...
"
1," MAR 26, 2005 Have had this before, but shared another wih Shag tonight.  Black with a creamy, beige head and robust flavors of coffee and chocolate, roast, and a touch of sweetness.  Very decent stout, but wish theyd bring back the espresso stout...mmm, mm, m!

Body is medium, texture is oily to creamy, carbonation is soft. [20101001]
"
1," Dark brown beer, a classic with a reputation that often precedes a first tasting, which probably help to higher the drinking experience.  I think this beer might benefit from some aging; in a blind test with friends, it did not score outstandingly high, although it was amongst favorites.  Hidden sweetness, spices and sourness, for sure complex and interesting, not watery but neither an amazing texture.  I really want to cellar some for a few years and re-rate...
"
1," MAR 12, 2008 A brown 11.2 oz bottle poured into a Chimay goblet.  Pours an Amber brown/burgundy with a hearty off-white head that remains on the glass well after the beer is gone. A decent, light lacing.  Yeasty, malty goodness on the nose. A mild hazelnut sweetness mixes with a floral perfume and a hint vanilla for balance.  Malt and yeast are first on the palate with a sweetness that tastes more like caramel than anything on the nose. I also pick up some clove. Alcohol comes through stronger than I would have expected, but pleasant. No real hops to speak of.  This has a creamy carbonated feel. I dont think Ive used those two words together before, but the carbonation hits first, then it settles down into a medium bodied creamy Dubbel.  Another great Ale from Chimay. Theyre always a treat, in moderation; savor it.
"
1," Vom fass in the brewpub 22 Jun 07. Dark amber colored. An OK creamy head. Modest fruity aroma. Caramellish flavor. A bit watery. A roasted bitter aftertaste. Lot of lacing in the glass.
"
1," Creamy off-white head that holds well, smells moldy/yeasty with complex notes from King Alcohol; nice reddish-brown body with hazy appearance. Up-front lightly sweet with strong sour milk qualities. Banana, cola, prune, vanilla come together with a nice acidic/metal long finish. Carbonation is lively - not what I would consider a session beer, but fun.
"
1," Just because it is popular and readily-available doesnt mean it isnt a great beer! Chimay Red is a classic, flavorful Belgian that every beer drinker needs to try (several times if possible). Fruity, sweet and malty, Chimay makes a nice introduction for new Belgian drinkers due to its easy-to-drink character. Smooth, delicious, and suitably complex, it is a great standby Belgian.
"
1," Bottle.  Pours a hazy warm umber with a thin creamy head that lasted through the entire glass. Very pleasant light fruity aroma.  Flavors of caramel, malt, and a bit peppery. Very smooth. Almost creamy mouthfeel. Good stuff!

1," JAN 3, 2011 Clear reddish coloured beer with small white head and only few carbonation. Malty fruity aroma with some yeasty hints. Full sparkling palate. Finish is sweet bitter malty ending dry. (@WE)
"
1," Outstanding dark Belgian ale.  Flower aroma with a hint of alcohol in taste.  Drink often and easy to find in the wine-style bottles.
"
1," Think dark, stormy, full bodied, burnt malt, hint of Belgium chocolate. Surprisingly smooth for a dark ale that packs a punch in the alcohol stakes.
"
1," MAY 12, 2006 Pours a murky golden brown.  I definitely let some of the yeast on the bottom sneak in, but it still formed a decent thin head and looks like it has some serious substance.  The aroma is very winey.  Reminds me in particular of rieslings and other fruity whites.  I also pick up a bit of apple cider.  In the mouth theres some serious viscosI ity but rather than being sticky, this beer is slippery.  Strange, but not unpleasant at all, with good CO2 levels.  The flavors are a little harder for me to appreciate.  Admitedly, Belgians are not my favorite in general, so many strong sour flavors overload my tongue, but Im trying my best to be descriptive and positive rather than critical.  Definitely very strong grape flavors, incredibly winey.  Though it is dry in general, Id say theres a good deal of malt, with some roasty and smokey flavors shining through in an interesting way.  The alcohol definitely also makes itself known in the flavor.  Also, again, a bit of that apple cidery taste.  Perhaps Ive yet to have a good bottle of a Belgian, or maybe they are just too sour for me.  Overall, this was my favorite Belgian tried so far, but it has also been the least sour.
"
1," Appearance - Orange/red brown hazy, frothy white head quickly dissapates, minimal lacing on glass. Aroma - Fruity, some bread yeast, spicy, some alcohol, perfumy wheat, floral malt. Quite complex aroma.	Taste - Malt,  hint of spices, alcohol, wheat, slight acidic sourness (not unpleasant), a layer of sweetness. Spicy alcoholic warming malt finish with light bitterness.	The lively carbonation suits the beer. A very good beer (91/100) but Chimay Blue surpasses it as one of the megastars.
"
1," I am surprised that I havent previously rated this. This is the grand-daddy of Belgian strong ales. A very pleasant roasted malt taste with some fruit.
"
1," Could be worse. you could be struck down with thunderbolts. Not that bad. theres some more balls on this one than typical generic lager.
"
1," From a plastic bottle.  Generously shared by cquiroga.  Cloudy, light caramel colored pour with a wispy 		head of off-white.  Fruity nose of pears, apples, and coconut milk, along with hints of muscat grapes and musty 		leather.  Lots of fruity esters and a honey like sweetness provide an almost ""juice""-like base, funked up with 		some barnyard notes and peppery phenols.  Medium light bodied, lightly carbonated mouthfeel with a gentle, 		tingling effervescence.  Sweet white grape and waterchestnut flavors up front, along with some ripened pear.  A 		mild smokey nuttiness tries to peek in, but is drowned out by the light fruits and horsey funk.  The wildness of 		the beer seems to have taken over some of the other spice nuances; it would be enlightening to try a fresh example 		side-by-side.  Thanks for the rare treat, Chris!
"
1," cherries, yeast, raisins. The taste was a bit ordinary, but fruitiness and bitterness interplayed beautifully. A Trappiste for beginners.
"
1," Fantastic every time, and each bottle is always a little different.  Pours a deep brown with a thick tan head. Aroma is of caramel, pear, raisin/plum and a little vanilla.  Flavor is sweet with malts coming through that give it a nice earthy feel.  Medium body with a incredibly smooth velvety finish for a 9%.  An all around great beer and a personal favorite.
"
1," Alcohol evident.  Essence at first is of a red wine.  Very bready and yeasty.  Estery aftertaste with a dry mouthfeel to finish.
"
1," Pours a dark brown with a medium head. Light lacing. Aroma and flavor are malty and nutty with a tinge of chocolate.
"
1," 2006 bottle from MI2CA drunk on 1/11/07Cant figure out the bottling methods of these guys.  It says unfiltered/unpasteurized on the bottles, though it dosent say bottle conditioned.  The bottle of barrel-aged oatmeal stout was one of the most filtered, watery, loose tasting beers Ive ever had nor did it have any sediment.  This one, howver, has some definite protein dropout, which despite my best efforts got in to my glass, and the very last shot in the bottle (for experimentation) is completely cloudy.  The ruby-auburn-tinged caramel body is light on carbonation, though a fair amount of dark beige head does form, showing medium retention and little/no lacing.Sweet cherries and strawberries in the nose brush against the nose rather coarsely, while leafy, green hop aromatics provide grapefruit and orange rind notes.  Definite crystal maltiness sweetens things to a point, then seems to harden and dry out, with light yeast doughiness and moderate breadiness.  Every subsequent smell, however, is alive with fresh hop aromatics, fruity esters and balanced, sweet malt, it just seems to suffer on the finish, somewhat.  So based on the aroma, I suppose the evidence is in favor of it being unpasteurized at least.  Well have to leave it to the flavor/texture to determine the rest.Bittersweet malt and hops collide, with a strong earthiness and tangy grapefruit flavors that both give way to a ruby red grapefruit sweetness mixed with cherries and moderate herbal notes.  Whatever the medium malt being used, it comes across clearly and quite well.  The caramel-toffee sweetness is well matched and for once some hop acidity is much appreciated in balancing it.  Mostly substantial texture, with moderately engaging carbonation.  Ok, Ill buy that this stuff is lightly to not filtered and just conditioned well.  Not sure on the carbonation, I suspect its forced, but thats ok, Ill let them off the hook for that.  It comes across well enough.
"
1," Hazy reddish brown with a lively beige head. Raisins in the aroma, yeasty, spiced flavour leaves me wanting a little more presence. Medium body. Not bad. Bottle.
"
1," A delicate and complex brew. Smells of mint, a just-opened box of wooden matches, and yeast. Dark brown and well carbonated, this beer tastes of yeast, subtle berry fruits, and toasted oak. WOW!

1," Courtesy of Sammy fresh from the brewery. Pine, spruce and citrus nose. Taste to match! Nice palate and finish. Way too drinkable given the spice. Really good balance.
"
1," A good session brown. Slightly hoppy, nutty flavor thats a tad too watery, but fairly standard for a brown. Pours a light brown with a thin head and some good lacing. The malt character of this one actually is pretty good. Nothing too much jumps out about this one.

1," (swing top bottle) Clear, golden colour with a fluffy foamy white head, quite persistent, leaving lace. Citrus-fruity and slightly herbal hoppy nose with a light-sweet malty blend. Mild bitter flavour with a light but balancing sweetness, light to medium bodied, pleasantly soft carbonation. Soft malty, slightly strawy base with light herbal notes from the beginning; medium-dry, sweet-bitter finish. Very soft, but likeable Pilsener, probably a good session beer.

1," Bottle. Hazy light golden with a small head. Crisp aroma of grainy-bready malt, hops, hay, mild citrus, butter and honey. Full malty body, taste guided by malt with some citrus and honey, not too much hops but well balanced, light herbal hop bitterness in the finish. A great offering from Slovenia!
"
1," 330 ml bottle of the 2002 version.	Normally Chimay Bleue improves massively with aging, so I was looking forward to this one. It was a major disappointment! It began all right, as the beer poured a nice reddish brown with a good firm and lasting head. But the aroma was very faint, with only a bit of chocolate and some burnt flavours showing through. On the palate this brew appeared lighter than its 9% alcohol. The taste was very one-dimensional and again dominated by a burnt caracter. In short the beer appeared tired and worn out.
"
1," Pours deep nut brown with soft cream colored, medium-sized head.  Has an aroma of caramel malt and raisins with notes of citrus and spices in the background.  Taste begins with small fruit taste, followed by a sweet malt character and spiced footnotes, and finishes with a spiced abruptness.  Light-medium bodied and thin, lively feel.  Sudden finish leaves only a bit of fruit flavor lingering.  Great experience, really like this beer.
"
1," DEC 29, 2003 Excellent Belgian ale! Classic example of a trappist brew. Strong aroma of fruit. Very rich. Goes great with just any cheese or bread, although bries and camemberts round it out. Strong alcohol percentage but not overwhelming. Recommended.

1," 11.2 oz bottle.  Pours a reddish brown body with a small, bubbly white head.  Nose has caramel maltiness and champagne aromas.  Flavor is very bready with some caramel.  This is really the quintessential ""liquid bread"".  Nice medium thick palate.  Very nice beer.

1," Cloudy light-brown body with a long-lasting small beige head.  Fruity yeast notes of raisins on the nose.  Taste is all about the fruity yeast.  Prunes, raisins and grapes are the main fruity flavours.  The sweet malt-base feels more like maple sap than caramel.  Despite being very very fruity with grapes upfront the beer never gets vinous.  Fruity finish, a quick bitterness at the end is not enough to really pierce the fruity taste.  Very active carbonation with a little minerals touch.  Very good beer although this type of classic fruity Belgian ales is an over-crowded genre.  Classic.  My least favourite of the excellent Chimay line-up.  Always nice to go back to an old love as Orval and Chimay are two of the beers that turned me into good beers.  I was drinking Chimay back in the early 1990s.  Things were very different back then, there was a crazy G.W. Bush as president of the USA fighting a meaningless war in the middle east nevermind.

1," NOV 6, 2006 (Bottle BBE 2011) Yeasty, slightly caramel malty and slightly alcohol aroma. Red brown colour, hazy and large, light brown, slightly lasting head with good lacing. Yeasty, fruity, anise, caramel, bitter and slightly acidic flavour. Fizzy carbonated, full-bodied and slightly alcoholic palate. Excellent brew! 04/11/06 (original rating was 8/4/7/5/16)
"
1," Bottled.  Pours murky brown with a copper hue.  Hugh creamy tan head.  Aromas of sweet banana and a bit of skunk.  Creamy carbonation with flavor notes of prunes and/or raisins.  Just a bit of bitterness at the end with no alcohol warmth.
"
1," On draught at brewery (Charlotte location). It pours mahogany, with both a light head and suds lacing. The nose has some molasses, malt and tobacco notes. Flavors are interesting, of chocolate malt and light cloves. The finish is a slightly nut-bitter chocolate bark... clean and neat. The mouthfeel is light with a medium body and refreshing palate. Decently done.
"
1," a little overrated if you ask me. but still pretty good. malts, yeast and some caramel and fruit dominate the flavour. the colour was awesome, dark red. otherwise decent
"
1," Rich opaque maroon with a cream head, this beer had an effervescent, zesffully yeast aroma, not unsimilar to Paulaner Hefeweizen (it shares some qualities in mouthfeel and taste as well). This is a well balanced strong ale with a yeasty piny flavor that falls short of the expectations engendered by the aroma. Alcohol is well masked, yet its presence is felt. The finish is somewhat light, but this is a very nice brew, and one I will shortly try again and rerate.
"
1," The worst of the Chimay variations.
"
1," From bronze to brown color with a kaki cloudy head. This is very complex and flavorful. Deep smells of plums and yeast. Also floral and herbs notes. Spices touch my taste buds first then a complex taste of roasty malt, caramel and plums.  One of the best beer ever.
"
1," Small bottle pured into stemless snifter.  Nose is rich so much going on.  Dark fruits as well as sun dried fruits.  Some chocolate, smoke, leather.  Flavors of raisins dominate.  Dark roasted malt, coffee chocolate, somewhat thick palate.  Nice caramely bitter finish.
"
1," (bottle) Pours dark with a tan head. Had this towards the end of a tasting, and could easily smell the great aroma of dark roasted coffee.  Taste was all about the coffee, definitely a roast bomb, with a long lasting bitter finish of coffee.  This is what I look for in coffee stouts and this beer certainly didnt disappoint.
"
1," Wonderful color, aroma, and a nice chunky head.  tastes divine, I could have one of these for breakfast..
"
1," ooooo tasty times. extra smooth. right up there with coffe bender. jet black and grayish head i mean this stuff is steller man luckily i can get it in four pakks wo haaaaa
"
1," 33cl bottle. Pours amber with medium off-white head. Aroma is fruity and  caramel with some hoppy spiciness. Taste is mostly sweet with fruit notes. Hints of spices too. Finish is more bitter.
"
1," This was bought in Morrisons a while back, when poured it was VERY murky, almost opaque, head was ok tho! Flavourwise it was quite hoppy but overall it was unbalanced and, well...not very good! I bought a couple of bottles and both were the same, storage conditions perhaps?
"
1," Grande indeed. Aroma of raisins and caramelized sugar. Taste is less sweet, bringing in some hop bitterness. Excellent balance and complexity.
"
1," Bottle, corkd and caged. A prime example of the style. Long and tall, in all the right spots! The high octane of this ale is pleasant, even refreshing. A stellar drink!
"
1," strong with nice full flavor, very complex, with a spicy finish. nice to have every once in a while.
"
1," A growler (!!!) given to me at Foot Sex Day by my pal, StFun. Thanks, Josh!!! Amazing generosity from a superb fella. Anyways, I dug the hell out of this rich and sessionable beer. Big nose is just what I want, roasted coffee out the wazoo. Thick and black, with a big-ass foamy head. The body is moderate, perhaps even slightly too thin. The mouthfeel is chalky in a way I think is appropriate to style. Deep coffee flavors with dry dark chocolate too. Is it perhaps one-dimensional? Sure, but I actually want precisely this from a coffee stout in this style. Its not gonna replace Breakfast Stout but its damn fine. Thanks, bro!!!
"
1," Draft.  Hazy in appearance with a somewhat sweet aroma.  This in my opinion is an average IPA.  Not too bad though.
"
1," Used to drink this at the Dubliner in the Old Market in Omaha back in the day so I have a certain nostalgia for Chimay because  for me this was my first forays into what beer could be besides american lagers. Excellent aroma of caramel, cereal, toffee, nuttiness and a little floral. Moderately sweet with earthy roasted notes. Yeah Chimay still rocks.
"
1," Slightly hazed amber color with a modest head of dark cream colored bubbles. Sweet aromas, with pale malt, caramel, cream, orange zest, and pumpernickel. A lot of things in the aroma, but none of it comes together that well. Caramel and orange flavors dominate. Some floor cleaner qualities, such as Murphys Oil Soap. I am reminded of a stronger amber with a touch more hopping. Im just not getting it.
"
1," Deep, murky brown trappist ale with a huge tan, speckled head. Aroma is huge earthy malts, demerara sugar, nuts, plums, yeast, pie spice and hints of coco. Taste is dark fruits, bitter spices, sweet caramel, dark bread warming and complex finish. Body is chewy and smooth with fizzy carbonation that flattens and mellows as the beer is consumed. A classic example of a belgian strong ale.
"
1," Nice fruity overtones as I got deeper into my glass.  Balanced is the best word to describe it.  It gets better as it warms up...nothing about it really catches my attention.  Maybe a little too middle of the road.  Worth having anytime though.
"
1," Amber orange, beige head.  Aroma is citrusy, grapefruit, light spice, hops, sweet caramel.  Taste is citrus hops, caramel, light metal.
"
1," a marverlous beer with micro-bubbled spritz that rolls out a red carpet for caramel apple sweetness, dark malts and fruity bakery-fresh yeast, apple butter on brown bread.  bitterness bites deeply and will not quickly yield, but echos deliciously like a sweet song in a deep canyon-- with an accent that leans to orange zest.  alcohol component certainly has nothing to be ashamed of, and walks with power and dignity among the more popular malt-hop textural aspects.  in terms of entertainment, i'd put it on a level nearly with aventinus.  it's price is it's most conspicuous defect-- hopefully the benevolent monks are feeding children in africa with the two dollars that they've overcharged for this bottle.
"
1," Finally!  Inspired by an episode of ""The Thirsty Traveller"" that showcased Belgian beers featuring the Orval Monastery, Ive been hunting this beer down by the Pres Trappistes all over my town and finally found a place that had some in stock.  (Very popular ale among beer enthusiasts here, apparantly!)  Upon popping the cork, it pours a beautiful ruby colour with a thick, frothy, long lasting head and a caramel/fruity nose.  Fruit flavours are far more subtle than, say Hoegaarden white, no sharp citrus edge.  An excellent beer to appreciate.  (750mL bottle)
"
1," Opaque with a little ring of foam. Nose of chocolate and light ash. Flavor of caramel, chocolate and coffee. Medium body is smooth. slightly to the sweet side, and drinkably watery.
"
1," Simply... amazing. Had a small bottle in NYC last weekend, and... it was amazing complex, with a great aroma of mixed fruits and sugars. Amazingly smooth, easy on the palate. An excellent dark amber color... simply put, the best beer Ive ever had.
"
1," DEC 30, 2010 2010-12-29, vintage 2001, 9 years old, 6-4-6-3-12=31Brown color, hazy; generous head. Its lively but not overcarbonated. Dry aroma of caramel and dust. The body is slim, the mouthfeel is dry, with dry caramel flavor and some ashy feeling. Quite bitter. Nothing special.2009-12-31, vintage 2001, 8 years old, 7-5-6-3-13=34Hazy red-dark-amber color; very lively bottle, big head, creamy. Malt and caramel aroma, strangely its also corky. The body is not weak, but thinning, with good caramel flavor, but a bit old too; in the end the body is thinner; there is still some bitterness, but only from the dark caramel.More a curiosity than a good beer"
1," Pours a cloudy dark brown with a good head that quickly receeds. Nose is heavy on the alcohol with a large sweet tone to it. Small yeast edge to it. Taste is smooth and sweet with a malty undertone. Feel is bubbly. Probably the smoothest drinking BSDA I have had to date. Extremely drinkable. Even with a 9% ABV. Overall its good, but it isnt my favorite of the style.
"
1," prunes, dates, dark stone fruit [plum, cherry] on the nose.	dark brown/cola like a dark fortified wine colouration with lovely cream coloured head.	dates, chocolate and dark stonefruit flavours dominant with hints of prune and raisiny character aswell as some spice [cinnamon, nutmeg].	kinda dry and sumptuous with mild bitterness.	I definetly want more of this, this is a beer for quiet contemplation.
"
1," Nice bready and dark fruit aroma.  I like the flavor of this one.  Has notes of dark fruit, yeast, malt, and plenty of spice.  Nice balance of sweetness and bitterness.  Finishes crip.  Overall, a pretty good abbey dubbel.
"
1," 12 oz bottle.  Poured a dark brown with a thin tan head. The nose was very malty. The flavor was fairly smooth with hints of chocolate malts, a bit of oat, and a little coffee.  Not as smooth as a lot of this style are, but a decent beer.

"
1," Bottle Pitch black ale with a mid-sized, creamy, beige head. Fantastic retention. The aroma awards my senses with rich notes of toasted nuts, vanilla and bourbon. Full-bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and raspy carbonation. The flavor leans toward the bitter side of balance, but also offers moderately sweet vanilla, chocolate and coconut. Fairly bitter alcohol and charcoal finish. Bottle courtesy of MI2CA!
"
1," Draft at brewpub.  Darker amber color with virtually no head.  Pleasant citrus and piney aroma.  Promising hoppy initial flavor fades quite quickly to a smooth malty finish.  Medium to medium full body with a syrupy texture.  Very drinkable but the aroma led me to believe it would have even more bitterness.
"
1," An aroma which is fruity and a tad alcoholic leads into a flavor which is grainy and rather hoppy.
"
1," 750 ml bottle.  Pours cloudy burgundy.  Nice head dissipates quickly; leaves little lace.  Funky aroma (spice? yeast?), reminiscent of trois pistoles.  Bitter for a belgian - can't tell if it is hops or spice.  My favorite chimay - but Trois Pistoles is a a better value
"
1," Very nice Belgian. Had a fruity aroma, with an alcoholy dry finish that was great. As I let this one sit I liked it even more.
"
1," Okay, Im rating this on the strength of some 1995 vintage that I just had, which is an order of magnitude better than any food or drink that I have ever consumed.  Any beer with the potential to reach such greatness deserves such a rating, and it would get a solid 5.0 if it were like this all the time.  Incredible!!  Yeasty, champagnelike aroma.  Wine-ish, absolutely wonderful malty presence.  The complexity of this by far exceeds anything else I have ever tasted.  Where do I start?  Apples, pears, chocolate, prominent and somewhat Westvleteren-like yeast that I can still taste in my mouth an hour later.  I cant imagine how good this would be after 10 or 15 years.  RE-RATE #1"
1," First off, this was cellared for a year and a half (large corked bottle).  Poured a dark ruby red.  The head was the dark side of tan, going to lace after first showing up substantially for a minute or two.		Smells quite floral, sweet and fruity.  I have to make the comparison to Hoegaarden... its similar in aroma.  As it warms, the alcoholic notes waft up a bit more.		Nicely carbonated.  Mouthfeel is good and average.  Nothing amiss.		Tastes a bit woodsy with definite high alcohol notes.  Tart initially, then bitter towards the finish.  The aftertaste is a pleasant sour.  As it warms, you get a bit of vanilla.		I quite like this.  A nice one to bring out on special occasions.

1," Bottle. Pours an hazy orange-brownish colour. Bit sour wheaty and toasty aroma. Sweet, slightly sour, banana, wheaty and yeasty flavour. Bitter-sweet finish.
"
1," SEP 10, 2010 Best of the Chimay beers. Very nice flavour, and aromas that are a pleasure to smell.		Edit"
1," Murky orange-brown with tan head.  The head stayed till the end.  Sour yeasty aroma with some sweet notes.  Palate was a surprise with maltiness, caramel, lots of carbonation and yeast.  To me its an honest well-made beer.
"
1," 15.10.2011. 0,75l Bottle. Golden orange colour with a large off-white head. Aroma is malty. This beer is sweet and strong with mild smooth bitterness. Flavours of yeast.
"
1," Growler shared by Scott.  Pours out dark brown with a faint tinge of burgundy.  Small tan head left some lacing for as long as it lasted.  Aroma was roasted coffee, some notes of chocolate, malt powder.  It was a bit thin in the mought and low in alcohol for a porter.  The flavor was pleasant.  The coffolate combo with a smathering of malted milk balls.  Nice drink.
"
1," Enjoyable.  A bit cloudy and yellow with some white around the edges with a large foamy head.  It has the aroma of a typical belgian wit, its yeasty and spiced.  The flavor is crisp, biting, and citrusy.  There is a full wheat malt flavor and feel and several spices are noticable.   Barley Island continues to impress me with their beers.
"
1," Bottle.  from a sixer of trappist beer.  Not among the best in the pack, but very good overall in its own right,  Minimal head, nice dark body.  Taste is of yeast and spice with a bit of oak barrel hint.  Excellent atertaste with a tint of alcohol
"
1," Aroma of.plums, yeast and malts.  Pours a hazy red with a bubbly head.  Tastes of sugar cane, wheat and tasty yeast.  Its the tastiest glass of bread Ive had in a while.
"
1," A red abbey dubbel that is somewhat inferior compared to the other Chimay beers.
"
1," The date stamp on the cork is 03/07.The beer was poured into Chimay glasses and produced a thick off-white head. The head eventually dropped to 1/4 inch but never faded totally. The beer is a highly-carbonated bright amber orange, and its quite attractive. (Food should please the eyes as well as the palate.) The aroma is surprisingly hoppy with a underlying sweet malt and hints of fruit. The aromas are precursors to the flavor palette. A complex blend of hoppy, fruity and yeasty. There are a range of spices lingering in there as well; pepper, cinnamon are noted. A faint candy sweetness waits in the background. The aftertaste has some drying bitterness with peachy fruitiness in the end. I found the alcohol to be very well-masked.
"
1," Immensely drinkable.  However, my expectations were not quite met.  Pours dark brown with a light head that dissipates almost immediately.  Perhaps the greatest asset of this beer is its impeccable balance, although I was hoping for more of a ""wow"" factor.
"
1," My favorite of the Chimays as well. Has a great depth of flavor without being overpowering. Cloistered rooms, even a suggestion of fruit, maybe apples. Lots of memories in this bottle for me.
"
1," MAY 15, 2008 Aroma"
1," bottle-pours a cloudy dark brown with a frothy tan head...aroma is slitly bready and sweet...tast is cabonated and sweet with fruity overtones and a nice alcohol kick....leaves that palat with a good aftertast...this is a really good beer i recomend it to anyone who likes high alcohol and full flavor....
"
1," Its one of the best beers that I have ever tried. If you visit Belgium - try this beer!
"
1," True black body is topped by a thick chocolate milk foam head. The sticky froth chunks the side of the glass. Bourbon, vanilla and chocolate dominate the aroma. Theres a chocolate milk flavor thats really interesting. Slight char. Its a bit like a white russian made with chocolate milk. The stout is a good base, but could stand to be a bit more assertive as it gets lost in the bourbon by the end of the bottle.
"
1," Bouteille de 750 ml. Armes de levure belge lgrement fruite, de caramel et de chocolat. Robe brune aux reflets rouges, translucide et avec une belle effervescence. Bien ronde en bouche, un caramel bien prsent accompagne des touches de chocolat et des fruits mrs (pruneaux, raisins). Finale lgrement sucre et prsentant une touche alcoolise.	Trs bon.
"
1," FEB 14, 2008 This is ok, but not as interesting as expected.  Its rather fizzy, slightly murky, dark reddish brown.  It has a big light tan head that steadily dissipates to a thin ring and leaves only weak lace.  The aroma is yeast, orange peel, hints of clove and banana, almost like a blend of the aromas of barleywine, Duvel, and a German hefeweizen.  The taste is dry at first but then becomes rather sweet.  Its quite alcoholic from start to finish with a German dark hefeweizen quality along with prunes, dry 7-up, alcohol, whole wheat bread.  The finish is mostly of prunes, alcohol, and a soft hint of whole wheat bread.  It has some similarities to Bush de Noel, but clearly not as strong or pungent, etc.  Its ok, but I dont see much goind on her, its rather boring without being crisp, etc.
"
1," Pours a dark yellow color, with a slight head. Has alot of carbonation, with hints of different fruits. Kind of bitter aftertaste.
"
1," Cask at Bow Bar Edinburgh ... Nice copper colour ... light fruity malt nose ... sweet toffee little metalic hop in linger.
"
1," Like most said smoke/spice.  Dark pour amber head.  Lots going on. Flavors of raosted malt some charamel.  noted some raisins/chocolate.  Good brew.
"
1," MAR 9, 2008 Date"
1," An amazingly complex brew that took a little getting used to for me.  A solid whack of plum or raisins in the aroma.  It poured to give a nice off-white head that lasted fairly long despite the high alcohol content.  Unfortunately in Australia beers tend to be served extremely chilled, after letting it warm up a little the alcohol was still powerful and a bit harsh.  Once the beer warmed up further the flavors seemed to come to more of a balance and the fruity/malty flavors cut a bit of the alcohol bite.  Very long lasting finish with not much bitterness.
"
1," Berries/grapes in the aroma, odd for this style, although not quite for what it was aged in.  The flavor is dominated by the berries/grapes with some decent maltiness thrown in.  Although it might be good further down the road if aged, this had far too much berries/grapes for this style, it dominated the flavor and it should have been more subtle.
"
1," Almost like a port, for aging in your cellar. Can be kept for more than five years, if you can wait that long! Trappist-style Ale with a medium-sweetness, sents of pepper, thyme and nutmeg in the finish. Delicious with blue cheese !
"
1," This is the most impressive beer I have ever poured. Pours a nice amber-brown with a very thick foamy head that will not go away. Looks like a latte head. The taste is well rounded, but a little sweet for my tastes. This is what all beer should LOOK like. Still a little too nutty & malty. Hops do just enough to overcome the mentioned shortcomings and cut it to become a decent tasting beer
"
1," Nice body and appearance. Fruity and malty to the end. Good example of Belgian Strong.
"
1," Not sure what style of beer this is meant to be, on tap in Chattanooga.  Solid red-brown with an off white foam.  Aroma is fruity, dark plums, berries, sweet malt.  Taste is very sweet, nutty malt, caramel, toffee, dark fruits.
"
1," Fairly fruit flavored beer that mixes well with  yeast. Slightly bitter aftertaste, but refreshing.
"
1," copper-brown in color, somewhat hazy, head retention is less than optimal for style.  aroma is complex and malty, but somewhat weak.  definitely some alcohol warmth in the flavor, but that is to be expected.  high carbonation, little to no aftertaste.
"
1," mmmmmmm, my first trappist and not the last. A great strong flavoured beer. A slight chocolate flavour. An amazing beer!!!
"
1," Bottle, thanks to Michael from the Bottleshop, Idar-Oberstein! And thanks to Bierkrug for logging the beer on RB! Nice golden color, massive white head, good lacing. Taste is pleasant, banana, slight bubblegum. Very refreshing. Mild aftertaste - a very nice Hefe.
"
1," Pour is a bright yellow with a fizzy white head.  Aroma is noting really maybe some grain.  Flavor is sweet malts with a grassyness toward the end.  Nothing really horrible about this beer and worth a try just for the novelity alone.
"
1," 75cl bottle bottle code LAN-591.  Served in a Chimay glass.  The nose hase an ever-changing combination of fruity notes, malty aromas and a delicate yeastiness.  This fine ale is a cloudy brown, with a coarse bubbled head that rose rapidly and fell just as fast. Then, 	like a phoenix from the ashes, a small fine bubbled head arose and fell yet again. No lacing.  The palate is full-bodied and well carbonated.  The flavor leads with Initial maltiness, sharpness and carbonation sting which fades to a mild, caramelly note, and finishes with a 	lasting, mild bitterness.   There is a touch of residual malt sweetness, but it is subtle and never cloying.  A little acidity is evident, and the alcohol is well hidden.	Later, as the beer settles, the fruity nose dominates, the sharp edge fades, and the beer becomes all the more enjoyable.
"
1," Had on tap at the Nashville location as Winter Porter, given the new designation of a Winter Bock it seems like the Winters Nip designation isnt so much a beer of its own anymore, only a seasonal name.  So Im putting this here.  Dark brown-red, dark tan head.  Roast aroma, sweet and bitter chocolates, cocoa, caramel sweetness.  Roasty, chocolate taste, full body.  Light roasty bitter astringent finish.
"
1," A fine eggshell head of persisting foam tops the dark brown limpid liquid with plentiful good fine bubbles.	At first closed (cellar temperature is 14 C), opening to a breadlike aroma with some spice, pepper.	Foamy in the mouth, with an intense and full flavor, licorice, quite hefty structure.  Good balance between sweetness, body and alcohol, not as overtly herby/hoppy as the Chimay Premire/Red I had yesterday, with a quite heavier body and licorice type predominance, but also some musty bitter in the end.	Quite a mouthful, but not as expressive as the Chimay Premire/Red which I found to be the better beer.
"
1," 330 mL bottle from the LCBO, poured in a branded Trappist glass. Pours cloudy copper-brown with a tall, frothy tan head. A few particles of sediment made their way out of the bottle. Head slowly fades but laces well. On the nose, aromas of apricot and peach with flowers, yeast and a touch of spice. Flavour is moderately sweet throughout with the slightest touch of bitterness. Notes of candied fruit and medium-roasted caramel malts. Finish is long and sweet with a hint of nutmeg. On the palate, medium in body and ultra-smooth in texture. Well-carbonated with fine bubbles. Not as complex as some other dubbels, but a beautiful malty composition. Complex and inviting in aroma, this beer does not disappoint. 2010-03-20
"
1," Rated at the Pewaukee Tasting II 5/5/07.	Appearance  dark brown, modest head	Outstanding coffee aroma, but flavor and body are frankly more than a bit underwhelming.
"
1," Chimay is always a win/win selection of beer. The Peres Trappistes 330ml poured hazy brick red/brown. Carbonation attacks the palate waking it up to the sweet belgian spice and malt which Immediately follows. Dont rush into this one, let it sit to the proper Abbey Dubbel temperature 54-57degrees to get all the flavors. Its well worth the wait.
"
1," Bud Lite is a much better beer. I think that says it all!
"
1," warming alcohol, plum, raisin, port wine, caramel sweetness and a hint of licorice - and it mingles well into a higher and well balanced unity. I have a few bottles in my cellar, put away for maturing. Yet another good example that out taste develops in our journey in to the world of beers...
"
1," Great tasting and wonderfully thick.. very dark with a bitter taste that gets better as you go along.
"
1," Bottled. A black beer with a lazing tan head. The aroma has notes of sweet matl as well as lighter notes of roasted malt. The flavor is sweet malty with light notes of roasted malt, leading to a dry roasted finish.
"
1," JUN 19, 2008 Dark  brown with light foamy head.  Figgy malty on the nose, which is flowery/hoppy as well.  The taste itself is flowery/yeasty with a warming tinge from the alcohol-which is present, but not overwhelming.  There are some fruity elements, berries, pears and peaches, each becoming more pronounced as the beer progressed.  There is a light spicey-sourness, but it is farily well integrated into the whole of the beer. The body is smooth with a drying touch at the end.  This one certainly has a lot of complexity.
"
1," slightly hazy, deep golden, small, quickly diminishing white layer, light sweet-malty and fruity nose with a discreet bitterness in the wings; light bodied, light to moderate bitter-sweet flavour; watery-malty finish with a touch of anchovis in the aftertaste. Not good, poor.....
"
1," Cask Stillage at the New Century Hall, National Winter Ales Festival Manchester 19/01/2008	Some fruit aroma. Amber coloured and very strong in alcohol with some bitterness and pale malt in a crisp and dry finish.

1," Bottle looks really good. Beer in the glass deep golden, nice head. Starts hoppy and dry, a bit sourish, strong, a bit grasy. Finish not really balanced, grasy-sourish. Average!
"
1," Draft. Pours gold with a thin white head. Light floral hoppy aroma with some grainy malty notes. The flavor had a light grainy sweet base with light floral hoppy notes. Not bad.

1," One of the best beers I have tried. Amazing start to finish. I was served this slightly chilled and man was it awesome!

1," From bottle pours a cloudy coppper brown. Mild aroma of spice, Thick frothy head, disapates fairly quickly. Taste of dried fruit and apricot, sweet. Oily texture and lively carbonation. Pretty good, i like it allot more than Chimay blue
"
1," Bottle courtesy Degarth. Pours black with a small tan head. Aroma of bourbon, roasted malt, and licorice. Taste is the same as aroma. Medium mouthfeel with a mild to moderate amount of bitterness. Very good.

1," Dark fruit, smokey swallow, very smooth.  Very good.  Saved for a celebration--our rugby team made playoffs.  Markup is so outrageous I doubt I'll be having another one soon.  =(
"
1," JUN 26, 2005 Bright amber colour.  Light bitterness, a fair dose of crystal malt chewiness, and light mango/papaya esters.  Slightly sticky finish.  As with the Narwhal, it is a subtlely complex ale with a distinct Howe Sound imprint.  Good on them for using a fun yeast, too.
"
1," caramel and toasty malt, doughy yeast, spicy phenols. Alcohol is more pronounced to the point of being full-on in the finish. All in all the taste is very nice, but it is a shame about the alcohol.	Carbonation is good"
1," 330 mL bottle.  Golden red amber with a big fluffy off-white head.  Aroma of fruit and yeast.  Silky some what sticky paltae.  Light fruity taste, molasses, a hint of brown sugar, and a slightly bitter finish.
"
1," Nice de750 ml bottle. Nice aroma upon opening. Color is deep amber with some cloudiness from yeast. Aroma has a lot going on. Im getting strong maltiness mixed in with some dark fruity esters such as raisin and/or dates. There are also some spicy phenols in the background, but not overpowering. Tastes very nicely balanced between malt, esters and spice. Very easy on the palate. Not as thick as expected. Overall, a top notch dubbel.
"
1," This was the first Belgian Ale I ever had not to mention Tappist. Thus commenced my happy journey down the hoppy highway through the bourgs of beer from Belgium. I sometimes like to decant it, others drink it all. Only because of the health benefits, mind you. The color is an intriguing dark. The head wasnt huge that I recall. The flavor was the same way, especially with the yeast. Gave it a bit of a nutty quality to contrast with the vineous malty character. Superb beer. An all-time fav. Too bad theyre jacking up the price so high that Bodega cant carry it anymore. Wahhh....
"
1," Bottle - pours a dark red/brown with a large fluffy head. Aroma is slight caramel and alcohol. Flavor is caramel, brown sugar, slight yeast. Your mouth is left feeling like there is a slight film in it. This is a very good beer and something even non-beer drinkers can enjoy.
"
1," Not as good as the Blue, IMO. Nevertheless an excellent, heavy beer. If youve had any variety of Chimay before you will recognize the flavor immediately. The Red tastes more reasonable than the Blue in terms of yeast and texture.
"
1," Un col montagneux se dpose pour quelques instants sur un liquide brun caramel.  Au regard, les bulles sont nombreuses et assez fines.  Au nez, le malt grill, le sucre brun et quelques fruits se mlangent  des pices comme la muscade et le poivre blanc.  Au got, amalgame de la levure, dpices et de fruits sur une base malte.  Prsence lgrement sentie des houblons.  Ptillant en bouche, le liquide possde une rondeur approprie pour le style.  Longue finale pice avec un alcool qui rchauffe sans tre brlant.
"
1," Very dark brown, 90-95% opacity, some red, rich coffee-cream head.  Very smooth, very dry, thorough roasted notes, dark, toasty, not burnt, little bitterness, light touch of vanilla.  Exceptionally easy drinking.  Not multi-layered for flavor but simple and enjoyable. (on tap, Rock Bottom Atlanta)
"
1," Hazed amber hued straw body fills the glass well.  Smells like old socks.  Light bready malt backbone.  A little ripe pear.  Not bad.
"
1," Bottle. Dark pour. filmy white head. light lacing. Bland aromas of caramel, toasted malts, some faint chocolate and sweet almond. Taste is similar. Faint toasted notes, some caramel and not much else. Slightly bitter finish. Not bad. not great. I probably wouldnt buy again but I would try it off tap.
"
1," 3oz sample at the brewpub Downtown Chattanooga. Dark roasted brown pour with a nice head. Bold Coffee malt (like in Malta!) with a rich roasted flavor that stays with you! Great!

1," Another in the series of bourbon-barredl aged beer from Barley Island.  A deep garnet body with a thin, tan head.  The aroma is really cool.  There is some vanilla, coconut and whiskey, all in very subtle states, atop a strong base that seems to be like a real porter.  Coffee, chocolate, slightly sour milk, and no strong roasted character.  There is a nice smooth, thickness to the beer that is not overbearing, but also not the consistency of motor oil.  The flavor shows more of the slight sour milk, the bitterness of the dark malts and the light sweetness of the residual sugars mixed with the barrel aging.  While not as good as the Oatmeal Stout, still quite enjoyable.
"
1," In the 750 mL bottle at the 2006 Huber Haus Belgian Trappist Ale Tasting. Pours a cloudy rust red with a thick pillowy off white head consisting of fine bubbles. The aroma is not very strong- faint raisins and berries. Has a sweet mild chemical rings the tongue. Astringent and drying at the end. Has a thinner body than I expected. The finish is a mild bitterness, but rather drying from the mild tartness.
"
1," One of the most attractive beers I have ever had the pleasure to pour, but it looks a lot better than it tastes, I will admit.  Although it has the lowest alcohol percentage out of the Chimay family, it has a surprisingly overwhelming taste of alcohol.  Its worth trying out (even if its just for aesthetics).
"
1," Dark brown with red hints, a thick tan head.  Light loops of lacing.  Roasty aroma, big chocolate.  Taste is roasty, lightly astringent, chocolate and coffee.
"
1," on tap at brewpub. pale yellow-purple with a small but decent pink-purple head, some retention, strong lacing. spicyness, acidity, herbal-citrusy light to medium hopping. average carbonation, light body. unpleasant fresh or fermented whole blueberries.
"
1," (swing top bottle, courtesy of Quack-Duck) Clear, dark brown colour with a ruby shine and a medium-sized tanned foamy head. Sweet toast-malty and slightly bready aroma with caramel, earthy notes and a tinge of herbal hops. Sweet and slightly bitter flavour, medium bodied with a smooth carbonation. Robust toast-malty taste with an almost oily mouthfeel, accompanied by caramel, earthy notes and light herbal accents; quite dry, slightly sweet and bitter finish with a lasting caramel-toasty aftertaste. Quaffable Dunkel. 31.XII.09
"
1," On tap seasonal at Big River Grille, Nashville.  Pours dark red amber colour, leaves a little head and lacing.  Aroma and flavour are on the malty side, but mild.  Mild for an Irish Ale.
"
1," Bottle thanks to thirdeye11. Pours with a tan head and a deep brown body. Aroma of windex, cedar, wood, belgian yeast, light bugs, pine and brown sugar. Taste is raw grain, wood, tannic and just kind of odd and off tasting. Light bubbles and a dry finish for a quad. Alcohol is decently well hidden. Second bottle rate (maybe it didnt make the transition from kegs to bottles well on this batch).
"
1," Hazy dark brown colour with a nice creamy head.	Aroma of rasins,citric,malty,and a nice hopy nose in the end.	Flavor is citric sparkling feeling on the tung.Vine, and malty. Nice medium to long finish. A classic Belgium beer. Fantastic!
"
1," Grande Rserve Magnum courtesy of Dumdum, 1998. Red amber in colour, ruby hues, with a nice moka head. Fruity raisins in aroma with aplles and light yeasty notes. Sweet confectionners sugar with woody notes and old hops. This beer is past its prime, notes by high oxidation. Still interesting.
"
1," Absolutely marvelous.  The flavor is perfectly balanced with just enough sweetness and just enough hoppiness.  This is in spite of the high ABV.  Thank God for trappists.
"
1," Notes from Indy Winterfest		Pours black with tan head. Aroma is of coffee and grains.  The flavor is like coffee grounds, chocolate, and malts.  Palate is normal.  Overall, an ok stout.
"
1," Thanks to yem25 for the bonus.  Pours a velvety black from the bottle with a faint brown head.  Smells of powdered cocoa and slight bourbon.  Tatses predominantly of roasted coffee, sweet cocoa, and mild vanilla.  Smooth and balanced, but not very complex for a barrel aged stout.
"
1," From the Jug at the GABF Colorado Convention Center, Denver 10/10/2008	Fruit and whisky aromas. Small beige head. Black and rich on the palate with some alcohol present. Creamy and slightly bitter coffee roast finish.

1," Appearance is orangish with no head. Flavor is slightly hoppy with some malt. Strikingly similar to Sam Adams Boston Lager. Nice beer.
"
1," MAR 18, 2007 Dark red/brown with red highlights and a big head.  Smells like raisins.  Tastes like raisins as well with other fruity and malty characteristics.  Slightly bitter finish with a hint of red wine.  I need to drink this more but I actually think I prefer the other two Chimays if you can believe that.
"
1," JUL 21, 2008 11.2oz bottle. About time I rated this beer. Aroma is raisins, prunes, red wine, vanilla, yeast, hints of earthiness, some brightness. Served @ 61 in a Chimay chalice. Pretty dark copper, nearly brown color with a two fingered head a top. The Chimay glass allows me to pour the entire beer into the glass, dregs and all. Taste is huge malt, dark fruits, vanilla, some tartness/acidity, and some warming alcohol. Nice mouthfeel, seems full and not just from the carbonation, but easy to drink. The finish is lingering dates, cinnamon, some earthy hops and some moderate bitterness and alcohol presence. I remember being perplexed and amazed the first time I had the beer and for a good reason; A classic.

1," FEB 5, 2006 Rerate 5/7/05"
1," Hazy orangey yellow with big and intense pale head. Nose is soft, gently wheaty and spicy. Same dry, earth like aroma as in Chimays port salut. Flavor starts malty and soft, but finishes dry and chalky with some hops and peppery spiciness. Very appetizing. Mouthfeel medium to full bodied with quite strong, but smooth carbonation.

1," Im not a big fan of Big River or their beers. Its not that they are bad. Its just that Ive never had a particularly good beer or meal there. The Ironhorse Stout is probably my favorite beer so far at Big River. Very drinkable and maybe even too light. This guy is smooth and actually fun to drink. Typical stout coffee and roast notes. Not as much fruit as some, but unique enough at least by Big River standards. I dig it.
"
1," JUN 7, 2008 2007 bottle shared by beastiefan2k.  Deep brown beer, thin fast fading head.  Aroma is lightly licoricey with a light plumminess and a soft grapey vineousness.  Lean dark malts, but not a lot of roast.  Lightly spicy with a little bit of apple sweetness.  Pretty decent brew. 	7 3 7 3 14	Bottle shared by eyedrinkale.  Brownish black with a light brown head.  Sweet and slightly toasty aroam.  A bit of light corianderish spiciness and some sweet nutty/chocolatey malts.  Lightly spicy and yeasty with a bit of molasses on the back.  Chewy and a bit of lightly leathery flavour as well.  Quite a tasty brew.
"
1," Growler from Hippie4beer.  Thanks Seth. I had to drink this right away (chilled in the freezer) cuz it leaked a little in shipment.  Help up pretty well though- lost most of the carbonation obvously.  Pours a slight haze very light amber. Aroma is light sulfer, lots of yeast, and mildly hoppy.  Flavor is lightly yeasty, light solvent, light sulfur, sharp caramel malts, moderatley hoppy and a nice somewhat harsh bitterness.  Pretty good, but I bet would be even better fresh on tap.  Thanks Seth! Shame I couldnt share this with any other ratebeerians for them to rate.
"
1," These labels are just too busy; I like the information but this is ridiculous. Hazy dark orange pour, looks thick for the style. Somewhat diminishing white head. Aroma is big on salty grapefruit. Also noted are grassy hops, tangelos and dry malts. Smells nice enough, somewhat boring but very unique. Flavor is nice if not uninteresting. More fruit, now more like fruit juice, big orange rind and a little pepper. Finishes off dry. The palate is very nice, carbonation is complimentary. Medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall a very satisfying pale ale.
"
1," Aroma of chocolate, almonds and caramel. Appearance is light brown with tan head. Flavor matches the nose, with an emphasis on the caramel. Palate is creamy. Alright.
"
1," Classic blue corked bomber. Appearance is solid oak brown with an inch of thin, light brown head. Aroma is toasted malt, burnt sugar and doughy yeast. Taste is very similar to the aroma. It begins with big caramel and toasted malt flavors followed by doughy, spicy yeast and candied figs. Theres also an earthiness to the Ale that adds great complexity to the overall flavor. It finishes extremely smooth with a very subtle brown sugar and rum aftertaste. World Class Belgian Strong Ale not to be missed.
"
1," Deep golden pour with an off white head.  Sweet aroma of honey and spices.  Smooth sweet taste with honey and fruits with a good amount of carbonation.  Had an almost frothy finish.
"
1," Excellent brown color, almost copper, with a nice frothy head. Less complex than other trappists and slightly bland (comparatively), however this makes it much easier to drink. I didnt have to spend my time deciphering its many flavors and was able to enjoy the whole bottle. Easy to drink and very smooth. A slight bitterness develops with warmth, building to a sharp finish. Very nice.
"
1," Pours amberish-red with a thin, foamy, mostly receding tan head. Aroma of clove, light toffee, mildly fruity yeast. Taste is yeasty, fruity, toffee, clove, and bubble gum. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and foamy with lush carbonation. Quite enjoyable, but not stellar.
"
1," Incredibly complex array of flavours, roasted malts, toffee and caramel, hints of dark chocolate and coffee. Huge alcohol hidden amongst the complexity. One of the top beers in the world. One to be savoured and sipped with good company. People who complain about it being too expensive should go back to drinking their megaswill in their trailer park. At around A$16 for a 750ml its cheaper than an average bottle of wine.
"
1," No aroma. Pale yellow in color. Little head. Good lace. Diacetyl notes. Could pass for a blonde ale. Not bad. Fresh. Crisp. Light hops. No flaws.
"
1," ( 500ml bottle, courtesy of blutt59 )  Pours a cloudy amber body with a tall aggressive (gusher) off-white head.  Aroma of wheat, banana, and light chemical.  Flavor of wheat, clove, pear, and banana.
"
1," Small bottle.Dark burgundy color.Hazy.Sweet dark fruit,black cherry,red grapes are present in the aroma.Light sweetness early, turning slightly bitter.Dry finish,well carbonated.Very good.
"
1," Dark coppery colored with light brown head. Very light fruit aroma. Not a really strong fruit flavor or taste in general as other trappists.
"
1," Excellent! Complex yet very well balanced. Starts with	a malty, bready aroma supported by a cloudy brown color.	A malty-yeasty taste with hints of dried fruit. Considering	its complexity this is light and quick. Fantastic.
"
1," 11.2oz bottle. Aged 5 months. Nearly exploded on me when I opened it, disturbing all the yeast, so I got a rather yeasty pour and cant say what the clear brew is like.  Pours a very dark brown, almost black. Off-white head. Smell of Belgian yeast. Slight hayish flavor with that yeast REALLY taking over in the end. A very good beer if it werent for my unreadiness for secondary fermentation and lousy pouring technique.
"
1," Sampled at Viti, pours pale yellow. Generic lager, slightly smoother and more robust than the average run-of-the-mill macro piss.
"
1," clear yellow, sooth white head.	mild bitter ipa aroma.	flavor is hoppy, sweet, good malty base.
"
1," Bottle, gusher. Brown/red color with a tan colored head (about two fingers) which unfortunately almost immediately disappears. Very little lacing. It starts out cloudy, a bit like murky water. Subtle aroma, which oddly reminds me of autumn leaves and dried fruit. Taste is soft bitter, combined with some sweetness like sugarcane. Feels a little bit thin in the mouth, light-medium body and a nice soft carbonation which fills your mouth; nice. Quite a long finish which brings some more flavors, but leaves me thinking of something slightly oxidized. I like this kind of carbonation, but overall I cannot see whats so great about it, I prefer other dubbels.
"
1," One smooooth trap. A dark caramel color and a wonderful malt flavor. The perfect hop character.
"
1," the bottom end for chimay, but light-years above many others
"
1," Brown coloured beer with small white head and medium carbonation. Fruity sweet aroma. Full sparkling palate. Finish is roasted sweet with some nice spicy touches and hoppy hints. Nice one!
"
1," (300ml bottle, courtesy of mar)  Pours an opaque milky body with chunks.  Flavor of sour milk, vanilla wafers, sweat, Elmers wood glue, and plastic.  Flavor of coconut milk, lactic sourness, and some florals.  Nasty.
"
1," Draft at Downtown Chattanooga location		The winner of the 8 different ones I had, this was the one I could have drank all day. Nice citrus aroma, and the flavor was almost perfectly balanced between a great malt character and a crisp hoppiness. Nothing ground breaking but this particular pint was nice.
"
1," If all Belgian Strong Ales tasted like this one, I would probably like them more.  This is beautifully dark brown (almost black) with an off-white (almost Guiness color like) head.  It shows off sweet, yeasty aromas and has rich flavors of organic root beer, peat moss and alcohol.  It seemed to have extra carbonation accompanied by a full and creamy feel.  Scrumcilicious!
"
1," Pours a burnt brownish color with a nice tan head.  A salty almost meaty nose with hints of toffee, chocolate, and a spicy yeatiness.  A nice creamy mouthfeel that brings me back to Belgium when I consumed way to many goblets of this deliciious spicy, ripe fruit, and slight alcohol burn nectar of the gods.

Palate is nice medium bodied, good carbonation. Finish is sweet malt, plums, dates, raisins, sweet spices, ending in a long nice sweet nutty aftertaste. Overall a nicely balanced and drinkable brew.

1," Dark brown beer with big frothy head good fruity and yeasty aroma, but I was a bit underwhelmed by the taste. I drank this shortly after dessert and a handful of maltesers and feel that they may have played a part in my being none too impressed, I will try again but for now it gets a lower than expected mark.

1," Pour is a dark brown with a tan head.  Aroma is not so much.  Some malts show up but i trying really hard.  Flavor is a little better with some chocolate malts but again not much else.  Finish is watery and boring.
"
1," DEC 24, 2005 (rerate - 12-24-05) Very nice classic dubbel appearance.  Yeasty, spicey aroma.  Bubblegum. Flavor mirrors the aroma with yeast, bubblegum, spice.  Fruit sneaks in at the end.  Plenty of carbonation. (7,4,8,3,16)		(original rating I gave it a 7,4,8,4,17)
"
1,"  Hazy amber brown color w/a  lasting off white head.  Yeasty, vinous raisin ester, and a little earthy/musty.  Fresh baked bready malt, hints of alcohol, and an every so slight hint of roast with some bakers chocolate & diacetyl.  Well balanced, but is lightly to bitter.  Some roast comes through a little stronger than I remember it in this one and is almost coffee like.  Dry flavor overall in the finish with some herbal hop flavors as well that linger into the aftertaste.  Toasted matl comes through after the roastiness up front.  Very little fruitiness as I also remember it having more.  Highly carbonated, medium body, and lightly astringent.  Alcohol is only lightly noticeable in the mouth.  Overall, I a little disappointed with this beer, or at least this bottle.  I seem to remember it being a little more complex.  Fruity esters are low in the flavor and it seems to be a little over hopped for my taste.
"
1," IMO more fullnes than the ""white"" one,tastes of fruit and yeast,hard to tell though,had it in a ""Chimay"" cupglas and as useally here in sweden they serve it too cold
"
1," 2007 version. Probably poured too cold, so had to let it warm up a touch before tasting. Pours a muddy reddish brown with a small lacing off white head. Fruity aroma with plenty of plums and raisins. Complex flavour, but never too powerful - just well-balanced. Dark, dried fruits and a berry-like sweetness to it. The alcohol is stunningly well hidden.
"
1," NOV 4, 2007 1pt., 9oz. bottle. Pours a dark cloudy unfiltered brown with a tan head that disappears somewhat too quickly. Aroma is light and complex with caramel, cinnamon, root-beer, oranges and yeast. Flavor is nutty with almonds and walnuts in the forefront; anise, oranges, yeast in the middle; and definitely some (light) alcohol bringing up the rear. Mouthfeel is full, creamy and smooth. Hops are well balanced and not particularly noticeable. Finish is long and satisfying. An Ale for the Ages.
"
1," My first trip to belgium, and this is one of the beers I sampled. It was excellent. For its alcohol content it tasted quite weak, but still good. Excellent finish.

1," very average, maybe my expectaitions were too high.

1," Bottle. Burgundy with thin off-white head. Hoppy with a sweetish malt nose. Some old fruit there. Malty taste and easy to drink, slightly bitter, winter fruit. Slightly watery, but with hints of spice. Alcohol in the palate, quite fruity though.
"
1," APR 24, 2007 Pint on tap at the Seven Bridges Brewpub in Jacksonville.  This was not as good as the stout or the IPA, but still a decent and drinkable brew.  Brown pour and creamy head, with a mild sweet aroma.  Flavors of chocolate and sweet malt.  Slightly nutty, and crisp with carbonation.  Also sampled on cask, but I  actually preferred the regular version
"
1," light malty aroma with a hint o' skunk, pale gold with minimal head, light corny malt with faint hop notes
"
1," Bottle. Accompanied by some spice Thai noodles. Cloudy pale yellow with a nice thin soft white skiff. Kind of cool toasted coconut scent. Soft dusty wheat flavour. Noticeable yeast. Coconut is there in the back half. Interesting as an experiment but not for all brewers to make one. Not sure I get the toasted note but if I imagine I can pick up something.
"
1," subtle yet very appealing aroma. Very deep, dark/red amber color. Nice foamy off white head. Very light and smooth yet bold taste. Not filling at all and satisfying aftertaste.
"
1," On tap at Chattanooga. Pours quite red with a good white head. The aroma is very woody with bicuity notes and something like damp basement. There is a surprising level of European hop bite in the flavor. Its very woody with a pleasing dry finish. Hints of apples and bread are noted. This is a very crisp, clean beer. This delivers in the way Id hope a typical lager to. Its not bad at all.
"
1," Bottled. Golden, with a white head. Light fruity sweetness in the nose. Flavor is quite weak, malt dominated with some grassyness. Medium body. Nice, but a bit too weak in the flavor and aroma. (060422)

A wonderfully made beverage, perfect to share with friends.
"
1," Ice Pick Ale 12 oz bought in Denver and opened in San Diego into pint glass.  Looks super clear and amber.  Smell like amber malts with hardly any hops and a bit of a wheaty yeast.

Still pretty good drinkability though.  overall 5 of 10.

1," Bottle. 08 Vintage. Pours very dark mahongany. Quite hazy out of the bottle with plenty of yeast sediment. Small rocky slightly off white head fades slowly leaving some lacing. Huge doughy yeast aromas when first poured. As the beer warms slightly this fades leaving plenty of dark fruit, caramel, toffee and some spice and alcohol. Very complex. Flavours show more of the same with dark fruit dominating supported by toffee and plenty of spice. ome alcohol on the finish. Mouthfeel is slightly thin but seems to suit this beer. Overall still a classic.

Flavor is everything I loved about Hopula, but with too much booze. Some nice vanilla notes, but bourbon constantly overpowers the Hopula. Just not my style, but would be very interesting if they reused the barrels.

"
1,"  Coppery ruby. Broken, loose-bubbled light tan head. Bourbon, peach, and earthy peat aroma. Hints of toffee malt, medicine, fig, and candied apples. Lifeless, watery body. Devoid of carbonation. Bland mixture of sweet malts doused with medicine. Faint whiskey tannins firm up the body, but render the medicinal sweetness intolerable.  Ends astringently and medicinal with powdery pale malt whispers. Peachy esters linger alongside tight earthy hop bitterness. This is on the right path, but they really need to learn how to serve Real Ale.
"
1," Bomber. Dark amber, moderate head. Aroma is certainly bland, of stale cardboard malts and supermarket gingerbread. The spices are not expressed well, and are barely there at all. A thin stream of generic cakey malts and light, low-grade brown sugar are the only things I taste here. Dreadfully boring.

1," A golden ale with a thin creamy lacing white head. A pleasant aroma of fruity esters, orange peels, and light lemon. In mouth, a good candy sugar with bubble gum sweetness, warming alcohol, orange peels. Medium bodied. On tap at brewpub Dec. 30 2008.

1," On tap at the brewpub. Served with a spoonful of blueberries in the beer. A good thing they add those, because you would never know it was a fruit beer otherwise.

1," (20oz bottle) Viscous beige head with an opaque body. Nose of alcohol, vanilla, chocolate and red wine. Strong initial alcohol flavour with a roasted nut and cocoa powder palate. Not terribly sweet; very mellow and relaxing. Very good. Thanks to Lubiere for giving me my first new beer in a month!!!
"
1," Seven Bridges Sweet Magnolia Brown. The aroma has the basic malt and not elements you expect from the style with the hops taking a back seat. What was not good about it was the very weak nature of the aroma. The appearance is brown with a small head. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is thin. This is another one where I was not impressed but its not bad.
"
1," This beer is really very good.  I was much more impressed with this than the Chimay White.  It had a great aroma, sweet, dark fruity, malty, and maybe a bit of yeasty bread, but not overwhelmingly so.  It tasted malty and of dark fruits.  A very tasty beverage indeed.
"
1," Bottle. Mostly clear / slightly hazy amber pour. Nice fluffy white head that dissipates rather quickly. Pine resin nose with a touch of citrus. Taste is pine, citrus, and some earthy elements. Quite hoppy - and Id say a touch unbalanced.
"
1," The aroma is bourbon, vanilla, chocolate and booze with some sweet malt and molasses notes. Black body with a thin mocha head. Decent flavor with roast malt, vanilla, bourbon and some burnt bitter and sweet chocolate notes.
"
1," OCT 22, 2006 11.2oz bottle, no date.  Pours a hazy reddish brown with a large light beige head into my Chimay glass.  Aroma of dusty raisins, brown sugar, slightly herbal--the aroma isnt very strong, and I cant blame the temperature because this has been sitting out for quite a while.  The taste isnt strong, either.What is there is a very creamy, very soft carbonated  beer with slight bitterness.  Dusty raisins again, some herbal notes and a little bit of spicy hops.There is also some brown sugar.  Kinda nice in that the flavor doesnt kick you in the face--everything is subtle about this beer.		During my rerate, the flavors seem more apparent, even though it is a bit colder.  I think my only change is bumping overall from 16 to 17.
"
1," I tried this at the Oregon Spring Brew Fest, or whatever it was called, with my wife in tow. She doesn't like beer, usually, but since we rarely see each other she went with me to the event and actually tasted many of the beers I sampled. This one she actually liked. So I bought a bottle knowing she was coming down for the weekend and thought she might want to have some. Well, she had a sip but still didn't want to drink a beer. < sigh > Oh well, I tried.		I really don't have a ton of experience with Belgians, in full disclosure, but *damn* this is good. It's very close to the Trois Pistole (sp?) from Unibrou, but I prefer this one.		Oh, I'm not using the ""correct"" glass for the beer yet again.		Pours a rather dark brown with a suprisingly white head and very little lacing. The first pour I was cautious because of the many overflows I've had with Belgians, and that left very little head. The second pour I was more vigerous, but still not too much head or any lacing.		Smells very fruity, as in raisins, apples. The scent is inviting.		Taste surely doesn't let you down. The fruits I mentioned are there as well as a few others like banana. It's spicy as well; cloves are present.		Mouthfeel is full and spicy. Drinkability suffers only from the high alcohol content, but I'll definately have more of these.		This is complex. I want to grab a few more of these while they're still on sale and put them away for awhile, so maybe I'll be able to revisit it in a year or so. However, you definately owe it to yourself to try this beer.

1," Cask at the GBBF. Golden with a lasting white head. Grainy and grassy aroma with a phenolic touch. Dry, grassy and bitter flavour.
"
1," From the bottle, pours a hazy dark reddish with a thick bubbly off-white head. Not much in the nose. Taste is thin, some berries, kinda watery. A bit of yeast, finishes clean. Its ok, but I dont think its as good as its bretheren.
"
1," Very, Very nice beer......almost seemed ""Snobish"".....Poured a cloudy somewhat brownish color with nice head retention.....Aroma was nice....floral, dark grain smell.....Flavor was very interesting....slight alcohole spice that was well blended with a nice malty sensation and a slight yeasty fruity sensation.....Naturally carbonated.....nice mouth feel......Just a great beer all together......

1," ok beer I prefer beers with less  sugar, now I tasted the Caulier, I cant stop!!
"
1," Had on tap at the Chattanooga location. Dark golden appearance, good sized head. Sweet, malty aroma. Has a slight nutty taste to it.  Very smooth mouthfeel, quite pleasant to say the least. Above average for a brewpub lager.
"
1," very mediocre.  lacking the butterscotch essence promised by the label.  i don't think the scotch would be too fond of naming this beer after them...
"
1," It had a darkish brown body with desecnt tan head that doesnt last for too long.  It was a delight to drink.
"
1," fruits, malt, bronze color, fizzy, medium body, 	Bottled. Little bit different of the blue one. More fruits, more sugar. Easier but a bit less complex. But whatever, a very good beer.
"
1," Lietchies nose, a bit sulphury. Rocky fizzy head on a red orange brew with fizzy carbonation. Pricks and numbs the tongue, spicey  and fruity - grapes and pepper. Very fizzy but very nice.
"
1," Draught at Beachside Restaurant on Marina Dr., West VancouverBrown color. Light nutty aroma (and also detergent, but this is the fault of the pipes at Beachside restaurant on Marina Drive). Weak body, light caramel and nutty flavor, dry. Correct bitterness. Simple, but its balanced, and pleasant.
"
1," One of my favorite Belgian Strongs.  Aroma is malty and delicious... smells of doughy bread.	Appearance is a crimson brown that is crystal clear with a nice head that leaves good lacing.	Taste and palate is smooth and creamy, malty and delcious. Slightly bitter but mostly sweet through the finish that stays with you but is not overly long. A wonderful Trappist Beer!
"
1," Draught at Sailor HagarsThe aroma is light, it reminds me some cider. Dry mouthfeel, malt and caramel flavor, maybe with a light trace of honey at the end; strong bitterness. Simple.

"
1," Bottle.  Dark cola color with a fluffy & bubbly light tan head with some fizz.  Slight alcohol aroma, with yeast & malt notes with a slight fruit smell.  Clean and balanced, soft & fast beginning that leads to a rich flavord middle with allot of pop, spice, and lite fruit tastes; sharp and clean that ends with an almost dry aftertaste with an alcohol flavor.  Lots of flavor, robust.
"
1," A delicious Trapist dark Belgian Strong with aged soft cheese and Belgian yeast permeating through the nose, while balancing with a fresh floral aroma.  Thick off white head and dark body contrast nicely, flavor is earthy and rich.  light tobacco, balanced with sweet cheese and stone fruit and playful carbonation.  This is an expertly crafted beer.
"
1," Reddish brown color. The complex aroma is in some ways similar to a hefeweizen with the addition of the dried fruit  and spicy flavor.  On the carbonated side, but it helps balance the sweetness.  Fantastic beer.
"
1," 330ml bottle sample in a small cafe not far from the brewery itself. Pours darkish brown, not too dark though. Head is a nice tan with some nice lacing as well.  Smells of dried fruit and bread as well. Taste is of raisin, prune, dates and the like. There is also a tasted of alcohol and spice. Really quite a delicious brew. I would like to start aging a few of these beauties at home.

1," Pours dark tan, small head, earthen, limestone aroma, that comes of sharp. Slightly bitter, wooden, metallic, yeasty flavor. A  bit rough on the finish.
"
1," A good amber coloured full head beer. A hoppy but not overpowering taste with a full caramel flavor.
"
1," Bottle. Pours a dark, dark reddish-brown with a quickly diminishing tan head that yields an attractively sweet and spicy yeast aroma. The taste backs up the appearance nicely. Its a complex net of yeast and malts that is fruity and caramelly at the same time. Very pleasant to drink.
"
1," pint at brewery - Aroma is mild wheat and malt.  Pours transparent yellow with no head or lacing.  Flavor is very mild wheat.  Palate is clean.  One dimensional wheat flavored water.
"
1," In my opinion, the red is much better.  This just has too much alcohol.  Or to put it more accurately, there is too much alcohol that is noticable.  Dry like the red.  Kind of a yeasty smell and murky color.  Head that lasts.  Spicy and peppery.  Its OK, just too strong.
"
1," Served in the new goblet..dark murky mahogany big brown colour, better than average lacing, good puddle of constent head foam....banannas -fruit -roastiness -bitter off fruit -leather =aromas.... alchol is masked completely...delicously nice+mellow yet fiercly magical brew..

1," On tap at the Chattanooga location. Has a dark golden appearance, slight head. Citrusy nose. Flavor has some muted citrus notes as well, with a good even bitterness. Not tongue numbing bitter, just pleasant. Even mouthfeel.
"
1," Small bottle. Dark brown with a white head. Candi sugar and malty nose. Taste is very sweet but toned down by the voluminous maltiness and richness. Very easy to drink. Alcohol is all but hidden.

1," DEC 2, 2009 ** 6-27-04, ok, I had to visit this rating again.  Yes, the experience wasnt good, but the flavor wasnt horrible.  It just wasnt as good as it shouldve been.  Still disappointed.**  	****Forced to endure this swill again at a birthday party.  Is it possible its gotten worse?...alas tis true, what a joke this beer has become. ****recent price hike has me rating this lower....poor value, basically a huge sham.****		May 2005 rating...it just gets worse.		Oh how the mighty have fallen.  Disappointed is the best word to use here.  Tim Webb reported the demise of this once fine ale in his beer guide last year, but I wasnt convinced till this taste.  To look at it youd never know things had gone so bad.  Taking a taste removes all doubt.  I think Mr. Webbs quote ""...overtones of damp cardboard..."" says it all.  What complexity that was there before is all but gone.  I lived in The Netherlands for three years and grew to love this jewel.  All I can say is that the bottled stuff available in the US now is NOT worth the money---not even close.  I remember this used to compare very well with Rochefort 10 and Westvleteren Abt.  Those fine brews blow this one to smithereens.  Im sure its no coincidence that Chimays demise occurred just after they were bought out.  I love Belgian ales, but you should stay clear of this one until they figure out how to get their old swagger back.		A friend offered this up tonight.....it stinks just as bad in 2009.  It actually might be worse.....simply awful.....the brewery thats belching this crap out needs to be hit by a few Tomahawk missiles.......blow it to oblivion.
"
1," slightly sweet and yeasty, moderately wheaty nose with cacao and shy fruity notes of prunes. Light-sweet and sourish flavour, rather slim bodied with a lively carbonation. Dark malt-character with cacao and fruity elements; the latter becoming stronger towards the sweet and sourish finish. Average dark wheat (24.07.08).
"
1," 8 May 2004 - Light malt aroma. Clear dark brown. Flavour has a slight bitterness with smooth rounded stone fruit and mocha roast malt notes. Fizzy medium mouthfeel.
"
1," This is definitely a fine beer. Like all Trappists it looks wonderful in its correct glass. Spicy and dry, with some complexity, a little chocolate, a little fruitiness. Unfortunately however, I will always find it hard not to view this as Chimay Bleus less interesting brother.
"
1," 33 cl bottle. Pours a nice dark mahogany color with a very thin white head that dissipates quickly. The aroma is delicate with dried fruits, yeast, and malty sweetness. The flavor is similar to the nose, with the fruit flavors and a caramel sweetness being the most prominent flavors.

1," Cloudy orange, foamy, dense head. Cirtusy, grapefruit-like aroma. Very crisp palate at first, then some piney, resiny notes. Crisp finish. Nice session beer.

1," Bottle from Sainsburys. Sour grassy fruity aroma. Cloudy medium brown colour with a good head. Strong sour fizzy fruity malt flavour. Flat & watery. Not nice.

1," I was impressed with this stout...though it is a bit thin, it has a wonderful aroma and taste of fresh coffee that I believe distinguishes itself from other run-of-the-mill stouts.  I definitely want more of this!
"
1," 330ml Bottle at Home 15/05/2010	Fruit and malt aromas. Carbonation. Small white head. Amber coloured strong in alcohol and a little sweet on the palate with a candy sugar flavour. A little dryness in a lasting malt finish.

1," My fav of the chimay family. Very dark amber pour. Aroma of fruit (cherries and dates i guess) very sweet beer. One of my favs
"
1," 5/1/11. 12oz bottle courtesy Cavie! Hazy orange pour with a small off-white head that fades to a ring fast. Light aroma of caramel and a hint of sour corn. Smooth, malty flavor that lingers sour a bit as well. Interesting, not bad.
"
1," Looked and smelled promising.  Picture perfect stout appearance (though the head deflated rapidly), and the aroma was spot on chocolately coffee.  The palate was watery and not creamy at all.  I would even say slightly gritty.  The taste of the beer left the most to be desired.  It was a shadow of its aroma mostly tasting like burnt coffee with the slightest sweetness and chocolate.  In the end, better than Guiness, but not by much
"
1," Bottle. Pours dark brown with some off-white head. Quite alcoholic and thinner, for lack of a better work, than some comparable brews. This is not necessarily bad. I liked it and will have it again.
"
1," This draft brew from the brewery poured a small sized head of foamy fine to medium sized off-white colored bubbles that were mostly diminishing and left behind a transparent softly carbonated light orange brown colored body. The deep aroma was hoppy. The thin mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish hoppy aftertaste. The thin off the mark  flavor contained notes of hops. Not one that I would likely buy again.
"
1," Could I join a monestary and spend the rest of my life brewing this beautiful nectar? OMG! Fantastic red color. Puffy, mousse-like head that clings to the glass. A little cloudy. Fruit, malts, excellent balance, smooth, nice finish.
"
1," Draught @ WestParkBrau, Am WestPark 6, Ingolstadt, Bavaria, Germany 85057.Unclear medium to dark amber brown color with a average, frothy, good lacing, mostly lasting, off-white to beige head. Aroma is moderate malty, roasted, chocolate malt. Flavor is moderate to light light heavy sweet and moderate bitter with a average to long duration, old malt, chocolate malt. Body is medium, texture is oily, carbonation is soft. [20101001]
"
1," Bottle, 5.2%. Mild yeasty and spicy aroma. A little spicy aroma hop. Cloudy yellow colour. Small stable white head. The flavour is quite bitter for the style. OK spiciness, clove and spicy hops. Rough hop finish. But refreshing.
"
1," Bottle. Pours a dark chestnut brown with a light red hue and a nice beige head that is long lasting. Aroma of sweet malt, dark ripe fruits, toffee and yeast. Flavours of sweet malt, plums, raisins, spice and alcohol flavours. Very complex aroma and flavours. The alcohol is well hidden and gives a warming mouthfeel. There is a slight bitterness in the finish. This is a fine Trappist.
"
1," Brown cloudy hue with white foamy head, no lacing, smell sweet prunes and yeast taste mostly belgian yeast, some leather, bubbles dissipate into a lightly tart finish, complexity as warms moved to smoothness and alcohol
"
1," Pourred a copperish brew with a nice big head. The head stayed on top for a long time. Very complex spice with a not too distinct alcohol taste. I would describe the taste as sweet with a light bitterness aftertaste. Very firm body. This is classic and can never get enough of this.
"
1," Great tasting and remarkably smooth drinking beer.  Does a good job of masking the alcohol.  Large bubbly head.
"
1," Of course it is a good Belgian Strong Ale, but for the price you pay you can find the same quality for cheaper in some other beers. I for one dont think Chimay is worth all the praise it gets. Its not the best thing to come out of belgium.
"
1," Pours a deep brown hue that is close to opaque with a fading frothy tan head and the remaining ring left good lace upon the glass. The aroma has notes of chocolate, smoked, nutty malts, oatmeal, prune, coffee, and some grassy hops. The flavor profile is sweet mocha,  toasted grain, walnut, with a light background of acidic fruit and some mild bitterness. The aftertaste does display a bit more hop and coffee bitterness but not much. The mouth feel is medium bodied, slightly oily and carbonated just right matching the flavors. Well not huge or earth shattering, a solid Oatmeal Stout and quite drinkable. Worth another try, could be really good if found on hand pump.
"
1," Malt and corn nose that is also the light taste. Rocky head - nearly fizzy, amber brown color. Metallic finish.
"
1," Bottle.33cl. Pours a vary dark amber brown Colour with yeast in the glass. Nice big head which kinda lingers. Highly carbonated and yeasty which greatly contributes to the overall enjoyment of the beverage.
"
1," [Bottle] Dark amber pour with about a half inch of white foam on top. Citrus and pine hop aroma is actually pretty subdued. Typical grapefruit, orange zest and astringent grassy hops in the taste. The malt profile is there, but mainly bready and weak. Average carbonation levels. An easy drinker, but very run-of-the-mill.
"
1," Small pour from a bottle at a friends during a midwest IPA tasting. Citrus aroma and tastes of mild orange, decent malt profile.
"
1," GCBF. Poured to a nice clear walnut brown colour, with a slightly off white head. Loose head that collapsed quickly. Very mild smelling with low hopping. Tastes low alcohol. A very mild smooth beer with the requisite nutty biscuity malt flavours. Enjoyable. A nice mild beer from a company that seems to excel at unoffensive mildness. Yum.
"
1," Pours a clear gold.  Aroma is malty with a slight hint of pine and citrus.  Taste is quite light and malty.  Overall a nice lager.
"
1," Dark copper, off white cover.  Aroma is corny, a bit of tin, caramel sweetness.  The taste is sweeter, candy, caramel, light malt husks, a bit of corn.
"
1," A dark beer. Lots of chocolate and dark fruit flavors. A little bit of spice. Complex but very easy to drink so if you slam this beer you might miss out on a lot of the different flavors.
"
1," Best beer I have ever had...I am no professional but this is really some good stuff
"
1," When I hear its a Belgium beer, I think of Wheaties cereal.  I am not a fan of the cereal beers. This was not the case. I enjoyed this beer.
"
1," Draft in Jacksonville where the beer is 4.13% not the 5.16% listed here.	<P>	The aroma is sweet toasted malts, bread and nuts. The body is a ruddy brown and holds a lasting tan head. Roasted malt, alcohol brushed nuts, lightly sweet fruit notes. Decent brown ale.
"
1," OCT 15, 2007 To me Chimay, as a brand name, represents the distinctly European sophistication and erudition that was somehow lost when those early continentals floated across the Atlantic to our fledgling nation.  Not that America doesnt have its fair share of scholars and appreciable achievements in the sciences (social science too), but we never see any Henry Higgins wandering the streets carousing with locals and berating their ignorance.  Somehow the tweed jacket seems forced, with pipes replaced by cigarettes and tea by coffee.  The Chimay Red is a drinkable vestige of this Old World cognoscenti, passionate and assertive, yet refined and reserved.  Its colored like a well-used redwood mantle piece cast in slivered sunlight, blanketed in dust, and crowned with a thick, spongy, heavy cream colored head.  Aged, odiferous cheese is the mainstay of the aroma, conjuring images of cheese served on ornate silver platters, smooth, salty but also pungent.  The distinctive smell of yeast adds to the fermentation theme, inciting a hunger for some bread, while a white grape note rounds out the savory flavors with a traditional and classic, wine-like character.  The Chimay Reds taste is abound with similar tried and true flavors, emanating a feel of traditional French cooking.  Before I notice any specific ingredients, however, Im struck by the smooth and creamy texture of the Red.  It is frothy and soft  a gratifying mouth feel, perfect for indoors or temperate weather drinking.  The flavors catch me by surprise as I relish in the palate, introducing themselves with solid doses of banana fosters, heavy cream, sweet orange liqueur and a generous proportion of alcohol.  Its warming to the touch, and a textural experience unlike any other.  The strong-willed flavors, especially the alcohol, make the Chimay Red a bold beverage, capable of holding its own even in the strongest culinary bouts, making it an ideal pairing for some heavier meals.  Root vegetable based stews, soups, pork roast and maybe even tender beef dishes, like a medium cooked Beef Wellington would all do well to meet the Chimay Red on equal terms on the tongue.  It is satisfying, fancy and assertive, and every bit a beer that gives me the feeling Im enjoying it in an intellectual parlor somewhere in a charming, urban European setting on a cool spring evening, although it would be of appreciable service in almost any environ.
"
1," Cloudy, golden coloured, mid-sized stable white head; yeast, cloves and bananas in the nose; moderate sweetish and almost a bit bitter flavour, light bodied; fruity, a bit citrousy and yeasty finish. A rather pleasant Weizen...
"
1," Small head that disappeared quickly. Light Spiced nose with nutmeg aroma. Clear light brown in colour. Strong spicy taste with nutmeg and malt profiles.
"
1," I appreciate the attempt at a style that is not brewed enough in the new world--or old, for that matter. Not an exceptional example of a Vienna lager, the Hagars/Howe Sound version is nevertheless solid and refreshing and worth a try.
"
1," Had all three of these werneckers at a little festival in orbendorf (hope Im spelling that right). This smells fine. The first flavor is of beer, but then the sprite soda flavor dominates the end. seems very much like a soda. Good, but why drag down their excellent pils by adding anything?
"
1," Tasted on tap at brewpub. This stout pours a deep black color. Medium sized tan foamy head. Aroma is chocolate and coffee. A medium bodied stout. Malts are roasted malts, chocolate and coffee. Hops are earthy. Smooth taste. Nice balance. Easy drinking stout. Touch of wood and some vanilla. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.
"
1," Pours red/brown with a big foaming white head. Nose is yeast, red wine, malt, dried fruit (apricot, pineapple etc) and perfumey floral notes. Taste is tropical dried fruit, brown sugar and creaminess. Really nice and thoroughly well balanced Belgian beer.
"
1," 12 oz. bottle from grownfool- thanks again, Brian! Pours a cloudy orange-amber color with a pretty small white head. Aroma of sweet malts, citrusy hops, biscuits, crackers, cereal, and sugar. Flavor of minerals, pale malts, straw, paper, and saltines. Light-bodied, with high carbonation and a crisp, mineral mouthfeel. Dry finish. Promising in the nose but there just isnt much flavor here.
"
1," Poured the color of a deeply steeped tea, with the fizzy, snap-crackle-pop of a cherry soda.  Very artistically subtle aroma of yeast and malt.  Fizzy to the palate, not unlike a cola, with a quiet well balanced flavor of tea, cherry, malt, yeast, pear ... Very enjoyable.
"
1," From a 750 ml. Pours a deep brownish red color with a thick and lasting white head. The nose is distinctly yeasty. The flavor is also dominated by the yeast with some hints of raisin. Although I find this beer enjoyable, this is not a spectacular trappist beer. I think this is slightly overrated.
"
1," DEC 24, 2009 Cork has 01/09 printed on it. Im guessing thats the bottling date. 		Beautiful transparent rosewood color. Classic Belgian nose with an understated bouquet of fruit and maltiness. The palate is suave and sophisticated. Perfect sensation, great flavor and a gentle finish. 		Enjoyable, but lacking in aroma and flavor right now. Better with age, I am guessing.
"
1," Draft sampler at BRB. Hazy amber color with a moderate white head that diminished slowly. Medium fruit and wheat aroma. Light to medium body with smooth texture. Moderate wheat flavor with a medium sweet finish. Average wheat brew, just not my style.
"
1," On tap at Big River  WDW.  Poured medium brown with a short, creamy cap of tan head.  The aroma picked up bakers chocolate and molasses upfront with lots of roast to it.. rather muddled.  The flavor had black malts, chocolate, and dry-roasted coffee at the core with coffee and almost oaky bitterness around.. warmth brought out sticky molasses that worked quite well.. dry finish.  Medium-bodied and nicely roasty on the palate.. didnt move too well through the mouth though.
"
1," Bottle 50 cl. Courtesy of fonefan. Pours yellow with a slight haze and a small white head. Very lemony aroma - fresh. Light body, very dry and tart lemon accents. Dry finish. A good Radley without the cloying sweetness. 171010
"
1," Complex brew with masteful balance between the hops, malt and yeast. Initial intensity melows into a long rich rewarding finish. As with any ale; if you drink it too cold you will wonder where all the flavour and aroma have gone.
"
1," Bottle. Pours a cloudy dark copper with a medium off-white head. Sweet aromas of caramel and fruit. A light taste made up of sugar, nuts, and light fruit. Just a hint of alcohol. Rich, smooth texture.
"
1," 650ml bottle from BC Liquor in West Van. Pours a straw yellow with thin white head. Aroma is potently hoppy with citrus and lemony notes along with cereal malt. Taste is similar but the extremes are more pronounced. The hops are bitingly bitter. Some citrus there, grapefruit predominantly. Malt is very cereal, bready. The two seem to work in opposition rather than in partnership. Finish is still very bitter and pointed at the end of the tongue. Its decent but not mind blowing.
"
1," Dark brown color with strong malt flavor and sweetness. Very good overall.
"
1," Beautiful dark brown with a voluminous head that lasted fairly well, reducing to frothy medium sized bubbles.  Not nearly as aromatic as it seems it should be.  But the aroma is spicy and a little yeasty.  Very complex flavor aspects.  Spicy... just on the swwet side.  THere is a pleasent bitterness in the finish.  The carbonation is almost champagne like and the mouthfeel silky.  It is certainly not a beer that I would refuse often.  Of course the high alchohol makes it a beer that I can't drink lots of. ;)
"
1," Good but I felt that it was fighting (and winning) a battle against the alcohol.  It seemed like a conscious attempt at masking.  Still - spicy, piquant and full of flavor
"
1," Draft sampler at BRB. Dark amber hue with a moderate with head that diminished slowly. Moderate hoppy aroma. Medium body with a dry texture. Moderate hoppy flavor  with medium dry bitter finish.
"
1," Looks like a flat coke ... and kinda tastes like one too.  Dirty sock aroma.  Bit of a sour tone, like sweet malt soda.  No thanks.
"
1," Fair bit of head (about half a fingers width), that stayed consistent throughout. Taste was not at all bitter, could taste a little bit of alcohol, but not overpowering. Kinda expensive, probably too expensive for how good it is, but it was overall a very tasty beer.
"
1," DEC 6, 2009 From a big bottle. Pours a nice beige head, which stays on the beer for a very long time. Spicy taste with a nice almost-sweet aroma.

1," Bottle. Deep golden color. Malty, flowery aroma with a hint of tropical fruit. Malty sweet, slightly alcoholic flavor with peach and pineapple. Flowery hops. Medium bodied. Hint of butter in the aftertaste. Quite nice.
"
1," FEB 13, 2005 Dark redbrown with firm but thin beige head. 	Fresh aroma with notes of cloves, cardboard, almonds, cherry pits, chocolate, apricots and spices. A bit hoppy.	Round flavour with notes of chocolate, almonds and  apples
"
1," This is one of my top five beers. The caramel taste is wonderful and the streght of alcohol taste is, at my opinion, simply perfect.
"
1," SEP 5, 2005 Quite possibly the best beer in the world. I absolutely love the Blue on a special occasion, but this ale has no peers in terms of balance and drinkability, being simultaneously estery, malty, slightly hoppy, with a perceived alcohol, yet eerily drinkable. A truly sublime drinking experience in a Chimay goblet with good company. It gets no better.
"
1," Not quite up to the standard of the blue and the white, but still very enjoyable, not too malty for a dubbel, thank god, there is nothing worsen than a dubbel ruined because nits too malty. Very enjoyable.
"
1," 33cl bottle from the Doerak, Delft.	Amber colour, decent head.  I much prefer the Chimay Blue.  Its more complex
"
1," Poured a hazy, amber color with a nice tan head and little lacing.  The aroma and flavor had a hint of spices along with a slight hint of raisins.  The beer has a medium body, creamy texture, average carbonation, and an abrupt finish.  Overall, I liked this beer.  I dont run across it often, but I would drink it again.
"
1," Pours cognac-colored with a nice white head.  Aroma is of citrus (oranges mostly).  Taste is bitter with a nice maltiness in the finish.  Not a great IPA by style, but not bad either.  Just very simple.
"
1," Bottle thanks to thirdeye11. Pours with a clear golden body with a fading white head. Aroma of orange and herbal hops. Some caramel as well. Taste is orange, tangerine and caramel. Dry and fizzy.
"
1," Dark and bubbly.  Sweet aroma.  Extremely drinkable, as the alcohol content is masked by fine flavor.   Malty and sweet.  Drink slowly and enjoy!  Youd better drink slowly at the price per ounce!!
"
1," Dark brown pour with a moderate white head that quickly recedes.  Smells of fruit and honey.  Little hint of an aftertaste.  This beer certainly does a good job of hiding the 9% ABV.

1," Pours brown with an off-white head. Aroma has hints of floral hops and nuts. Medium body flavor is sweet and malty with a dry hop finish. Good!
"
1," Bottled@Monks Caf Wallingatan, Stockholm. Deep golden colour with a mediumsized off-white head. Aroma is citrus fruits, mild tropical fruits as well as some crisp bready and sweet maltyness. Flavour is fruity, floral and rather malty with a crispy bite. tonguetickling carbonation. Balanced and quite nice not too sweet IPA.
"
1," 330ml bottle. Deep brown with red low-lights. Strong, slightly off-white head which proved long lasting. Aroma was sweet with some spice notes. Plenty of malt and dried fruit flavours, with vinous, almost port-like finish. The best Chimay beer.
"
1," 12 oz bottle shared with padrefan.  Very chocolate and roasty malts on the aromas.  Nice dark pour with a decent head.  I should have just smelled this one all day.  The flavor fell off a bit with some metallicness and a sour twang that didnt seem to fit in.
"
1," I starting to really enjoy Belgian Trappist beers and this is an archetype of good taste and quality in the tradition
"
1," Its a great beer, smooth, medium bodied, silky finish. This was a nice treat.
"
1," 50 cL bottle. Pours clear and golden yellow with a small white head. Dry hoppy to grassy aroma. Mild sweetend caramel malt flavoured with a mild grassy and bitter hops flavour mixed into this. Ends medium dry.
"
1," Hand-pump at Sailor HagarsHazy dark amber color; creamy head. The aroma is light, but there is a good caramel flavor, quite sweet, with respectable bitterness. Not fully British, but quite good.
"
1," Tap.  Wheat aroma with banana and citrus hop notes, a little bit of cloves.  Pours cloudy yellow with a thin white head that hangs out around the rim; lined lacing.  Hoppy wheat flavor with a citrus rind finish.  Fizzy and crisp light bodied palate.
"
1," Ah that lovely site of a Chimay Bleu, breathing away in my Chimay Chalice, deep opalescent garnet to brown in color, the head majestic in its presence, the lace perfectly clinging to glass. What a nose, would make Jimmy Durante proud, large in malt, sweet, hints of caramel and yes, maybe yeast, down right sniffable. Begins malt sweet, the top middling in feel, the finish beautifully hopped, majestically carbonated and the aftertaste as dry as the Arizona Desert. I know many think this beer overrated, well Bucko, I like it, and it is my Most favorite Chimay! Ranks #66 on my current 1000 beer master list.
"
1," On cask at BI - Aroma of the Hopula Play-Doh hops and malt with lots of oak, vanilla and bourbon.  Pours dark mahogany with a medium lasting head and great lacing.  Flavor is strong bourbon, too strong.  The base beer is hidden under there somewhere but is way overpowered.  I had trouble getting it down to be honest.
"
1," On tap at the brewery in Nashville. Black as night color. Aroma of dark roasted malts, burnt espresso. Taste is on the creamier side. Roastiness is a little acrid. Bitterness is firm and appropriate; well balanced. All around average stout.
"
1," Pours cloudy blonde colour with a huge white head. Lots of carbonation, semi-tart flavor, and light fruit. mouthfeel is very creamy and bubbly. Aromas of fresh hops, grapefruit and lemon. Taste is slightly bitter, but still very smooth.
"
1," Head dissipates.  Cloudy, which is not how I like my beer.  Apple cider.  Smells good from far away.  Smells really good, actually.  Beery but citrusy.  Not bad.  Taste is not bad exacly.  There's not much at first but after it sinks in it goes ""BLACH!""  Average nouthfeel.

1," pours with a beautiful beige head, and a deep brown/copper color. Sweet and a little syrupy but not unpleasantly so. Mild yeasty and spicy aroma. Goes wonderfully with cheeses (especially chimay cheese)
"
1," Sitting in a tree inhaling the intense smoke of a fruit-harboring wood cabin whose fire has just been extinguished by torrential rain...Very humid and woody smoke, impossible to escape from (I not necessarily trying to), with a garrulous fruitiness of junipers (real) and apricots (fictive)...Honey impersonations and earthy bitterness rising in the end...Perhaps smokier than a Schlenkerla, an incredibly memorable experience which I hope to relive again...Immense thanks Per!!...
"
1," I keep buyin other Belgian beers trying to find this or something similar, but it doesnt seem to exist so Ill just give up.   Had a great glass of this the other night after a long ride while sitting on the pavement outside a friends house.  It was a small slice of alcoholic heaven.  How does a 9% beer come off not tasting like rubbing alcohol? I dont know how they do it, but others need to figure it out.
"
1," Thick brown creamy head, dark amber body, aroma with strong fruity, a little metallic. Strong, smooth filling taste. One can feel the alcohol, but it is not obvious in the taste, which is very pleasant. It goes down well, making you want more!
"
1," Very drinkable.  Sweet, but not too sweet.  Good, strong taste that doesn't hang around too long.

1," Amber coloured. Medium bodied, well balanced with big bitterness. Flowery with citrus aroma
"
1," Nice coriander aroma with a spicy dry flavour.
"
1," On tap at Boardwalk in Disneyworld.  A nice, mildly hoppy ale.  Good balance between malt/hops.  A little thin mouthfeel, carbonation was very light.  	Good session beer.
"
1," 33 cl bottle.  poured amberish with a white head.  aroma was caramel malt, fruity notes, melon, and maybe some cinnamon.  flavor was grain and some spice followed by some bitterness.  body was medium with high carbonation.  was hoping to be better and glad i didnt pay for a full 750.
"
1," Tasted on tap at brewpub. Pours a medium orange color. Small sized white foamy head. Aroma is malty and sweet. A medium bodied mild. Malts are fruity and sweet. Hops are earthy and a touch floral. Nice balance. Light carbonation. Light and refreshing. Probably would make a good session ale. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.

1," MAY 18, 2004 The greatest of all time? There are times that I drink this beer and I can't believe that a mortal man created it. I guess that is why it comes from men of the cloth. The corked bottle is subtly better. I have had the pleasure of trying a 6 yr. old bottle and it was WONDERFUL. That experience convinced me to start my own 'cellar'---First Anniversary bottle"
1," Orange pour with creamy white head and lace. Large citrus, bread, and caramel malt aroma. Bready, citrus, with a flat medium bitter finish. Medium bodied and fizzy but a nice beer.
"
1," Bottle - Dark amber/brown nice creamy head. Fruity aroma. Malty, hoppy with some complex flavors such as toffee, hints of raisin, etc.  I thinking this would go better with food than the Blue.
"
1," Draught at Sailor HagarsGolden color, hazy. The aroma is light; there is light caramel flavor, quite dry, with a shade of toffee. Drinkable Ale, though the last thing I would associate it to is a Wit.

1," APR 12, 2008 Im getting the feeling that I dont really like dubbels. this one is borderline undrinkable for me. Not at all interesting.
"
1," FEB 24, 2011 Tart and fruity nose with a bit of cellar mustiness. Pours deep and cloudy coppery-red with a thick, lasting off-white head. Sparkling character dances on the tongue. Starts with a lightly sweet fruit winey flavor which mingles nicely with a bittering quality near the very dry finish. A hint of cherries in the aftertaste. Very quenching.
"
1," Bottle. Dark amber color with a thick off-white foam. Complex notes of spice, fruit and yeast. Full bodied with a sweet finish. Very little bitterness.
"
1," I like this beer.  Well balanced, bitter without a lingering bitter aftertaste.  Feels like a beer that will put hair on your chest.  Creamy head, like meringue.  Smells yeasty.  Palate is full bodied, smooth, slightly astringent.
"
1," Red ale with plenty of floating bodies. Light shines through slightly. The head is very white but diminishing. The smell is slightly citrusy. The taste is very smooth and slightly fruity. Not as bitter as some belgians and doesn't have a long aftertaste. Heavy carbonation tickles the throat, takes away from the flavor. Very enjoyable.
"
1," Not much of a nose. Light beige head. Lots of figs, dates, raisins. Dark fruit throughout. Nice carbonation profile.
"
1," Malty aroma with a nice full head.  Hoppy/fruity taste and nice, balanced finish.  This was a good clean beer.
"
1," Bubbly head. Looks like it would be a nutty brown. Smells like sweet baby puke.
"
1," Light nose, dark caramel-brown color, big foamy head. Light toasted malt taste that is a little buttery. Smooth round mouth feel initially turns to a crisp end. A little too thin, Id say.
"
1," Bottle@Home. Raisin, malts, toffee, fruity and light herbal aroma. Dark brown color, beige large head, good lace. Sweet, very malty, bitter, chocolate, butterscotch, laurel. Feels more alcoholic than the 6.5% ABV mentioned on the bottle, very warming.
"
1," Appearance like a coke with very nice head, many fizz bubbles. Very carbonated, somewhat filling due to the carbonation. 9% ABV, and I can defiantly taste it. Great choice, I will be drinking more of this.
"
1," Deep brown pour with tan head and lace. A dark brown sugar and toasted malt aroma. A toasted malt and hints of dried fruit. A bit thin and watery. Not much above average but very drinkable.
"
1," Highly carbonated when pouring, large head. Once it settles it is less gassy. Has a great aroma, sweet, caramel like smell.Slightly bitter taste, though the various flavors stick in your mouth. As it fades, a nice smooth sweet flavor remains. A solid beer- a must have !
"
1," Highly drinkable beer thats outstanding. Very pleasant beer that took me to a better place with its subtle flavors so finely balanced.
"
1," Chimay Bleue is kind of awesome. Aroma is great, brown body, white-brown head. Just awesome. Try it !
"
1," Snifter from the brewpub.  Gack.  The aroma is all jacked up with bad fermentation character.  The flavor was all screwed up too.  Hardly any hops.  It felt like it was sticking to my teeth when I drank it.  I left all but two drinks on the table.
"
1," Creamy proud crown to this stout. Very presentable. Woody, sulphury, malt and hop accented aroma. Fine at front, medium bodied. Decent but somewhere falls apart.
"
1," From cask. Pours cloudy yellow with a small white head. Aroma is fruity, herbal, ashtray and grassy hoppy. Fruity, citrusy and crisp hoppy. Ends bitter, citrusy and mild herbal.
"
1," Bottle courtesy of secret santa.  Poured almost completely opaque black with a large frothy brown head.  Aroma of grapes and some light coffee.  Taste is some watered down coffee with a bit of buttery bourbon in the finish. Very fizzy body.
"
1," AUG 14, 2005 I have wanted for some time to find a strong ale I could really drink without grimacing.  The clean, fruity aroma and nice foam preceded a taste of dark cherries or maybe strawberries with a hint of chocolate.  The finish is slightly bitter but not sour and disappears quickly.  It doesnt detract from this one at all.  Its too heavy to drink all the time, but Im already looking forward to my next bottle.   If not for the slight fishy/metallic taste which Im told disappears with aging, this oen would rate even higher.
"
1," Dark brownish color. Smells fruity and yeasty with noticable alcohol. Flavor is very yeasty with some roast, some vinegar sour notes, lots of alcohol, chocolate, and some dried fruits. Lots going on. Layered and heavy yet smooth. Noticable alcohol. I am not a huge fan of the style.
"
1," This beer looks so delicious while being poured.  It is thick, rich, and decadent looking.  Aroma is somewhat muted but is sweet chocolate.  Flavor is coffee and more coffee with some roasted nuts and a hint of vanilla.  It has a thick sticky feel.  This is a quality stout but not an exceptional one.  Very enjoyable.
"
1," Draft-Big River-Chattanooga, TN. A small sized creamy white head with fine sized bubbles that mostly dissipated. The body was uncarbonated and clear with an orange hue. The nose was hoppy and it had a bitter and hoppy flavor to it. The mouthfeel was hoppy and this was a light-medium bodied APA with good lacing. This is a very hoppy tasting APA which isn't to my liking.
"
1," Very nice stuff. Thanks to Bardy for opening his birthday bottle. I like the spices and smoothness of this one, but I think white is better...
"
1," DEC 20, 2010 Bottle. Pours a dark ruby red beer with a nice white head. Head stays there for a while. Beer looks beautiful. Hints of fruits and yeast in the aroma. Fruity, sweet taste with a very nice hoppy aftertaste. Quite bitter. Nice brew but what else do you expect from Chimay?
"
1," Served on cask at brewpub. Pours a very dark black with a minimal dark tan head. Aroma is bourbon and coffee. Very strong bourbon aroma. Taste is like a Kentucky Breakfast Stout with a lot more coffee and a lot more bourbon. No subtelty here. Tasted more like a hard alcohol drink than a beer. ABV must be extraordinary. Not very drinkable due to huge ABV. If you love coffee and bourbon, this one is for you, but it certainly isnt for the feint of heart.
"
1," Pours copper color with two finger head that diminishes quickly.  Compared to the Chimay white I had a few minutes ago, the red is much better.  Flavor lasts longer.
"
1," Pours a deep auburn color with a off-white rocky head.  Flavor is sweet fruit and nuttiness with some light hops.  A nice smooth, dry  and slightly bitter finish.  Very good dubbel.
"
1," On tap at Big River  Chattanooga.  Poured clear lighter iced tea brown with a short, creamy cap of lighter tan head.  The aroma was soft and nutty with a pinch of cocoa.. not very involved, but pleasant.  The flavor found dry, sweet chocolate, caramel, and cola at the core with light herbal bitterness at the edges.. an odd sourness showed on the back-end and wasnt very enjoyable.  Highly-carbonated and it probably should have been less sour.. OK balance.
"
1," Big toffee smell. Very dark brown, big caramel head. Caramel, dried fruit, and alcohol shines through. Excellent, tingles on the tongue, warming complex. Fantastic
"
1," Very rich and full.  Strong maltiness with sweetness, with very noticeable alcohol in the background.  Great finish on the flavor.  Incredibly complex flavors.

1," Bottled.	Yellow colourd with a small off white head.	Aroma of malts and vegetables.	Flavour of malts and corn. Hoppy finish.
"
1," Clear dark brown in colour with average head. light malt nose with slight fruit hints. smooth malt taste that seems to linger so as to keep enjoying the flavour. fairly good lace
"
1," great beer, I love the look a totally opaque beer, a nice smell of dark malts and coco. tastes a little smokey with strong malts and bitter coffee. strong on the hop front too. one to enjoy.
"
1," 330ml bottle. Very nice beer, reminds me very much of Trois Pistoles. It definitely gets extra points for subtleties that Trois Pistoles ignores. Pours a very dark brown with tinges of murky copper at the edges. Beautiful in the Chimay glass. The nose is loaded with dark fruits, raisins, figs, plums, and apple combined with a rich malt and yeast aroma. Flavor was as expected and just as good. Nice, complex beer. I wish I could drink this every day.

1," [cask at Bon Accord] Aroma of dark fruit and roasted malt, some coffee character. medium body, dry finish.
"
1," Hazy dark brown with a nice, thick rocky white head, not very long lasting though but still pretty good. Nutty and slight fruity nose. Yeasty, spicy flavour. Nice bitter palate. A trappist beer that doesnt amaze you, but it will not disappoint you either. Medium bodied.
"
1," Not the best IPA in Portland, but very solid (and easily my favorite of the Coalition brews).  Hoppy, but leaning more toward the pine side than citrus.
"
1," bottle, thank you Frankenland. Clear golden yellow, small head, hoppy-sweet-ish nose. Medium-bodied, solid but perhaps a little too shy malty background with some nice hoppy accents. Clean and crisp, although I cant find many similarities with other Bohemian Pilseners.
"
1," Hazy and rusty orange with a big, rocky, lasting head. Very smooth and creamy with a light carbonation on the tongue. Seemed a little watery at times, but it wasnt bad; very drinkable. Juicy hops, and a surprisingly large amount of them. They carried with them notes of sweet grass, aromatic flowers, and a little citrus (mostly orange). Finish was moderately bitter, but it seemed to be much more bitter in the aftertaste. At any rate, it gave the beer a little edge. Malts occasionally shot off mild notes of chocolate and bread dough. Not a bad beer at all. Actually, it was pretty good. You have no idea how excited I was to find a brewery in one of my favorite little mountain towns ... and the fact that they werent catering specifically to the light-lager-swilling tourists that drift through town (yeah, yeah, I was a tourist, too) made me even happier.
"
1," Clean straw color with a small fading head and some lace. The aroma has notes of lemon, sweet malt, a hint of clove and orange peel, and a wheat ester. The taste is a straight forward citric and wheat overtone with a light spice background. Ever similiar to Upland Wheat Ale but not as refreshing. An okay brew, would like to try on a hot summer daze.
"
1," Bottle.  Pours a medium amber with a thin white head. The aroma is a bit of citrus, some malt.  The flavor was a smooth.  Some honey, caramel with plenty of carbonation.  Well done!
"
1," This is a ok brown ale, but really not that different from anything else.  Dogfish Heads  Indiana Brown and Bells Best Brown Ale are better examples of a brown ale.  This is pretty standard, but not as bad as 37 percentile.
"
1," NOV 8, 2009 one of my favourites, 	Pours a dark brown with dark tan head. Aroma of yeast, alcohol, spice and malts. 	The flavour is sweet ,fruity and then the taste of strong alcohol kicks in.	excellent beer , but could not drink  more then one bottle.
"
1," On nitro tap at Rock Bottom Atlanta.  Poured a dark brown with a thin, creamy brown head.  Aroma of roasted malt.  Flavor is bitter chocolate and roasted malt.  Slightly thin for a stout, but a good beer.
"
1," Certainly the best of the Chimay beers, with it being the richest and strongest (assuming one follows my personal tastes). Having tasted this after the Dogfish Head World Wide Stout, my palate has been somewhat spoilt by the richness of the WWS, although it must be noted the the Bleu is a beer I have had, loved, and continued to return to. A bit malty, but excellently balanced between sweetness and bitter hoppy flavour, with a hint of indistinct fruit.
"
1," Dark Brown, high brownish head. Aroma is not that perfect, but Appearance, Palate and Flavor... oh my... my favourite beer. Il write more detailed description later.
"
1," The aroma released while poring this beer is remarkable.  In the glass, I smell berries, nuts and alcohol.  The color is dark brown, with a reddish tint.  The taste is not as complex as I expect from a Beglian Strong.  There is definately a raisin flavor to this beer.  The alcohol is quite evident, but pleasantly warming.
"
1," The beer pours a deep cloudy brown with a thick, soft tan head. The aroma has some malts, hints of citrus, some yeast, and some hop aroma.The beer starts with a lot of malts and some fruit. More fruit and some hops in the middle, and then finishes with a little toast and chocolate. The aroma hides the alcohol well, and so does the taste - but there is some alcohol in the after-taste and it warms as it goes down. The finish is sweet (mostly malts, a little fruit). The mouthfeel is wonderful - very delicate for a beer of this strength.
"
1," A good brew with some bitter apricot taste.  Good appearance that pours well, and its a beer that even the girls will enjoy (which is good when you dont want to waste the money on wine and a good Italian restaurant).
"
1," Poured with a small, off-white head, but what was there actually stayed there for most of the time while I was drinking the beer. Body is a nice, light brown, like melted milk chocolate... almost a dark ruby red. Cloudy body.		S"
1," Thanks to Hippie4beer for the trade on some barley island stuff.  Pours a light hazy gold with a fluffy lasting white head.  Aroma reminds me of victory whirlwind with a bit more malt profile.  Phenolic lemony and bubblegum.   Flavor is lightly wheaty, more bubblegum phenols, light clove spiciness, and some citrus notes.  Smooth body but carbonation is a bit low for the style, although I did swirl the bottle to get some yeast so that may have decreased the carbonation.  Honestly better than expected.  Good wit.
"
1," Bottle. Pours clear gold/amber, thin to medium white head, spotty lacing. Nose is bright Citra hops; yep, this is definitely a Citra IPA! Big aroma of catty grapefruit, tangerine, some grass and nettle. Florals and cold cream can be found here as well. Flavours are sharply bitter, solid Citra flavours, but very one-dimensional, lightly soapy, no grain or malt character whatsoever. Solid IPA.
"
1," Flaske 33 cl. Flaske. Uklar mrk brun hlde med kaki farvet hoved af middel varighed. Aroma af gr og en smule brun farin. Smagen er forholdsvis sdelig med noter af gr, malt, mrke trrede frugter. Let brusende mundfornemmelse. Let sd afslutning og overraskende at styrken er p hele 9% alkohol
"
1," Bottle.	Pours a cloudy, very dark brown.	Fruity alcoholic aroma and flavor.	Quite gassy.	Frankly, Ive always found chimay somewhat lacking compared to its reputation. A good belgian strong ale certainly, but Ive definitely had better.	Although I understand that the flavor can vary quite a bit (what with the bottle fermentation and so on), so perhaps Ive simply been out of luck.
"
1," 750 ml bottle into a goblet.  Deep scarlet to light brown body with a quickly vanishing white head.  Aroma is intensely fruity with some phenolic notes (clove and other spices).  Taste is equally fruity with some funky earth/spicy notes.  Highly carbonated with a dry, very mild bitter finish.
"
1," Spices aroma dark brown color, off-white head, spicy taste, roasted taste, not as good as the red in my opinion.

1," 33cl bottle in local pub. Dark red brown beer ,creamy foam. tones of caramel en roasted malt.
"
1," On cask at Cloisters. Pours a dark golden colour with a decent white head. Aroma of yeast, caramel and treacle. Similar yeast and caramel flavours with barley and hay also. Mild carbonation and a foamy mouth-feel. Not for me.
"
1," Weak fig aroma. Brown pour with a thick billowy cream colored head. Tastes of fig and marshmallow. Clean, alcohol slightly noticeable. Lacking collateral qualities, but tastes very good, unoffending.
"
1," Chimay!!!  Its wonderful.  Anybody who knows what this is already knows its greatness.  Its powerful.  It tastes great.  Its Belgian.  This brew is somewhat floral in scent.  Its appearance is probaly its worst attribute, but its solid as rock there too, with its dark brown color.  Its flavor is notably alchoholic, but it also speaks malt, which I love.  Palate feel...very much lingers in a good way.  No nasty after taste.  Brilliant!!!  If your reading this stop.  Go buy a Chimay if you can afford it, thats the worst part.  Its a little pricey, but you dont need a lot to feel like a Belgian monk in full brewtasia!!!
"
1," Found this one in the Sokol restaurant, ciril Metodov trg 18 in Ljubljana.	Little hazy yellow coloured with a nice foamy white head. Very fruity herby aroma, with some clear malty and even yeasty touches. Full body. Finish is sweet-bitter, again very herby. A rather good and special beer.
"
1," Darkest brown color, no head. Aroma is awesome, and unfortunately its the pinnacle of the brew. The flavor has a bit of coffee in it, a little beer in it.
"
1," Had a bottle at the Trappistenlokaal in Delft. You would expect that a bar this dedicated to beer and especially to trappist ales, would serve it a the right temperature. Too bad the bartender served it way to cold, so most of the aroma wasnt noticeable. Had to warm the glass up between my hands to bring it to temperature. Colour was ok, looking reddish brown with a hazy glow in it. When the aroma came back eventually, it had some forest fruits like berries, abricots and really fruity yeasts. It has a really subtle body, full and round, easy to drink. Flavour is full, sugar sweetness and small hints of chocolate. Nice one.
"
1," A solid brew.  Some maltiness in the aroma and flavor.  Medium bodied.  Not too bad.
"
1," Dark body, with lots of bubbles.  Big head of grayish white bubbles.  Smells of sweet malt, peach, and a little cocoa. Very nice, refined triple taste. Big malt, sugar, maple. Delicious. Still, I liked the red better.
"
1," On tap at the brewpub.  Pours murky orange with a thick white head.  Very nice aroma of of sweet orange peel, light corriander, and wheat.  The flavor was nice with the orange peel being the prominent spice flavor.  Medium body and well carbonated.  Medium wheaty finish.  Really not all that bad of a drink.
"
1," Full amber hue, light head. Musky, husky malt aroma. Some rough, roasty notes in the nose mixed with flat hops. Bland body, flat, stale hoppiness.
"
1," I wouldn't call it red, but a cloudy orangeish-redish color.  Good head that quickly dissapaited.  Aroma is interesting, and I had a hard time pin-pointing what it was, maybe some spices, and some vanilla.  Flavor was complex and balanced.  Good all the way though.
"
1," NOV 14, 2010 Pours a deep red with a nice white head.  Lots of bread, malt, dark fruit and yeast flavors.  This was, long ago, one of my real initiations into Belgian beers and still quite wonderful.

1," 22 oz bomber-very dark brown with a huge beige head which resembles oxidization-fizzy and very small bubbles.  very oxidized nose no borubon left in the nose at all.  toasted and chared cardboard flavors.  man this is bad.  3 sips was enough.  drain pour!

1," Aroma is slightly sour, musty with a hint of hops and sweet malt. Appearance is brownish-red in the glass with cloudy consistency and pure white head. Flavour is malty, sweet with slight bitter finish.  Slight metallic taste.

1," 12 oz bottle.  Pours a clear dark brown body with a one finger frothy beige head that fell to a thin film.  The nose is light bourbon and dry chocolate malt with some cocoa powder and coffee.  The flavor is a little heavier on the bourbon, but not so much that it dominates, still a good bit of Porter there.  Very chocolaty with some light roast, vanilla, and dark licorice.  Mouthfeel is on the thinner side with a fairly dry finish.  Moderate fizzy foamy carbonation.  Overall, the nice subtle barrel aging did good things to this Porter, any more bourbon influence and it would have overpowered the base beer.  Well done.
"
1," 750 ml bottle ""shared"" with Naka.  Pours amber with fizzy, quickly dissipating head.  Lots of floaters.  Nose of apple and malt, sliht vinegar/sour, some caramel.  Taste is similar, malty caramel and toffee with lots of fruit - apple and cherry.  Alcolol is prevelant in the end and after.  Tasty, readily available, and drinkable.
"
1," Excellent off white head on this dark orange beer (Though I suspect this is more of an artifact of the Kwak glass I using).  Too much sediment floating  around the body.  Floral hop nose with some vegetable properties.  Bitter hop body a hint of biscuit from the malt.

1," 33 cl bottle, brewed 2004. Dark mahogany brown with a dark copper tone and a good transparency. A small lacy head. Rich malty nose with raisins, toffee, ripe pears, aromatic tea, a touch of coffee. A refined, yet potent, malty and slightly spicy taste with some nuts and wood and a touch of cardboard. Hops float in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel / finish is very drying and a bit burning.
"
1," my least favorite of the red, white, and blue, but still a good beer.  For the money, have one of the others.
"
1," On tap at Disneys Boardwalk. Pours black and thick with a dark chocolate head. Nice chocolate, roasted malt coffee aroma. Thick roasted malt coffee taste. Finishes with a clean dry roasted aftertaste.

1," This beer has evolved from an tasty malt-accented Vienna to a tasty hop-accented one. Ive had a lot of amber lagers from Scandinavia and this is better than any of them (ok, except maybe Appollo from Copenhagen).
"
1," 500ml bottle. Pale golden color, minimal head, that disappeared within few seconds. Aroma is malty, sweet, light hoppy in background. Aftertaste is smooth hoppy and sweet. Not bad, but also not the best one!
"
1," FEB 4, 2006 This is, of course, a classic beer, and it is not famous, like, say, Bud or Heineken, because of some advertising campagne.  I will go so far as to say that it is the best beer in Belgium or Northern France, and this says something very good about the business in general"
1," FEB 18, 2007 Bottle. This is probably the highest rating Ive given for a beer, and it was the first Trappist beer I had some four years ago. Its a total standby. Over the years Ive had other examples of quadrupels but I seem to always fall back on this one. Pours a really nice ruby and mahogany with a large, sticky and solid head. Lots of carbonation to it. Scents and flavors  of bakers chocolate, raisins, currants, some candied orange peel, and of course a high amount of alcohol. This beer is a sipper and is meant to be drunk slowly. An excellent introduction to Trappist or quadrupel beers.
"
1," Thanks to hopdog.  Pours a deep black with a smaller bubbly deep tan head that left some slight lacing.  Aroma of bourbon, oak, vanilla, some chocolate, roasted malts and light chocolate.  Flavor of roasted malts, oats, bourbon, vanilla and a touch of coffee.  Barrel aging done very nicely.
"
1," Finally tried the Chimay blue cap, so much legend and expectations behind this beer itl be hard to  rate this objectively.		Its a dark ale and has all the right characteristics.  Mild, slightly sweet flavor and head.  Mouthfeel is more viscous than I expected judging by the color and the way it poured.  Finishes nicely with a slightly bitter aftertaste at the top of the throat.

"
1," My least favorite offering from this establishment. Obviously brewed for the Bud drinking masses. Quite bland and boring. The bartender said that this was their best seller.
"
1," Corked 750ml bottle as ""Chimay Grande Reserve"" (best before end 2014) poured into a Trappist glass. Looks classy with an opaque mahogany brown body below a medium-sized dense beige head. The nose is complex and shows rich caramel and spice notes (pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg) along with dark dried fruits and candy sugar. The palate is full bodied and mellow with a sweetish malt base and a spicy and mildly bitter finish. I get a hint of liquorice in there as well. Certainly a very well integrated flavour profile with the ABV remarkably well hidden. A refined and classy beer - imagine what it would be like after a few years cellaring!
"
1," bottle. very dark brown color. roasty malty dark fruit aroma. very carpy. quite bitter and dark fruits. very complex. strong pallete.
"
1," Bottle for SPLITGRIN.  Thanks man!	Pours black with a nice tan head.  Smell is bourbon mostly followed by some creamy, sweet dark malt.  Taste is definitely bourbony, but a bit thin overall.  Some nice soft roasty stout flavors behind the bourbon, but mostly bourbon and thin dark malt otherwise.  Medium carbonation and body.  Not bad, but not especially noteworthy.
"
1," Huge spicy fruity aroma.  The flavour doesnt quite stand up so well though - a bit thin.  Almost some cherry notes to it.  The bitterness does make it a bit more interesting but doesnt flow so well.  Ill stick with blue.
"
1," 0.75L.	Strong malt aroma with burnt wood notes.	Dark brown colour with dark white head.	Hard bitter chocolate flavor with malt and bitter fruits notes in palate.	One of the best beers I have tasted.
"
1," Nice pitch black coloured body with a fast-dying light brown head. Aroma of super strong oak, bourbon, vanilla, coffee, licorice, nuts, caramel and a ton of alcohol - nice! Lightish-bodied, if that can be believed! Relatively thin mouthful with a lot of oak and bourbon at first with some mild malt, bitter nuts and a twang of vanilla at the end. Aftertaste is mild, some alcohol is noticeable, but mainly a light finish of bourbon and roasted malt - nice, since its not so strong! Overall, a very well done beer that showcases the flavours and doesnt get drowned out by the alcohol! The smaller sized bottle is another plus - perfect for the style, and this isnt even strong, so thats perfect. Id recommend this to others and will pick up the Porter the next time Im in Chicago. I sampled this twelve ounce bottle purchased from West Lakeview Liquors in Chicago, Illinois on 15-December-2008, sampled at home in Washington on 17-May-2010.
"
1," very middle of the road. big quickly dissapating head. brown with red showing in the light. yeasty wheaty almost pasta like aroma. very creamy mouthfeel. lightly sweet lightly bitter.
"
1," 12oz bottle-pours a light brown ring for a head and black color.  Aroma is wow coffee.  Taste is coffee, some hops bitterness.  Well done for the coffee lover, which isnt me.
"
1," Poured black with a beige head.  Aroma  of coffee with a little sweetness.  Flavor of spent coffee grind and sweet roasted malt.  Medium body.
"
1," Poured from a bottle the beer had an amber color. Didnt get a lot of aroma from the glass, I noticed some sweetness. Taste was good, very smooth but I think  I was expecting more.
"
1," Wow, Complex fruity taste (raisins, cherries), even with her 9% alcohol volume, there is only a little alcohol note. I would have an other anytime !
"
1," Bottle @ home. This was hidden in the back of the fridge of my parents fridge. Fairly clear, amber orange appearance with a tan head. Toasty caramel malty, earthy hoppy nose with some toffee notes. Somewhat bitter, earthy, organic hoppy, caramel, slightly toffee, chewy flavor. I realize that this isnt exactly fresh but theres not a lot interesting going on here.
"
1," This rating is based on a fresh 330ml bottle (but I prefer the 750ml bottle after 2-3 years storage, the difference is remarkable!) Dark brown body with a big, light brown head. Aroma is sweet, fruity and spicy. Flavor is complex, sweet malty, brown sugar, caramel, spices and a hint of chocolate, almost no hops. This beer is very balanced with a great, warming body. The alcohol is well hidden and almost only registered as a warm body.
"
1," Very good Belgian ale.  A little on the malty/sweet side, but the alcohol flavor does a good job of balancing the flavor.  Hop flavors are nearly non-existant in this ale. The signature Chimay yeast strain makes for  a distinctive fruity flavor.
"
1," JUL 4, 2006 I have tried all of the chimays (red, white, blue) and think that the red is by far the most exceptional of the three.  And since I bought a gift pack containing all three and a chimay glass, I figure that I should finally give them all a rating.  The chimay red is the least alcohol but the most complex.  It pours with an amber/copper color and a perfect head.  Many flavors persist in this ale.  The malt is perfectly balanced with light spice and bitterness.  This ale glows as it warms.  A great beligan ale.  Re-rate"
1," My favorite beer from the Chimay line.  Very dark, but its light, fluffy body will surprise anyone expecting a stout. Flavors are cedar, chocolate, and nuts.  Wonderful musty yeast strain gives it a great leathery taste/aroma.  Best if aged a bit. My personal choice as the worlds most soothing, relaxing beer. Drink it at room temperature in a Chimay goblet in front of the fire.  Magnificent.
"
1," For a light beer, this one is higher on the scale.  It has a very light finish and texture that makes it a good choice if you are not a big beer drinker.  I would tout this one a ""sorority girl"" beer.  You can get your date to drink it and you wont feel bad that she is.
"
1," Nice opaque dark brown with a reddish hue. Big off-white head, which fades quickly Aroma is a bit grassy, with spice and fruityness. Taste is  unremarkable and dry with bready carbonation. $3.50/11.2oz
"
1," a classic blond with fulsome bite that taste citruscitrus, medium bitterness, medium body,
"
1," JAN 14, 2006 Nice, creamy head with an absolutely wonderful aroma, slightly fruity. Malt hits you first. Followed by a little hopiness at the end that gives it just the right amount of bite and bitterness. Wonderful, I like this beer a lot. High dollar, but I will drink again! The only thing I didnt like about the beer was the cloudy, brownish color. Otherwise, it was great!
